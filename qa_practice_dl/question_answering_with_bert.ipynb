If your documents are in formats like `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.pptx`, you can supply the `use_text_extraction=True` argument to `index_from_folder`, which will use the [textract](https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to extract text from different file types and index this text into the search engine for answer rerieval.  You can also manually convert them to `.txt` files with the  `ktrain.text.textutils.extract_copy` or tools like [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) or [textract](https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  \n",

These values can be changed to speedup indexing as arguments to `index_from_list` or `index_from_folder`.  See the [whoosh documentation](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/batch.html) for more information on these parameters and how to use them to speedup indexing.

However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\\nfall, though.\\n\\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (-&gt;Talmud).\\n\\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\\n\\n\\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\\n\\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\\n\\n\\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it?

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday's Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&amp;C\\n     Communications, &amp; Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability &amp; EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA &amp; ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics &amp; Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.</td>\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\\n \\n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/\\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,\\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is \\nall I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years\\nof production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you\\nhave on this funky looking car, please e-mail.

that (hopefully) somebody can answer:\\n\\n* does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook\\nintroductions are expected?  i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an\\nappearence \"this summer\" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i\\ndon't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had\\nmore info...\\n\\n* has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the\\nones the duo's just went through recently?\\n\\n* what's the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing\\na 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have\\na feel for how much \"better\" the display is (yea, it looks great in the\\nstore, but is that all \"wow\" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit\\nsome opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth\\ntaking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize\\nthis is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the\\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\\n\\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\\n\\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a\\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\\ncorner... :( )\\n--\\nTom Willis  \\  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \\    Purdue Electrical Engineering  Purdue Electrical Engineering\n",

There were a few people who responded to my request for info on\\ntreatment for astrocytomas through email, whom I couldn't thank\\ndirectly because of mail-bouncing probs (Sean, Debra, and Sharon).  So\\nI thought I'd publicly thank everyone.\\n\\nThanks! \\n\\n(I'm sure glad I accidentally hit \"rn\" instead of \"rm\" when I was\\ntrying to delete a file last September. \"Hmmm... 'News?' What's\\nthis?\"....)                           None\n",

right about SCSI\\nSCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}\\n Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1\\n so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too.\\nSCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst\\nSCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst\\nSCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\\n \\nBy your OWN data the \"Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI\" is correct\\nWith a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed\\n\"20% faster than IDE\" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been\\nposted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on \\nsumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as \\nmac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}\\n\\nPart of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI\\nis which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip\\nan Apple salesperson said \"it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip\" {Not at a 6MB/s,\\n10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra\\nuses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see\\nSCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven\\nin the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH\\nFASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.                       stanford\n",

            \\n\\n\\nI've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,\\nbut not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,\\nthe owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this\\nfrom memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)\\n\\nUsing the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's\\nhard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,\\nif I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,\\nthe icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing\\nproblem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress\\na board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.\\n\\nSince Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes\\nin Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.\\nWhich is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since\\nthey're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)\\n--                            None\n",

Runs\\nvery well, paint is the bronze/brown/orange faded out, leaks a bit of oil\\nand pops out of 1st with hard accel.  The shop will fix trans and oil \\nleak.  They sold the bike to the 1 and only owner.  They want $3495, and\\nI am thinking more like $3K.  Any opinions out there?  Please email me.\\nThanks.  It would be a nice stable mate to the Beemer.  Then I'll get\\na jap bike and call myself Axis Motors!\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"Tuba\" (Irwin)      \"I honk therefore I am\"     CompuTrac-Richardson,Tx\\nirwin@cmptrc.lonestar.org    DoD #0826          (R75/6)                           None\n",

I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\\nfall, though.\\n\\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\\n\\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\\n\\n\\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\\n\\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\\n\\n\\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:                           None\n",

let's keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday's Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.

After all, it seems that the Nazis originally\\nonly intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly\\nbecause they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation\\ncaused by Goering's Total War.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\\n \\n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

                                  I would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is\\noutput from a thermocouple, preferably by a factor of\\n100 or 1000 ---- so that the resulting voltage can be fed\\nmore easily into a personal-computer-based ADC data\\nacquisition card.\\n\\nMight anyone be able to point me to references to such\\ncircuits?  I have seen simple amplifier circuits before, but\\nI am not sure how well they work in practice.\\n\\nIn this case, I'd like something which will amplify sufficiently\\n\"nicely\" to be used for thermocouples (say, a few degrees\\naccuracy or better).

system \\nto the TCP/IP access control list?   \\n\\n  BACKGROUND:\\n  I have two unix systems, 1. an AT&T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT's X11R4 and \\n2. a Sun SS10 without any X.  \\n  I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the\\nsame time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP\\nAccess Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!  \\n  I've tried to get \"xhost\" to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong\\nor the X11R3 implementation is bogus.  \\n  I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the \\nNCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit, the NCD still boots with\\nthe TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2.\\n  My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!  Thanks!                          MIT's\n",

Speaking of the Leafs, I believe that\\nDarryl Sittler was their captain (he'd torn the \"C\" off his\\njersey but I think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he\\nwas traded to the Flyers.\\n\\nOh yeah, of course, Gretzky was the captain of the Oilers before\\nhe was traded wasn't he?

                   I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your\\nmessage, but I definitely had SCSI problems between my\\nQ700 and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive 10 cartridge\\ndrives.  My solution was to get Silverlining.  None of\\nthe loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives;\\nin fact the only loop that worked was the \"Macintosh\\nSoftware\" loop (whatever that means).                           None"
