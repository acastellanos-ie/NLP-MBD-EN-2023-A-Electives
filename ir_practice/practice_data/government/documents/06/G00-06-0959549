   Buffalo Division Initiatives : The FBI, in conjunction with the United
   States Attorney's Office, Buffalo Police Department, and Erie County
   District Attorney's Office, has created a Working Group whose focus is
   a joint approach to Hate Crimes in the Western New York area. It is a
   combined local and federal initiative which will take a proactive,
   multi-tiered approach to the problem. This will include specialized
   training, coordinated response efforts to the needs of victims,
   proactive community contacts, shared intelligence, vigorous
   investigation, and where appropriate, aggressive prosecution.
   All citizens, witnesses, and victims have a confidential method of
   making the law enforcement community aware of Hate Crimes through the
   establishment of a 24-hour telephone number. Anyone wishing to make
   contact on a confidential basis can provide information at
   1-800-894-1969.
