   Welcome to the Protein Structure Prediction Center!

   Our goal is to help advance the methods of identifying protein
   structure from sequence. The Center has been organized to provide the
   means of objective testing of these methods via the process of blind
   prediction. In addition to support of the CASP meetings our goal is to
   promote an objective evaluation of prediction methods on a continuing
   basis.

   The Center, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of
   Biological and Environmental Research, is a part of the Biology and
   Biotechnology Research Program at the Lawrence Livermore National
   Laboratory.
