    Last Updated: January 9, 2002

   The Office of Compliance was established to implement and enforce the
   Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. Known as the CAA, the Act
   generally extends the rights and protections of 11 employment and labor
   laws to covered employees in the legislative branch of the federal
   government. The CAA also makes it unlawful for any employing office to
   intimidate, retaliate against, or otherwise take negative action
   against a covered employee for opposing an unlawful practice,
   initiating proceedings or bringing a claim under the CAA, or for
   testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the CAA.
   The CAA applies only to alleged violations occurring on or after
   January 23, 1996. Workplace practices can be challenged only if they
   violate a statutory requirement or prohibition of the CAA.
