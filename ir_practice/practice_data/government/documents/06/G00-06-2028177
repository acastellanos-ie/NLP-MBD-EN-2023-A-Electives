   The National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Team and the Global Change and
   Climate History Team have merged to form the Earth Surface Processes Team!

      This website presents information related to activities of the former
      Global Change and Climate History Team. Please visit our other website
      for information related to activities of the former National
      Cooperative Geologic Mapping Team. As soon as possible, these two
      websites will be replaced by a single, redesigned ESP Team website. On
      the 'net, as in the interrelated systems of Earth, change is continuous
      and gradual...please bear with us.
