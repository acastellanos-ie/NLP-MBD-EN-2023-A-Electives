   QuarkNet brings high school students and teachers to the frontier of
   21st century research that seeks to resolve some of the mysteries about
   the structure of matter and the fundamental forces of nature.

   QuarkNet centers are connected to high-energy physics experiments
   operating at CERN in Switzerland, at Fermilab in Illinois, at SLAC in
   California, and others. Within two years, we expect to form 60 centers
   associated with research groups at universities and labs across the
   U.S. (34 already are operational).

   [pict4.jpg] Physicists mentor and collaborate with high school
   teachers. Through these collaborations:
     * Students learn fundamental physics as they analyze live online data
       and participate in inquiry-oriented investigations.
     * Teachers join research teams with physicists at a local university
       or laboratory.
