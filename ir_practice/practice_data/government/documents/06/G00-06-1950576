   Funding For Vest Purchases
   The Bulletproof Vest Grant Acts of 1998 (Public Law 105-181) and 2000
   (Public Law 106-517) assist States (includes the District of Columbia,
   Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern
   Mariana Islands), units of local government, and Indian tribes, in
   obtaining funds to purchase ballistic and stab vests for their law
   enforcement officers. Any vest purchased after March 1, 1999 that meets
   applicable National Institute of Justice standards is eligible for
   funding, using an electronic, Internet-based application and payment
   request process. The entire process of obtaining federal funds is
   completed through this web site.
   Dates to Remember
     * The 2002 application submission period ends April 13, 2002.
     * The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 was recently
       enacted. This means the program will remain in effect for three
       more years, from 2002 to 2004.
     * NIJ-approved vests purchased on or after March 1, 1999 are eligible
       for funding.

   Funding Limitations
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership (BVP) Grant Act of 2000 provides
   funding priority for jurisdictions with populations under 100,000.
   Based upon availability of funds, these smaller jurisdictions will
   receive the full 50% of requested funds in approved applications. For
   larger jurisdictions with populations at or over 100,000, the program
   will pay up to 50% of each applicant's total vest costs, based upon any
   remaining funds. Specific funding levels for larger jurisdictions will
   be determined once all applications have been submitted. Given the
   projected number of eligible jurisdictions and the limited funds
   available, the BVP may not have sufficient funds to provide 50% for
   applications from larger jurisdictions.
   It is strongly recommended that jurisdictions and law enforcement
   agencies not order vests contained in their application until approved
   by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), unless they have sufficient
   resources to cover initial costs and any potential shortfall that may
   result if less than 50% is provided by DOJ.

   FGIP Logo The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program is pleased to
   announce the program was the Internet-Based Solution Winner of the 1999
   Intergovernmental Open Systems Solution Gold Award!
