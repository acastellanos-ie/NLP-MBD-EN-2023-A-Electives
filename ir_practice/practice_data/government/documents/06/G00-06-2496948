   QuickTime Movie describing MODIS and its mission - both a large,
   hi-resolution version (34 MB) and a smaller, faster-downloading version
   (3.5 MB).

   L1B V3.0.0 entered operations on May 29, 2001. For more details, see
   the "L1B Product Info & Status" page.

   Terra (PFM) Instrument Status
   On December 13, 2001 (data day 2001347), MODIS closed its Nadir
   Aperture Door (NAD, i.e., the earth view door) at 14:45 GMT in
   preparation for a Terra Inclination maneuver. The NAD re-opened at
   16:29.

   The MODIS instrument experienced a Power Supply 2 (PS2) shutdown
   anomaly and did not take science data during the time period June 15,
   2001 to July 2, 2001. The cause of the failure is consistent with an
   over-voltage shutdown most likely initiated by a high-energy radiation
   event that caused the Metal-oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor
   (MOSFET) within the down-regulator of PS2 to fail. Immediately prior to
   the anomaly, MODIS had been acquiring data using electronics side-B.

   When the MODIS recovered, it was commanded to take science mode data
   using Power Supply 1 and electronics side A. Science data collected
   since recovery show that the instrument is performing as expected.
   However, the then-existing lookup tables used for L1B processing of
   post-anomaly data were from calibrations using electronics side B, so
   L1B and downstream products from the post-anomaly period processed in
   July 2001 were imprecise and will remain so until new lookup tables are
   constructed and implemented using post-anomaly calibrations. The error
   introduced can amount to 5% for the reflective solar bands. The thermal
   emissive bands are less prone to error because they are calibrated with
   each scan using the on-board blackbody which was turned on at 18:06:50
   July 3, 2001 (day 2001184).

   MCST delivered the new LUTs (lookup tables) to the DAAC during the last
   week of July 2001. The current LUT, version 3.0.0.6, is being used to
   help produce a consistent data set starting from October 30, 2000 (day
   2000304) forward to the present. Revised L1B code and LUT histories
   have been installed in the L1B Product Info and Status section.

   The current Terra MODIS Relative Spectral Response (RSR) is available
   for Terra (PFM). Download the contents of directory. The Readme files
   contain format information.

   The detailed operations are documented in the Weekly Reports and the
   Terra MODIS History buttons under the Instrument Ops buttons on this
   web page.

   Aqua (FM1) Mission Status
   [spacer.gif]
   MODIS is integrated onto the Aqua spacecraft, which will begin
   spacecraft thermal vacuum testing in early 2001. The saturation
   brightness temperatures for Bands 31 and 32 have been reduced to near
   340 K for this mission. The current launch schedule for this mission is
   no earlier than March, 2002. The Aqua Mission is described at
   http://eos-pm.gsfc.nasa.gov.
