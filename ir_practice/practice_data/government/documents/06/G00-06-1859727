                    Goddard Engineering Colloquium Series

                          Dr Goddard and his Rocket

   "It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday
     is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow." --Dr. Robert H.
                            Goddard (1882 - 1945)

                           --General Information--

   Each spring and fall, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in
   Greenbelt, Maryland, presents a series of colloquia on a wide range of
   engineering as well as nonengineering topics. Presented at about the
   level of Scientific American articles, the talks have proven to be
   quite popular not only with our technical community of engineers and
   scientists but also with a more general audience. The current
   Engineering Colloquium Charter was adopted in 1997.

   The colloquia are held at 3:30 p.m. on Mondays. They are held in either
   the Building 3 Auditorium or the Building 8 Auditorium, as indicated.
   Coffee and tea will be provided in the auditorium lobby starting at
   3:00 p.m., courtesy of the Goddard Employee Welfare Association.

   Note: Individuals not badged for entry into Goddard should obtain the
   current procedure by contacting Main Gate security at 301-286-7211.
