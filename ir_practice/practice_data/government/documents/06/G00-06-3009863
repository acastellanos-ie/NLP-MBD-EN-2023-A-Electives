Ocean Exploration

   Similar to President Thomas Jefferson's desire to explore the American
   West in the 19th Century, President William Jefferson Clinton has
   directed the Department of Commerce to convene a panel of leading ocean
   explorers, scientists and educators to recommend a national strategy
   for a new era of ocean exploration. Exploring the Earth's final
   frontier may hold clues to the origin of life on our blue planet, cures
   for human disease, answers on how to achieve sustainable use of our
   oceans, links to our maritime history, and information to protect the
   endangered species of the sea. This Web site will provide the backbone
   of information needed for the Ocean Exploration Panel to provide
   recommendations to the President of the United States of America. The
   Panel report entitled "Discovering Earth's Final Frontier: A U.S.
   Strategy for Ocean Exploration" is a historic accomplishment because it
   is the only national strategy proposed for exploration of the global
   oceans by any country in the world. The final printed version of this
   report will be available by January 2001, if you have any further
   questions regarding the Ocean Exploration Panel report, please contact
   NOAA Public Affairs at 202.482.6090.
