   MISSION STATEMENT

   The mission of the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric
   Technicians is to protect the public welfare by ensuring that only
   qualified persons are licensed vocational nurses and psychiatric
   technicians by enforcing education requirements, standards of practice
   and by educating consumers of their rights.
   NOTICE TO CONSUMERS

   With emerging technology, many health care services, such as online
   medical advice, are now available via the internet. Please keep in mind
   that all practicing licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) or psychiatric
   technicians (PTs) in California must have a current (unexpired) and
   active license in California. An LVN must work under the direction of a
   licensed registered nurse or physician, and a PT must work under a
   licensed registered nurse, physician, or Director of Services. See
   Business and Professions Code Sections 2859, 2860.5, and 4502.

   If you have any concerns regarding the licensed status of an LVN or PT,
   please go to the Online License Verification page to verify the status
   of their license.

   For further information, please refer to the Board's "Forms &
   Publications" and "Enforcement" sections of this website.

   Please note: The Board can ONLY provide information regarding licensed
   vocational nurses and psychiatric technicians. We cannot assist you
   with questions regarding registered nurses, certified nursing
   assistants, psychologists, medical assistants or any other related
   profession. See our links page for links to other agencies.
