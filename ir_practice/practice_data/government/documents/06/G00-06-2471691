   Office of Historic Preservation
   Welcome to OHP




California is characterized by a rich historical past and a bright,
promising future. The State's historical resources represent the
contributions and collective human experiences of a diversified
population spanning 10,000-12,000 years of occupancy in California.
This heritage is embodied in the cultural and historical landscapes of
California as evidenced by the archaeological remains, historic
buildings, traditional customs, tangible artifacts, historical
documents, and public records extant in California. All these evidences
of the past contribute to the sum total of California's history. Such
historical resources provide continuity with our past and enhance our
quality of life.
