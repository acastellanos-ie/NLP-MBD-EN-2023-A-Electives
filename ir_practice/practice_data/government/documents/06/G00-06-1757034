       NIST AND NSA LAUNCH HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY REQUIREMENTS PROJECT

    The events of September 11th have strengthened our resolve to protect
   the information systems and networks that play an important role in the
   United States critical information infrastructure. Fighting the war on
    terrorism will be a multifaceted undertaking with renewed efforts in
   the area of cyber-security. NIST and NSA have recently announced a new
   collaborative effort to produce comprehensive security requirements and
   security specifications for key technologies that will be used to build
        more secure systems for our Federal Agencies. These security
       requirements and security specifications will be developed with
      significant industry involvement and employ the new international
       security standard known as the Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408).
   Protection profiles in key technology areas such as operating systems,
    firewalls, smart cards, biometrics devices, database systems, public
       key infrastructure components, network devices, virtual private
     networks, intrusion detection systems, and web browsers will be the
    primary focus of this high priority project. The National Information
   Assurance Partnership web site will be the primary distribution vehicle
      used to disseminate information on the status of all development
     efforts associated with this project. Additional information can be
    obtained by downloading the project description or by contacting Dr.
        Stuart Katzke, NIAP Senior Technical Advisor, (301) 975-4768.

     ITL's Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Research Saves Industry $295
                                   Million
      A new independent economic impact study conducted by the Research
      Triangle Institute (RTI) conservatively estimates that ITL's RBAC
        research has saved U.S. industry $295 million and accelerated
    industry's adoption of this advanced access control method by a year.
       ITL's research cost taxpayers only $2.3 million. The RTI study
     quantifies the benefits of RBAC and estimates NIST's impact on the
    development and adoption of RBAC by industry and the user community.
    RTI estimated that RBAC technology has saved U.S. industry a total of
     $671 million, and that ITL's work was responsible for 44 percent of
                           this savings. Read More

    NIST DRAFT Computer Security Special Publication 800-34 Now Available
                                 for Review

   The draft NIST Special Publication 800-34, "Contingency Planning Guide
    for Information Technology Systems" is available for public comment.
   The document provides instructions, recommendations, and considerations
    for government IT contingency planning. The information presented in
        this document addresses seven IT platform types and defines a
   seven-step contingency process that an agency may apply to develop and
    maintain a viable contingency planning program for their IT systems.
    The seven steps are designed to be integrated into each stage of the
   system development life cycle. Please provide any comments to Marianne
   Swanson by February 15, 2002. URL to view the DRAFT Special Publication
                                   800-34:

                 Two New Draft Security Documents for Review
   December 14, 2001 -- NIST has recently developed the draft NIST Special
   Publication · Security for Telecommuting and Broadband Communications.
     This document is intended to assist those responsible users, system
   administrators, and management for telecommuting security, by providing
     introductory information about broadband communication security and
   policy, security of home office systems, and considerations for system
   administrators in the central office. It addresses concepts relating to
    the selection, deployment, and management of broadband communications
     for a telecommuting user. We would greatly appreciate receiving any
   comments you may have! Please provide them directly to · Rick Kuhn by
                              January 18, 2002.

   December 14, 2001 -- The draft · Guide for Interconnecting Information
   Systems is available for public comment. The document provides guidance
          for planning, establishing, maintaining, and terminating
       interconnections between information systems that are owned and
       operated by different organizations. We seek your comments and
   suggestions. We especially seek your comments on the steps for planning
     and establishing an interconnection, based on readers' experiences.
   Furthermore, we are interested in receiving comments on the memorandum
   of understanding/agreement development guide contained in the document.
    Please address your comments to · Timothy Grance and · Joan Hash by
                              January 18, 2002.

               Usability Test Report Format Standards Adopted
      At a meeting of the National Committee for Information Technology
     Standards, the Executive Board approved the Common Industry Format
   (CIF) for Usability Test Reports (NCITS 354). The document standardizes
    the types of information captured in the software development testing
   process. Usability is a key factor in predicting successful deployment
    of software, and the standard will enable human factors engineers and
   usability professionals in software development companies to report the
   methods and results of usability tests to customers in a common format.
     The CIF, developed through a series of workshops sponsored by NIST,
    became a standard in the remarkably short time of 4.5 months, using a
        Fast-Track Process. The standard has gone to ANSI for a final
    procedural review and ANSI approval. More information can be found at
                 www.ncits.org/press/2001/CIFfasttrackpr.htm
