     The International Comparisons Database (ICDB) serves the U.S. and the
   Inter-American System of Metrology (SIM) with information based on
   Appendices B and D of the Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures
   (CIPM) Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). The official source of the
   data is The BIPM key comparison database. The ICDB provides access to
   results of comparisons of measurements and standards organized by the
   consultative committees of the CIPM and the Regional Metrology
   Organizations.
