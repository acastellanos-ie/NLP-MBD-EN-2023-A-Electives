                    Elementary Particles and Field Theory

  Introduction

   This is the home page of the Elementary Particles and Field Theory
   Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). T-8 is one of the
   research groups in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos. Members of
   T-8 carry out research in particle physics (standard model and beyond),
   nonequilibrium field theory, conformal field theory, string theory,
   accelerator physics, fundamental issues in quantum mechanics,
   cosmology, biology, and particle astrophysics.
