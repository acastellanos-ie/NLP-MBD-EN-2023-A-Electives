   Join us this summer for the third field season of the Sustainable Seas
   Expeditions (SSE). SSE 2001, named "
   Islands in the Stream," is a project of ocean exploration, research,
   education, and public outreach. Scientists and educators will explore
   protected and non-protected coral reef and hard bottom communities --
   the "islands" -- of Belize, Mexico and the United States, as well as
   the currents -- the "stream" -- that connect the different habitats.
   The expedition will be chronicled on a new Web site called, NOAA Ocean
   Explorer.

   [islandsmap.jpg] Underwater communities throughout the Gulf of Mexico,
   as well as those in the western Atlantic along the coast of Florida and
   Georgia, are connected by the Loop Current, its associated gyres, and
   the Gulf Stream. Beginning off the coast of Belize, the expedition team
   will ride the clockwise "stream" along the eastern edge of the Yucatan
   Peninsula, into the Flower Garden Banks sanctuary off Texas, continue
   downward along the west coast of Florida, through the Florida Keys
   sanctuary, up the east coast of Florida, and conclude off North
   Carolina in the Monitor sanctuary.

   During the 2000 field season, the exploration team conducted more than
   100 successful submersible dives in the DeepWorker 2000. Most dives
   were 2 to 4 hours in length, and reached depths well beyond those
   accessible via scuba. One dive in the Channel Islands reached a depth
   of 2,004 ft.
