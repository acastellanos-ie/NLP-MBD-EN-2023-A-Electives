   Water Resources of Maine

   As the nation's largest water, earth and biological science and
   civilian mapping agency the USGS works in cooperation with more than
   2000 organizations cross the country to provide reliable, impartial,
   scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other
   customers. This information is gathered in every state by USGS
   scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural
   disasters, contribute to sound economic and physical development of the
   nation's natural resources, and enhance the quality of life by
   monitoring water, biological, energy, and mineral resources.
