   The Lake Erie - Niagara River Ice Boom

   Each winter since 1964, the New York Power Authority and Ontario Power
   Generation, Inc. have installed an ice boom at the eastern end of Lake
   Erie. The 8,800-foot span, composed of floating steel pontoons, is used
   to reduce the volume of ice released from Lake Erie into the upper
   Niagara River. Unrestricted ice runs can impede water flows to the
   areas two large hydroelectric facilities, the Power Authoritys
   Niagara Power Project and Ontario Power Generation, Inc.s Sir Adam
   Beck Generating Stations.

   This section of our web site provides information about the Power
   Authoritys and Ontario Power Generation, Inc.'s ice-management
   efforts, including a field study that evaluated a recent design change
   in the ice boom. More importantly, it allows users to view the ice boom
   and actual ice conditions on Lake Erie and the Niagara River through
   near real-time video images from cameras overlooking Buffalo Harbor.
   First-hand knowledge of ice conditions is important for forecasting the
   availability of power from Niagara River hydro projects, since
   reductions in power generation can occur within 12 hours of a lake ice
   run.
