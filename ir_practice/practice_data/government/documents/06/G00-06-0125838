   About the NGI

   The Next Generation Internet (NGI) Program has been successfully
   completed and the Federal agencies are currently coordinating advanced
   networking research programs under the Large Scale Networking (LSN)
   Coordinating Group. Please see the LSN Website at
   www.itrd.gov/iwg/pca/lsn.
   The NGI Program met all of its goals except for its goal of Terabit per
   second networking in FY2002 that is expected to be met by the current
   LSN research activities.
