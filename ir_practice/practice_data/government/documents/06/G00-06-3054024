   The University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI), the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Montgomery County
   have jointly established the Center for Advanced Research in
   Biotechnology (CARB), a unique forum for collaborative research among
   academic, government, and industry scientists.

   CARB, located on the University of Maryland's Shady Grove Campus at the
   Shady Grove Life Science Center in Rockville, lies in the heart of
   Maryland's thriving biotechnology community. Also, it is near all
   Maryland's major university research campuses and several government
   laboratories, including the National Institutes of Health. The 85,000
   square-foot facility that houses CARB was designed to meet the specific
   needs of the biotechnology community in the field of protein structure,
   function, and design. Scientists from the Biotechnology Division of the
   Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory of NIST and the University
   of Maryland have come together to conduct research programs in
   structural and physical biochemistry and molecular biology. CARB, with
   sophisticated state-of-the-art instrumentation, provides an exceptional
   environment for training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in
   fields critical to the future of biotechnology. CARB offers a Visiting
   Scientists Program that allows researchers from industrial, academic,
   and governmental laboratories to work at the facility for extended
   periods.
