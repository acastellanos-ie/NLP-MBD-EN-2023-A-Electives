     Women in Agriculture

                 Welcome to our Women in Agriculture website

   We created the Women in Agriculture (WIA) website to follow-up on the
   First and Second International Conferences for Women in Agriculture
   (ICWA), and to prepare for the Third International Conference that will
   be held in Spain in 2002.

   Our dialogue with women during the second conference -- held in
   Washington, D.C. -- made it clear that it is vitally important for
   women in agriculture to have an ongoing communications network. We want
   to help you make connections with other women in the agriculture
   community to share information, trade ideas, and increase your
   opportunities and resources.
