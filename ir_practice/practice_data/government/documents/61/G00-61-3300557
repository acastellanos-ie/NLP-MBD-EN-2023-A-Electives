   VONAPP JavaScript Alert: We have automatically detected that you have
   your computer set to not accept "JavaScript". You must have your
   computer set to accept JavaScript before you can begin using Veterans
   On-Line Applications (VONAPP).
   What is "JavaScript"? JavaScript is the name for a type of computer
   programming developed by Netscape Communications which we use to design
   Internet applications.
   What must I do to allow my computer to accept JavaScript? You must
   change settings on your Internet browser to accept JavaScript. VONAPP
   allows use of two types of web browsers: Internet Explorer (IE), and
   Netscape. Each browser requires a different procedure to change
   settings. Also, IE and Netscape exist in different versions requiring
   slightly different steps to change settings.
   How do I know which version of IE is on my computer? At the top of your
   screen in the toolbar, click on Help, then click About Internet
   Explorer. The screen that pops up will show the version number.
   The following instructions are for changing IE versions 5.01 and 5.5,
   the most popular browser and versions currently selected by VONAPP
   users.

   To view and modify session cookie settings, follow these steps:
         1. In Internet Explorer 5.01 and 5.5, click on Tools, then
   Internet Options, and then click on the Security tab.
         2. Then click Custom Level
         3. Under Scripting/Active Scripting options select Enable, click
   OK, and then click OK.
   You may now reenter VONAPP by closing this browser window and opening a
   new window.
