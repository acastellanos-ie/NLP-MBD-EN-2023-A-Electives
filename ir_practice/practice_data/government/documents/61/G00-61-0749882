    The National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) is an independent federal
   organization leading the national effort toward a fully literate nation
                            in the 21st century.

   Our society is increasingly being shaped by volumes of new information
    and knowledge. To live and prosper in this society, all of us must be
   lifelong learners, with access to knowledge and skills that can sustain
      our lives at work, at home, and in their communities. At least 40
    million adults in the U.S. need stronger literacy skills in order to
     take full advantage of continuing lifelong learning opportunities.

      NIFL's mission is to ensure that the highest quality of literacy
     services is available to these adults. By fostering communication,
     collaboration, and innovation, NIFL works to build and strengthen a
           comprehensive, unified system for literacy in the U.S.
