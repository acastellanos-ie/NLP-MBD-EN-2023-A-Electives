                   OCULINA BANK AND THE WEST FLORIDA SHELF


   Welcome! This site details ongoing projects involving a joint USGS,
   NOAA, and FSU team. USGS geologists are collaborating with biologists
   from the USGS/Biological Resources Division (BRD), National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration/National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),
   and Florida State University to analyze the geological and
   paleoecological characteristics of the seafloor. The purpose is to
   understand how the geological attributes and paleoecology of the
   seafloor affect the biological habitats of the fish. This will
   ultimately help determine rational site criteria for no-harvest refugia
   so fish stocks can be protected and managed for future generations.

   Seafloor characterization and mapping utilizes sidescan sonar, seismic
   reflection profiling, sediment sampling, and underwater photography and
   video. Collaborating biologists collect data on fish population
   densities, species distributions,spawning behavior, and feeding
   activities. The data are being combined in a multi-disciplinary,
   multi-agency geographic information system (GIS), which provides a
   rational basis for fisheries management decisions. We also produce
   publications (see USGS Openfile Report  99-10 and 99-589, and the
   Marine Habitat Mapping Newsletters) and give talks on the relationships
   between seafloor geology and benthic and pelagic biologic communities,
   the development and distribution of modern and relict morphologic and
   sedimentary features, and the paleoecology of the region.
