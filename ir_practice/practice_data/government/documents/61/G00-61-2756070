      The International Space Station, or ISS, represents a global
      partnership of 16 nations. This project is an engineering, scientific
      and technological marvel ushering in a new era of human space
      exploration. The million-pound space station will include six
      laboratories and provide more space for research than any spacecraft
      ever built. Internal volume of the space station will be roughly equal
      to the passenger cabin volume of a 747 jumbo jet.

      More than 40 space flights over five years and at least three space
      vehicles the space shuttle, the Russian Soyuz rocket and the Russian
      Proton rocket will deliver the various space station components to
      Earth orbit. Assembly of the more than 100 components will require a
      combination of human space walks and robot technologies.

                 Unity module is mated with Zarya module
   The STS-88 crew uses the robotic arm to mate the Unity module to the
   Zarya module.
      Sixteen flights, which includes 12 space shuttle missions, have already
      occurred in the International Space Station era. The first flight was a
      Russian Proton rocket that lifted off in November 1998 and placed the
      Zarya module in orbit. In early December of that same year, the STS-88
      mission saw Space Shuttle Endeavour attach the Unity module to Zarya
      initiating the first ISS assembly sequence. The third ISS mission was
      STS-96 in June 1999 with Discovery supplying the two modules with tools
      and cranes.
      The fourth flight to the space station was STS-101, which launched May
      19, 2000. The seven-member crew of STS-101 performed maintenance tasks
      and delivered supplies in preparation for the arrival of the Zvezda
      Service Module and the station's first permanent crew. Zvezda, the
      fifth flight, docked with the station on July 25 at 7:45 p.m. CDT, or
      July 26 at 00:45 GMT, and became the third major component of the
      station. Then, STS-106 visited the station in September to deliver
      supplies and outfit Zvezda in preparation for the station's first
      permanent crew, which arrived at the station on Nov. 2. Prior to the
      Expedition One crew's arrival, STS-92 delivered the Z1 Truss,
      Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 and four Control Moment Gyros in October.

      STS-97 was the last shuttle mission of the 20th century. Space Shuttle
      Endeavour and its five-member crew installed the first set of U.S.
      solar arrays onto the station and became the first shuttle crew to
      visit Expedition One. The solar arrays set the stage for the arrival of
      the U.S. Destiny Laboratory Module, which arrived at the station in
      February 2001 on STS-98. The five STS-98 astronauts also relocated
      Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 from the end of Unity to the end of
      Destiny to set the stage for future shuttle missions.

      In March 2001, the first crew rotation flight arrived. STS-102
      delivered the Expedition Two crew to the station and returned
      Expedition One to Earth. Also, STS-102 carried the first Multi-Purpose
      Logistics Module, Leonardo, to the station. Logistics modules are
      reusable cargo carriers built by the Italian Space Agency. Expedition
      One spent 4.5 months on the station.

      STS-100 delivered the station's robot arm, which is also known as the
      Space Station Remote Manipulator System, and the Raffaello
      Multi-Purpose Logistics Module in April. The delivery of the arm set
      the stage for the arrival of the station's joint airlock, which was
      installed during STS-104's visit to the station in July 2001.

      The next shuttle mission to visit the station was STS-105 in mid-August
      2001. STS-105 delivered the Expedition Three crew to the International
      Space Station and returned the Expedition Two crew to Earth. The
      Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module made its second trip to the
      station during STS-105.

      ISS expansion continued with the arrival of the Russian Docking
      Compartment on Sept. 16, 2001. The docking Compartment is called Pirs,
      which is the Russian word for pier.

      The next flight to visit the space station was STS-108. It arrived at
      the station in early December 2001 and delivered the Expedition Four
      crew. Expedition Three returned to Earth on STS-108. The first shuttle
      mission scheduled to visit the station in 2002 is STS-110.

      The United States and Russia have partnered together since 1994
      performing nine Shuttle-Mir dockings. That experience provided valuable
      insight and team work necessary for building and maintaining the
      International Space Station.

      When the space station is completed an international crew of up to
      seven will live and work in space between three and six months. Crew
      return vehicles will always be attached to the space station to ensure
      the safe return of all crewmembers in the event of an emergency.
