 For you experts, include our content from this XML feed as well, giving
                            you full control over the look on your page.

    Do you have a NASA- or Space-related web site?  Or just your own home
    page?  Make your page impressive with the latest news from NASA.  All
    you have to do is set it up, and your page will automatically update
    daily with the latest NASA news.  All that is required is a few simple
    HTML JavaScript tags that work with Internet Explorer and Netscape
    browsers, version 4.0 and later.

    See a sample of what your page source and the results would look like.

 STEP 1   Add this between your page's <HEAD> tags.  Note: this
          capability works on all the 4.0 and later browsers.

          <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"
          SRC="http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/content.js"></SCRIPT>
 STEP 2   Choose the information you want to show on your page.
            * LIFTOFF NEWS - latest science and space related stories updated
              weekly. Written to be understood by everyone -- see our home page
              for a sample (5 latest included by script) .
            * SCIENCE @ NASA - latest science stories written for the science
              literate (5 latest included by script).
            * SPACE Calendar - today's events from the Space Calendar.
            * Check back here often as we may add more headlines.

 STEP 3   Add the desired script code to your page wherever you wish.

          Sample 1: Include Story Title and Introduction Text

            <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="Javascript"><!--
            nasaShowLeadIn("Liftoff", 1, 5);
            //--></SCRIPT>

            You can select how many stories to show.  In this sample, you are
            selecting all 5.  If you only wanted the first story, you would have
            1, 1.  For the Science @ NASA Stories, put "Science" as the first
            field instead of "Liftoff".

          Sample 2: Include Just the Story Title

            <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="Javascript"><!--
            nasaShowHeadline("Liftoff", 1, 5);
            //--></SCRIPT>

            You can select how many stories to show.  In this sample, you are
            selecting all 5.  If you only wanted the first story, you would have
            1, 1.  For the Science @ NASA Stories, put "Science" as the first
            field instead of "Liftoff".

          Sample 3: Include the Space Calendar

            <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="Javascript"><!--
            nasaShowCal();
            //--></SCRIPT>

 Extra    You can change the way the included headlines look by putting a
          <SPAN> tags around your calls:

            <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11px; font-family: Arial; color: red">
            <!-- your calls here -->
            </SPAN>



    That's it!  Here is a sample page that we created to show you how it
    would look.
