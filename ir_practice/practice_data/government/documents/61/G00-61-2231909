        PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND HEALTH PROMOTION FOR PERSONS WITH SCI

   Objective:
     * Create a process for critically evaluating the value and
       effectiveness of preventive and health promotion services for
       persons with SCI.

   Rationale:
     * Due to the loss of sensation and/or movement in persons with SCI,
       signs and symptoms of disease are different and typically present
       later than in the able-bodied population, if at all.
     * Certain conditions have an increased incidence of morbidity and
       mortality for persons with SCI.
     * Preventive screening tools routinely used for persons with SCI have
       not been empirically examined to evaluate their effectiveness.
     * Screening tools supported by evidence-based research utilized in
       the able-bodied population have not been critically evaluated in
       persons with SCI.

   Methods:
     * The SCI QUERI Research Coordinating Center (RCC) is focusing on the
       following screening tools for retrospective diagnostic yield (and
       ultimately patient outcome) studies in the veterans population of
       persons with SCI:
     * a) electrocardiogram, b) chest x-ray, c) pulmonary function
       screening, d) renal sonogram, e) intravenous pyelogram, f)
       colonoscopy, g) skin integrity screening, h) psychosocial
       assessment, i) rehabilitation functional evaluation, j) cystoscopy,
       and k) albumin levels.
     * These tests were selected to target diseases/issues of high
       morbidity and mortality having critical impact on health and
       satisfaction with life in this population.
     * Survey methodology will be employed to collect information from the
       23 VA SCI Centers about the preventive services selected for study.

   Results:
     * Sites that report a high level of testing and accessible data will
       be identified for potential diagnostic yield studies conducted in
       collaboration with the RCC.
     * These retrospective studies will provide pilot data and research
       direction for SCI medicine, serving as a foundation for the
       prospective, randomized clinical trials needed to build a quality
       evidence base for preventive care in this population.
