   Upcoming Flight Projects Here you will find information about the
   spacecraft that are being developed under the auspices of the Goddard
   Center and the locations of the launches. Included here are both
   unmanned (expendable launch vehicles) and Space Shuttle missions.

   Engineering and Advanced Technology Achievements The Goddard Center is
   right on the edge of the latest engineering and technological research.
   Goddard is a Center of excellence in enabling the transfer of
   technology to corporate America. Find out about our activities,
   achievements, and Commercial Programs .

   Suborbital Research Goddard's Wallops Flight Facility, located on
   Virginia's Eastern Shore, is NASA's primary center for suborbital
   research. NASA personnel build and launch sounding rockets and fly
   scientific balloons and science aircraft worldwide. The facility
   supports NASA, Department of Defense, NOAA, other government agencies,
   universities and industry in flight and science research.

   Orbiting Spacecraft Find out about the spacecraft that are being
   directed by the operations personnel at the Goddard Center. Check out
   the catalogue of spacecraft. We bet there is something here that you
   did not know.
