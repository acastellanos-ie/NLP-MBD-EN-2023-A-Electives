                         NSSL Bibliographic Database
                                   Credits

   Many people have worked on this project, particularly several
   undergraduate and high school students from the Oklahoma City/Norman
   area. The winter weather database was designed and created by Scott
   Blomquist and most of the winter weather references were researched by
   Melissa Hall; both students have attended the Oklahoma School of
   Science and Math. These students worked on this project during the
   summer of 1996, when they were at NSSL participating in the Practical
   Hands-On Application to Science Education (PHASE) program that was
   sponsored by the NOAA/Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. NSSL
   meteorologists from the Mesoscale Applications Group, in particular
   John Cortinas, Ron Holle, and Charlie Crisp, have researched the
   references, entered the data, and developed the web pages. Other staff
   involved with this project include Doug Kennedy from Computer Support
   Services, who provided valuable advice on the database design, and
   Lacey Holland, who helped enter the data.
