   The Physical and Chemical Properties Division is the Nation's reference
   laboratory for measurements, standards, data, and models for:
     * the thermophysical and thermochemical properties of gases, liquids,
       and solids - both pure materials and mixtures
     * the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions in the gas and
       liquid phases
     * fluid-based physical processes and systems, including separations,
       low-temperature refrigeration, and low-temperature heat transfer
       and flow.

   The Physical and Chemical Properties Division is one of five divisions
   in the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory (CSTL) of the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Division
   provides technical research and services, Standard Reference Data,
   Standard Reference Materials, and calibrations to promote U.S. economic
   growth and to assist U.S. industry, other government agencies, and
   academia in solving problems of national importance.

   With research groups in both Gaithersburg, MD and Boulder, CO, the
   Physical and Chemical Properties Division serves several functions. In
   the areas of thermophysics, thermochemistry, and kinetics, the Division
     * develops, maintains, and uses state-of-the-art apparatus to perform
       experimental measurements on industrially and scientifically
       important systems
     * compiles, evaluates, and correlates experimental data
     * develops and evaluates state-of-the-art theories, models,
       estimation methods, and computational approaches
     * disseminates results by a wide variety of mechanisms.

   In the area of cryogenic technologies, the Division provides
   engineering data, models, and research to support the development of
   advanced cryocoolers, and measurement methods, standards, and services
   for flow under cryogenic conditions.
