   Studies have identified the key technology developments needed for TPF.
   For most of these developments, advanced ground and space based
   telescopes and interferometers are currently in operation or under
   development and they will provide this technology heritage for TPF to
   build on.

   These devices and missions may each be accessed on their own web pages.
   Palomar Testbed Interferometer, Keck Interferometer, Large Binocular
   Telescope, Space Infrared Telescope Facility, Space Interferometry
   Mission, DS-3 and the Next Generation Space Telescope.

   Two main items require special additional development, interferometric
   nulling in space, and control of separate spacecraft and formation
   flying. Both of these items have development planned for precursor
   missions and ground observations. Both will also require some special
   development for TPF. NASA plans to fully support the development of TPF
   prior to full scale development.
