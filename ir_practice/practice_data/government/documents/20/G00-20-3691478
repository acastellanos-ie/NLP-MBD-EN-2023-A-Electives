   The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)
   provides third-party accreditation to testing and calibration
   laboratories. NVLAP's accreditation programs are established in
   response to Congressional mandates or administrative actions by the
   Federal Government or from requests by private-sector organizations.
   NVLAP is in full conformance with the standards of the International
   Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International
   Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), including ISO/IEC 17025 and Guide
   58. NVLAP identifies its accredited laboratories in a published
   directory, NIST Special Publication 810, and on this web site,
   Directory of Labs.
