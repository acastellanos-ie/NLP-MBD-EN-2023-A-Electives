   On October 21, 1998, a tropical depression formed in the southern
   Caribbean Sea. One day later, the storm became a tropical storm and was
   given the name "Mitch". Mitch moved very little over the next few days,
   drifting to the northwest, and gathering strength. A sharp increase in
   intensity occurred between the afternoon of October 23 and October 26
   during which time Mitch strengthened from a tropical storm with 60 knot
   winds, to a Saffir-Simpson Category 5 hurricane with winds of 155
   knots.

   The hurricane continued to gather strength as it moved to the northwest
   very slowly. Winds in the storm reached a peak of 157 knots (180 MPH)
   on October 26 just off the northeast coast of Honduras. This made Mitch
   the strongest hurricane in the Caribbean sea in over a decade. Mitch
   maintained this level of intensity for nearly 24 hours before beginning
   to weaken.

   By the morning of October 28, winds associated with Hurricane Mitch had
   decreased to 105 knots. The storm was located just north of Honduras
   and was drifting to the west. By this point, however, the real story
   was not the wind but the rain. The slow movement of the storm had
   caused heavy rain in Central America over the past few days, but
   especially in Honduras and Nicaragua. Now with the storm stalled to the
   north, the rains increased in intensity and coverage. Widespread,
   catastrophic flooding and mudslides were the result. By the time
   Tropical Storm Mitch made landfall on the 29th, the damage and loss of
   life was already extensive.

   Mitch weakened rapidly once it arrived onshore but the mountainous
   regions of Honduras and Nicaragua continued to "squeeze" the moisture
   out of the system. The circulation center began to turn to the north
   and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on November 2. As Mitch began to
   redevelop, it interacted with a cold front that was extending into the
   Gulf. The storm began to increase its forward speed to the
   east-northeast and on November 4, winds associated with the storm
   increased again to tropical storm strength. Mitch was reclassified as a
   tropical storm although much of the wind field was displaced from the
   center, meaning that the storm was losing its tropical characteristics.

   Later on the 4th, Mitch hit the west coast of Florida with winds that
   gusted to near 70 knots. The storm's forward speed had increased to 23
   knots and it cleared Florida later that evening. Once in the Atlantic,
   meteorologists at the Tropical Prediction Center determined that Mitch
   no longer had tropical characteristics and classified the storm as
   "extratropical".

   Satellite images were produced from data received from the
   Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - 8 (GOES - 8) and
   the Polar-orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) NOAA-12 and NOAA-14.
