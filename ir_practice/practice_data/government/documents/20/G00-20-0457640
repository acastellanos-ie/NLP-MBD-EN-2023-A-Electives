   system of 125 parks and a variety of recreation programs, including
   boating, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling. State Parks is governed

   appointed by the governor to staggered six-year terms  who guide and

   offices in Wenatchee (Eastern region), Burlington (Northwest region),

    Quality Improvement

   In 1997 Gov. Gary Locke issued an executive order calling for better
   public service and more efficient operation in all state government
   agencies through the adoption of concepts and procedures known as
   quality improvement methods. At Washington State Parks, this has
   involved surveying employees to identify needed internal improvements;
   establishing employee teams to address issues, improve processes and
   eliminate unnecessary activities; using the best-available data and
   information to guide decisions; involving customers in decision-making;
   open communication; and employee wellbeing.
    Customer service commitment

   Exceptional customer service is part of on-going quality initiatives at
   State Parks. The employees of the Washington State Parks and Recreation
   Commission feel that customer service is essential to the relationship
   with visitors, partners and colleagues.
   The State Parks mission, values and strategic plans all reflect the
   agencys commitment to provide the general public with the most
   enjoyable recreational experience possible and to help them understand
   and appreciate the natural and cultural heritage of Washington State.
   State Parks employees take pride in their friendliness, enthusiasm and
   genuine dedication to their work and to the public they serve.
