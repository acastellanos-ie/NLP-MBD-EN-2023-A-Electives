                           General Plan Extensions

   Background

   California Government Code Section 65361 authorizes the Director of the
   Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to grant "general plan
   extensions" to cities and counties. An extension relieves a city or
   county of the requirement that it adopt a complete and legally adequate
   general plan or, in the case of a new city, that it adopt its plan
   within a specific time period. For counties and most cities an
   extension may apply to any portion of the general plan which is being
   or will be prepared or revised, except the housing element. New cities,
   however, may request an extension for all portions of their general
   plan, including the housing element.

   The grant of an extension temporarily waives state laws requiring
   consistency between local decisions and the portion of a plan subject
   to the extension. This allows local officials to continue acting on
   zoning, subdivisions, and related matters in the absence of a complete
   or adequate general plan. Local government decisions, however, must
   still conform to those provisions of the general plan excluded from the
   extension, to the extent specified by state and local laws. Also, local
   decision makers must comply with any conditions of approval imposed by
   OPR in granting the extension.

   Cities and counties are not required to obtain an extension to complete
   or revise their general plans. In fact, most revisions occur without
   OPR's involvement. At times, however, a general plan extension may
   facilitate the local planning process by allowing the jurisdiction to
   focus its energies on its general plan update without the distraction
   of threats of lawsuit challenging its plan's adequacy.

   OPR's Director may grant an extension of up to two years in duration.
   The Director may grant a second extension, which shall not exceed one
   additional year, if the director determines that an applicant has made
   substantial progress toward completing or revising the covered
   elements. Only one such second extension is allowed by law.

   Section 65361(c) provides that "the director may impose any conditions
   on extensions of time ... that the director deems necessary to ensure
   compliance with the purposes and intent of this title." Conditions
   apply only to those portions of the general plan that are subject to
   the extension. These conditions may affect the city or county's
   subdivision, zoning, use permit, variance, and building permit
   decisions. In addition, they may restrict the approval of general plan
   amendments and development agreements. The particular conditions
   imposed by the Director will depend upon the circumstances of the city
   or county.

   A jurisdiction should contact OPR before its local legislative body
   adopts the resolution of application required under Government Code
   Section 65361(b)(1). Local staff should discuss the application
   requirements, criteria for a complete application, and OPR's processing
   of the extension request prior to filing an extension request. Please
   contact OPR's Planning Unit at (916) 445-0613 for information.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Application Requirements

   An application for a general plan extension must include the five items
   listed below (see also Section 65361(b)).
    1. General Plan Extension Application Form
       The application form is attached to this information packet.
    2. Resolution of the Local Legislative Body
       The request for a general plan extension must include a resolution
       of the local legislative body, adopted after a public hearing. The
       resolution must set forth:

    A. The existing element(s) of the local general plan for which the
       extension is being requested. This may include both required and
       optional elements.
    B. The amount of time needed for preparing and adopting the proposed
       general plan or part(s) thereof. Note that an extension takes
       effect on the date it is granted by OPR's Director, not the date of
       the local legislative body's resolution.
    C. Detailed reasons why the general plan has not been adopted or needs
       revision. These should explain the specific local circumstances
       that have precluded adoption or created the need for revision.
       Pertinent discussion may be appended to the resolution and adopted
       by reference. The reasons must include at least one of the
       following findings from Government Code Section 65361(a), and the
       resolution should specify which of the findings is being made.

    1. Data required for the general plan shall be provided by another
       agency and it has not yet been provided.
    2. In spite of sufficient budgetary provisions and substantial
       recruiting efforts, the city or county has not been able to obtain
       necessary staff or consultant assistance.
    3. A disaster has occurred requiring reassignment of staff for an
       extended period or requiring a complete reevaluation and revision
       of the general plan, or both.
    4. Local review procedures require an extended public review process
       which has resulted in delaying the decision by the legislative
       body.
    5. The city or county is jointly preparing all or part of the general
       plan with one or more other jurisdictions pursuant to an existing
       agreement and timetable for completion.
    6. Other reasons exist which justify the granting of an extension, so
       that the timely preparation and adoption of a general plan is
       promoted.

   Findings should be specific and address the issues at hand. A finding
   is more than a statement of fact; in order for a statement to be a
   legally recognized finding, it must bridge the analytical gap between
   raw data and ultimate conclusion (Topanga Association for a Scenic
   Community vs. County of Los Angeles, 11 Cal.3d 506, 1974). In other
   words, it must explain how the facts relate to the assertion being
   made. Findings may incorporate supporting information by reference.
   Referenced sources must also be included when applying for an
   extension.

   As previously noted, if a city or county is applying for an extension,
   its representatives should consult OPR prior to the adoption of the
   resolution of application. This will help to assure that the contents
   of the resolution meet statutory requirements.

     Detailed Budget and Schedule for Plan Preparation and Adoption

   Each applicant must submit a budget and schedule for the preparation
   and adoption of the general plan element(s) for which an extension is
   sought. The materials should include plans for citizen participation
   and interim action. The detailed budget and schedule must provide for
   adoption of a complete and adequate plan within two years of the date
   of application. The budget and schedule must be sufficiently detailed
   to allow OPR to assess the applicant's progress during the extension.

   The budget should indicate:

    1. The amount of funds allocated to the project.
    2. The allocation of funds among consultant services (if applicable)
       and local staff.

                        The schedule should include:
    1. Major tasks to be undertaken in preparing or revising the general
       plan (e.g., appointment of citizen committees, data collection
       (specify types), formulation of goals and policies).
    2. Projected starting and completion dates for each task.
    3. Identification of individuals responsible for specific tasks (e.g.,
       local planning staff, consultant, other local staff).
    4. Descriptions of and completion dates for major interim products to
       be completed prior to the final document (e.g., technical reports,
       draft plan alternatives).
    5. The anticipated occasions for citizen participation and review,
       planning commission review and approval, and governing body review
       and adoption.
    6. Methods for obtaining citizen participation.

   If you are already working on a general plan element(s) for which your
    city or county is seeking the extension, please briefly describe the
     work to date, and follow the above format for remaining tasks. If a
     consultant is to be used for all or a portion of the work program,
     please submit a copy of the consultant's proposed work program with
               your application or as soon as it is available.

     Proposed Policies and Procedures

   The application must include a set of proposed policies and procedures.
    Their purpose is to suggest possible means by which the jurisdiction
   could ensure that land use decisions made during the extension will not
   interfere with the general plan proposals being considered or studied.

   OPR's Director may use the suggested policies and procedures as a basis
       for the extension conditions of approval or may modify them as
   necessary. Where there is a conflict between the proposed policies and
     the conditions of approval, the Director's conditions will prevail.

      Extension applicants are often at an early stage in the planning
       process. They may not yet have planning studies or sufficiently
      comprehensive general plan drafts. Under these circumstances, the
    policies and procedures should keep local planning options open while
    simultaneously guiding decisions related to rezonings, subdivisions,
       and other land use entitlements under consideration during the
                                 extension.

     Cities or counties that have already prepared planning proposals or
   draft general plan documents should consider using these as a basis for
      their proposed policies and procedures. The extension application
        should include copies of these proposals or draft documents.

      In either case, the policies and procedures should facilitate and
      provide a rationale for land use project evaluations and decision
   making during the extension. These policies and procedures may include
          any planning and regulatory functions authorized by law.

     Additional Materials Required

    In order to evaluate the extension request and determine appropriate
    conditions of approval, the following background materials should be
                       included with the application:
    1. Copies of your jurisdiction's general plan, zoning and subdivision
       ordinances, and any specific plans, area plans, or community plans.
       If a draft general plan has been completed, a copy of that draft.
    2. Copies of documents associated with pending litigation pertaining
       to the general plan, if any.
    3. Copies of any interim ordinances, (e.g., growth management, interim
       zoning).
    4. A list of projects that are currently being processed or that are
       expected to be filed in the near future. This should include
       general plan amendments, rezonings, tentative subdivision maps,
       conditional use permits, planned unit developments, specific plans,
       development agreements, or other similar discretionary actions.
       Building permits and final subdivision maps should not be included
       on this list. Please provide the project name, location, proposal,
       and status.
     __________________________________________________________________

                 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

         The granting of an extension by OPR is not subject to CEQA.
      Nevertheless, CEQA still applies to local government approvals of
   discretionary projects during the extension period, including adoption
          of the general plan element(s) affected by the extension.
     __________________________________________________________________

                        Application Review Procedure

   When OPR receives an extension request, the application is assigned to
   a staff member. The staff member evaluates the application and notifies
   the city or county if additional information is required or if changes
      in the resolution, budget or schedule appear necessary to ensure
                         compliance with state law.

     Subsequent to reviewing the request, OPR's Director will notify the
    extension applicant, in writing, regarding approval of the extension.
       The Director's letter granting the extension will set forth the
    conditions required to ensure compliance with the State Planning and
      Zoning Law. These may include modification of the jurisdiction's
                      proposed policies or procedures.

     OPR fully expects jurisdictions receiving extensions to make steady
     progress on the general plan revision according to their submitted
       schedules. OPR also expects cities and counties to abide by the
                      extension conditions of approval.
     __________________________________________________________________

                           Conditions of Approval

    Government Code Section 65361 empowers the Director of OPR to impose
    those conditions on extensions of time which are necessary to ensure
   compliance with state planning law. The conditions are tailored to the
    particular circumstances of the involved city or county and will vary
                        from extension to extension.

   OPR's further intent in establishing extension conditions is to protect
    the integrity of the plan update process, to the extent possible, by
      preventing a jurisdiction from foreclosing its planning options.
     Although the actual conditions of approval will vary, the following
    examples illustrate the sort of conditions that are commonly applied:
     * The city shall not amend its existing general plan during the
       period of this extension, except as may be necessary to:

    a. Comply with a specific state or federal requirement, such as the
       California Hazardous Waste Management Act.
    b. Revise or implement administrative or impact fees pursuant to the
       California Government Code.

     The city shall neither accept application for, nor consider, any
   development agreement, vesting tentative map, or other agreement which
   vests and legally precludes unilateral changes in land use by the city.

     During this extension, the County shall not initiate or accept
   applications for, process, or adopt any specific plans.

     The city may continue to process and consider those projects which
   were filed prior to the effective date of this extension provided that
   the city shall not approve such applications unless it makes written
   findings, based on substantial evidence in the record, that: (1) the
   project is consistent with the existing general plan, (2) there is a
   reasonable probability the project will be consistent with the proposed
   general plan, and (3) there is little or no probability the project
   will be detrimental to or interfere with the future adopted general
   plan.

     This extension shall not release the City from continuing to comply
   with the requirements of applicable State, federal, and California law
   including the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

    a. The city may approve a discretionary land use project, as defined
       below, only when it makes written findings, based on substantial
       evidence in the record, that: (1) the project is consistent with
       the existing general plan, (2) there is a reasonable probability
       the project will be consistent with the proposed general plan, and
       (3) there is little or no probability the project will be
       detrimental to or interfere with the future adopted general plan.
    b. For the purposes of this extension, "discretionary land use
       project" includes zoning ordinance adoptions or amendments (e.g.,
       rezonings); tentative subdivision and parcel maps; parcel maps for
       which no tentative maps are required; conditional use permits;
       zoning variances; design, site plan, architectural, or historic
       preservation reviews; planned developments; and public
       works/capital improvements projects (except for those projects
       necessary for the maintenance or public health and safety).

   "City" includes the City Council, planning commission, planning
   advisory council, and any County official, commission, committee,
   board, or individual delegated administrative responsibilities under
   city ordinances and policies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Completion of Extended Element(s)

   When the jurisdiction completes the general plan element(s) for which
   an extension has been granted, the legislative resolution adopting the
   element should be submitted to OPR along with a copy of the adopted
   element(s). Submission of an adopted element does not constitute OPR
   endorsement of the element's adequacy. Completion of the elements and
   their adoption terminates the extension.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Second Extensions

   In the event that jurisdiction will not be able to complete a general
   plan or plan element within the authorized extension period, it may
   request a second extension that shall not exceed one year. The
   application process is the same as that for the first extension. That
   is, the jurisdiction's legislative body must adopt a resolution
   requesting a second extension, providing the required findings and
   reasons why additional time is needed. The application must also submit
   another budget and work program, revised if necessary to reflect a new
   schedule of progress during the third year. Further, the application
   must include a set of proposed policies and procedures as described
   previously.

   Before OPR can approve a second extension, the jurisdiction must
   demonstrate that it has made substantial progress toward completion of
   the general plan or plan elements for which the first extension was
   granted. Toward this end, the jurisdiction should include sufficient
   documentation in its second extension application to demonstrate
   substantial progress. Unlike the first extension, approval of a second
   extension is subject to the discretion of the Director of OPR.

   If a jurisdiction needs a second extension, it should contact OPR at
   least four weeks before the first extension expires. The city or county
   should be sure that the length of time it requests for the second
   extension, if less than one year, is adequate to complete the plan
   revision process, because OPR's Director is statutorily prohibited from
   granting an additional extension.
