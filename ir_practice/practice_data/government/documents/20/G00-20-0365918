   Scientists at the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center
   (MARC) develop new technology in order to increase the efficiency of
   livestock production and benefit consumers. The MARC was authorized by
   Congress on June 16, 1964, and development began in the spring of 1966
   on 35,000 acres near Clay Center, Nebraska. Presently, research
   programs are using a female breeding population of 6,500 cattle of 18
   breeds, 3,000 sheep of 10 breeds, and 700 swine litters per year. The
   MARC is administered by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) within
   the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). On October 10,
   1978, President Carter signed into law a bill which renamed the
   research facility after former Senator Roman L. Hruska of Nebraska.
