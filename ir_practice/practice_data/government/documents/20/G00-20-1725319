    Technology Pioneered at Argonne Shows Promise for Next Generation of
                              Nuclear Reactors
           [ebr1_lg-2.jpg] A nuclear reactor technology pioneered
   by Argonne has the potential to provide safe, reliable electricity for
                            generations to come.
    At the same time, it promises to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases
   and other pollutants. Both actinides recovered from spent nuclear fuel
    and weapons plutonium could be used as fuel in such a system, greatly
     reducing proliferation risks and the amount and toxicity of nuclear
     wastes that need long-term isolation from the environment. More...
