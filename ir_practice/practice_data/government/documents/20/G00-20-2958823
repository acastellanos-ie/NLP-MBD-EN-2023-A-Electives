   [sesigns.gif]

   If you would like to get direct e-mail notification of the next Snow
   Emergency, please enter your exact e-mail address below:

   E-mail Address: _______________________________________________________

   After entering your e-mail address above, please choose one of the
   following:

     Subscribe -- To add your e-mail address to the list

     Unsubscribe -- To remove your name from the list

     Verify -- To check if your e-mail address is currently on the list

   NOTE: we have had problems that have allowed users to post to the list.
   If you receive an e-mail that is obviously not a snow emergency notice,
   please disregard the message.

   DO NOT send new e-mails to snowemer@ci.stpaul.mn.us, as this will
   simply complicate the problem. If you have questions or concerns about
   the list, please e-mail domo.owner@ci.stpaul.mn.us, the maintainer of
   the list.

   Please be aware that the list maintainer is on the list as well, so
   they are aware of any errant e-mails that are sent to the list, and are
   actively trying to fix these problems should they occur.

  Important Information about The Snow Emergency Mailing List

     * You will get a response within 24 hours
       We will send out a response to the supplied address to confirm your
       registration. If you don't receive a confirming email, you haven't
       been added to the mailing list, and should reapply.
     * You must respond to the confirmation
       Once you receive the email confirming your address, you must
       respond for us to verify that you did want to be on the mail list.
       This is to make sure that the addressee is the one who requested to
       be added. If you do not respond to the confirmation email, you will
       not be added to the mailing list.
       Important -- respond by simply replying to the sender of the
       confirmation request, or <snowmail@ci.stpaul.mn.us>. Do not send
       e-mail to snowemer@ci.stpaul.mn.us, since this is the list
       itself, and not for public posting.
     * All bounced addresses will be dropped from the mailing list
       If your -mail address is incorrect, or has been changed so that the
       address in our list is no longer accurate, the address will be
       dropped from the list.
     * * In case of technical difficulty -- remember to call
       651-266-PLOW.
       Wed rather you be safe than sorry. We make every effort to provide
       this service reliably. There is the possibility, however, that our
       server -- or even your e-mail server -- may be down and there would
       be no way to get the message to you. If it appears to have snowed
       enough to plow and you have not received an e-mail notification
       from us, please call 651-266-PLOW to find out if a Snow Emergency
       is in effect.

    Please note that you will get e-mail back that you must respond to in
                  order to get the Snow Emergency mailings.
