   FCC Updates and Releases

   The Commission has developed several methods over the past few years to
   help the public keep up with the steady flow of information that is
   added to the FCC web site each day (approximately 50 files added
   daily). This page provides a collection of links that you can use to
   make sure you don't miss any new releases and to keep track of the
   pages that the Commission updates on a regularly scheduled basis.

   Daily Digest

   The Daily Digest provides a brief synopsis of Commission orders, news
   releases, speeches, public notices and all other FCC documents that are
   released each business day. The Daily Digest is released on paper, via
   email and on the FCC Web Site by about 1:30 p.m and contains hypertext
   links to the listed documents.

   Daily Business

   Copies of all Commission documents that are posted on the FCC Web Site
   each day are arranged in Daily Business directories according to date
   to give users quick, centralized access to all new items that are
   posted each day. The Daily Business Files are posted every business day
   by about 2:00pm. Files in the Daily Business directories are copies of
   FCC files located elsewhere within the site, and are only maintained
   for three months.

   FCC Headlines

   The Headlines section in the center of the main FCC Home Page is the
   best source for up-to-the-minute status and links to very latest and
   highest profile items at the Commission, and for other important
   notices. FCC Headlines have been archived since July of 1996, and serve
   as a great chronological resource for tracing the history of the
   Commission's work.

   Ex Parte Presentations

   An Ex Parte Presentation is any presentation which, if written
   (including electronic mail), is not served on the parties to the
   proceeding, or, if oral, is made without advance notice to the parties
   and without opportunity for them to be present. The Office of the
   Secretary issues at least two public notices per week that list the
   presentations that have been received to date. The Commission receives
   an average of 12,000 ex parte presentations each year. The Ex Parte
   page provides a calendar of links to all of these Public Notices.These
   listings also include Post-Reply Comment Period Filings.

   Open Proceedings

   The Consumer Information Bureau produces this weekly Open Proceedings
   News Release that lists current FCC Notices of Proposed Rulemaking and
   Notices of Inquiry that are open for public comment and includes
   pertinent Public Notices announcing comment subjects and dates.

   FCC Calendar of Events

   The Office of Media Relations produces this weekly FCC Calendar of
   Events that lists the times, dates, and locations of upcomming FCC and
   FCC-related events such as Commissioners' speeches, Open Commission
   Meetings, conferences, tutorials, and public forums.

   FCC Filings

   This weekly FCC Filings News Release lists the documents that companies
   and individuals send to the FCC. The types of documents typically
   received are comments, reply comments, petitions, clairifications,
   motions, proposals, and waiver requests.

   FCC Employment Opportunities

   This is a list of vacancy announcements for Employment Opportunities
   within the FCC. Each entry in the list gives a short description of the
   position, salary details, and a link to the full-text version of the
   announcement.

   Open Commission Meetings

   The Commissioners hold a public meeting once a month to consider,
   discuss, and vote on items that are before the Commission. The agenda
   is released a few days before each meeting, and the meeting dates are
   scheduled months in advance. Worldwide access via the Internet to live
   and pre-recorded audio/video broadcasts of these and other FCC events
   is provided through the FCC Internet Audio Broadcast Home Page.

   Biennial Reviews

   The Communications Act requires the Commission to review all of its
   regulations applicable to providers of telecommunications service in
   every even-numbered year, beginning in 1998, to determine whether the
   regulations are still in the public interest. The Commission determined
   that this first biennial regulatory review presented an excellent
   opportunity for a serious top-to-bottom examination of all of the
   Commission's regulations, not just those statutorily required to be
   reviewed, and has since made significant progress on the 31 proceedings
   which it proposed that the Commission initiate as part of the review.

   Audit Plans & Reports

   The Office of Inspector General conducts and supervises audits and
   investigations relating to the programs and operations of the FCC. This
   page provides an Annual Audit Plan that identifies the Commission
   programs and operations that have been scheduled for audit during the
   upcoming year, as well as semi-annual progress reports on the audits
   and special review reports that have been initiated.

   FCC Fees

   Congress authorizes the FCC to impose and collect application
   processing fees and directs the Commission to prescribe charges for
   certain types of application processing or authorization services it
   provides to communications entities over which it has jurisdiction and
   to recover the annual costs of its enforcement, policy and rulemaking,
   user information, and international activities. The Schedule of Fees is
   revised annually and establishes regulatory fees in the Common Carrier,
   Commercial Wireless, Mass Media, Cable Television and International
   services.

   En Banc Presentations

   En Banc Presentations are Periodic presentations to the five FCC
   Commissioners on various communications policy issues which are
   intended to educate and inform the Commissioners, FCC staff, and the
   public about differing perspectives on current issues in
   telecommunications policy. Topics include: Spectrum Management, Local
   Television Ownership Rules ,Telecom Mergers, Affordability of
   Telecommunications Services, Bandwidth, Universal Service, Local
   Telephone Competition, and Multichannel Video Industry Competition.
