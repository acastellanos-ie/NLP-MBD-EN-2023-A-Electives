                               ITAR Compliance
     __________________________________________________________________


   The U.S. Export control laws (International Traffic In Arms Regulation
   (ITAR)), Code of Federal Regulation, Title 22 disallows the
   export/release of the technical data contained on this Private Web Site
   to Foreign Nationals/Non US citizens. Thus, access to this Private Web
   Site is password protected. Unauthorized release of ITAR controlled
   technical data subjects the releaser to heavy penalties (fines and/or
   imprisonment) and could jeopardize the Agency's current export
   privileges.

   Questions should be directed to Thai Pham, Wide Field Camera 3 Project
