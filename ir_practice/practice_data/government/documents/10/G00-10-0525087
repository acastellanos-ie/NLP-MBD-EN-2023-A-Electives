                            Welcome to our site.

   The Collaboration for Environmental Research In the North-East (CERINE)
   provides real-time and diagnostic environmental data covering a wide
   area of the eastern United States.

   In early January 2000, CERINE acquired a polar-orbiting satellite
   receiving station through a collaboration between scientists from the
   State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook and from Brookhaven
   National Laboratory (BNL). [sstmid.jpg] This station is intended to
   provide observational support for local scientific fieldwork as well as
   augment local coastal atmospheric and ocean modeling studies. In
   addition, the receiving system and associated observations provide a
   valuable hands-on experience and data resource for students in the
   Marine, Atmospheric and Environmental Programs at SUNY Stony Brook as
   well as those involved in BNL's educational outreach programs.

   CERINE partners include scientists at the Marine Science Research
   Center at SUNY and the Environmental Sciences Department at BNL.
   Support for the satellite station came from a SUNY-BNL Presidential
   Mini-Grant, NY State GRI Equipment Matching Funds, BNL's Environmental
   Sciences Department and Office of Educational Programs , and the Marine
   Science Research Center at SUNY.
