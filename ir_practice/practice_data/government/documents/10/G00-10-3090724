   Exploring Mars: Blowing in the Wind

   One answer to roving across the surface of Mars may be blowing in the
   wind. Literally.

   Researchers exploring different methods to deliver scientific
   instruments to various Martian locales are studying the potential for a
   giant, lightweight, two-story tall beach ball. Equipped with scientific
   instruments, the so-called "tumbleweed ball" conceived by JPL
   researchers, could potentially explore vast tracts of planetary
   terrain, blown by the wind. Read more...

   On Mars, a 6-meter diameter ball could be used for descent (replacing
   the parachute), landing (replacing the airbag), and mobility
   (wind-driven on surface).

   at work on Mars. Behind the Scenes Dr. Ken Edgett, a staff scientist at
   Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, Calif., regularly tracks the
   dust devils and other surface features on Mars.
