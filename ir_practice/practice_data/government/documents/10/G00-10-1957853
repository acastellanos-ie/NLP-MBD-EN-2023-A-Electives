           NAL's Specialized Agricultural Classification Projects
     __________________________________________________________________

   This home page provides access to the National Agricultural Library's
   (NAL) ongoing efforts to construct specialized thesauri and
   classification schemes that meet the needs of various programs and
   projects in the Agricultural Research Service and other collaborating
   USDA agencies. Unless otherwise stated, these projects are still under
   development and are routinely modified and updated.

   Note: The NAL Agricultural Classification Prototype and the Food Safety
   Thesaurus are no longer available as separate thesauri. The content of
   these thesauri is now contained in the NAL Agricultural Thesaurus.
