  Hello crawler.dlib.vt.edu!

     Photos My name Sergey Stepanov. I am a Research Associate Professor
     of Physics at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and a Beamline
     Scientist of the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT) at the
     Advanced Photon Source (APS), a 7 GeV synchrotron located at the
     Argonne National Lab (ANL) near Chicago. For more information about me
     including the Curriculum Vitae, contact info and scientific
     publications please check my official page at the BioCAT Web Server.

     This site provides online access to some of x-ray data analysis
     programs which I developed for x-ray diffraction and scattering studies
     of materials. These programs are based on my own original algorithms
     published in the papers referred below and resulted from analyzing real
     experimental data. The idea of making this software accessible via WWW
     is to have the feedback from colleagues worldwide which can help to
     improve the algorithms and make them more robust and generic. So far
     this has worked very efficiently for common benefit and everyone using
     this site is encouraged to submit his questions, suggestions and
     comments.

   X0h on the Web X0h on the Web interpolates dielectric susceptibilities
   x[0] and x[h] for some crystals and other materials in wide range of
   x-ray wavelengths with the option to compare the data from different
   databases [12]. NEW: Bragg planes search tool.  19107
   calls
   GID_sl on the Web GID_SL on the Web calculates x-ray diffraction curves
   of strained crystals and multilayers for any Bragg-case diffraction
   with scans around arbitrary axis. It can be used for usual symmetric
   and asymmetric diffraction, for extremely asymmetric diffraction, as
   well as for grazing incidence and other non-coplanar cases [16], [19],
   [20], [21], [31]. NEW: simplified interfaces.  6944
   calls
   TER_sl on the Web TER_SL on the Web calculates x-ray specular
   reflection from multilayers with interface roughness and transition
   layers [31], [20].  4198
   calls
   TRDS_sl on the Web TRDS_SL on the Web calculates x-ray diffuse
   scattering from interface roughness. It implements several different
   models of roughness and can calculate such effects as skew roughness
   transfer, dependence of interface-interface roughness correlations on
   lateral size of roughness and x-ray scattering from atomic steps [23],
   [24], [26], [29], [32].  2260
   calls
