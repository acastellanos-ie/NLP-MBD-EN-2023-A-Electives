   San Francisco Bay Bathymetry Web Site

   On this web site we provide location-depth grids of the most recent
   bathymetry available for San Francisco Bay and some tools for examining
   those grids.

   The site features zTool, an online tool for examining a bathymetry data
   set. You can display a cross-section profile, and compute volume above
   and below the section. Using the polygon tool you can compute the
   volume of an outlined polygon at various tide levels.

   Study bathymetric change by running the cool animations in the "Change"
   section.

   Come and explore the depths of SF Bay...
