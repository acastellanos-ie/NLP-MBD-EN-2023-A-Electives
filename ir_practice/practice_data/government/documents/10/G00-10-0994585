   Gold-Gold Ion Collision at PHOBOS at highest RHIC energies: 100 GeV/nucleon

      A spectacular Gold-Gold collision at the maximum RHIC energy as seen by
      Phobos. Phobos consists of a cylindrical array of silicon detectors and
      two spectrometer arms surrounding the interaction region where the gold
      nuclei collide. The colored dots show the locations where silicon was
      struck by the thousands of produced particles. The red lines are
      reconstructed trajectories of some of those particles. The precise
      location where the nuclei collided can clearly be seen.

   Counting charged particles: Average number of charged particles per
   nucleon, measured at about 90 degrees to the beam direction, as a
   function of center of mass of colliding ions.
