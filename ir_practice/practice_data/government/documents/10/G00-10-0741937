                  DECEMBER STREAMFLOWS MOSTLY BELOW NORMAL,
                          RESERVOIR STORAGE VARIES

   During the month of December, eight long-term U.S. Geological Survey
   gaging stations had monthly mean streamflow in the below normal range:
   Yaak River near Troy, Blackfoot River near Bonner, Clark Fork at St.
   Regis, Middle Fork Flathead River near West Glacier, Rock Creek below
   Horse Creek, near International Boundary, Yellowstone River at Corwin
   Springs, and the Yellowstone River at Billings.

   Reservoir storage for December was in the normal range for five out of
   six major hydroelectric reservoirs in Montana--Canyon Ferry Lake,
   Bighorn Lake, Lake Koocanusa, Hungry Horse Reservoir, and Flathead
   Lake. Fort Peck Lake remained below average.

   Four major irrigation reservoirs, Lima, Clark Canyon, Gibson, and
   Fresno Reservoirs, remained below normal storage for the month of
   December.

   The following summary lists preliminary streamflow and reservoir data
   and long-term-average values for purposes of comparison.
