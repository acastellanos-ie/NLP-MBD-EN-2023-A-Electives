   Dear Friend,

   Thank you for visiting my on-line office and happy New Year!

   As we begin the Second Session of the 107th Congress, my colleagues and
   I will be working hard to promote economic growth and fiscal
   responsibility. We must also do everything we can to help New York
   recover and rebuild in the wake of September 11. That includes aiding
   all the victims and their families, and doing more to protect our
   northern border, nuclear power plants, airports and communities.

   Congress will continue to work on legislation to protect our
   environment, improve our schools and expand health care. Bioterrorism,
   energy and agriculture bills are also on our agenda. And we will
   prepare a budget and make appropriations that I hope can spur job
   creation and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers and
   Americans.

   Please let me hear from you about your views on these and other issues
   that matter to your family and community.

   Again, my best wishes for a safe and peaceful 2002!

                                 Sincerely,

                                                             Senator
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's Signature

   Although mail delivery to the United States Capitol offices has
   resumed, the delivery process is still very slow and not yet back to
   normal. It is very important to me to hear from my constituents and I
   hope that you will not hesitate to share your thoughts and concerns
   with me. Until the mail process is more timely, the best way to contact
   me or my Washington, DC staff remains either by fax at (202) 228-0282,
   phone at (202) 224-4451 or by email. Mail for my New York City office
   should be addressed to Suite 2601, 780 Third Avenue, NYC 10017. You may
   also fax (212) 688-7444 or call (212) 688-6262.
