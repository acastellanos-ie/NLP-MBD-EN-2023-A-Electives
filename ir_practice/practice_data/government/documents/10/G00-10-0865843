                                                             Introduction

                                In early 1975, the FBI assigned a handful of employees the task of
   handling an anticipated influx of Freedom of Information Act requests
   due to new legislation. Although the Freedom of Information Act had
   been in effect since 1967, it did not apply to investigatory files
   compiled for law enforcement purposes, thus generally exempting FBI
   files from public access.

   By the end of 1975, amendments to the Freedom of Information Act had
   become effective and the Privacy Act of 1974 also became effective. The
   passage of these laws provided for broad access to FBI records which
   previously had been severely limited.

   The task of responding to these Freedom of Information-Privacy Acts
   (FOIPA) requests became a very large one indeed. Some single requests
   have resulted in the processing of thousands of pages of records. In
   very simple terms, when a request is received it is logged into a
   computer and assigned a number for tracking purposes; it is
   acknowledged; an indices search is conducted to determine if the FBI
   has responsive records; and the file(s) is located and reviewed to
   determine if it is fact "ident" or the correct file.

   Once a file has been identified as being responsive to a request, it is
   photocopied, and the work copy is reviewed by an analyst to determine
   if any portions should be withheld from the requester under any various
   exemptions permitted by the FOIPA. The analyst uses a colored marker to
   delete any exempt material, writes in the margins the particular
   exemption cited, and has the work copy re-copied using a photocopier
   with a special filter. The portions that appeared in translucent color
   on the work copy are black on the release copy. The release copy is
   mailed to the requester upon receipt of payment of fees, if applicable.

   This labor intensive process has been repeated thousands of times since
   1975. In the past twenty plus years, the FBI has handled over 300,000
   requests and over six million pages of FBI documents have been released
   to the public in paper format. Currently, an automated document
   processing system is under development that will replace the "marker
   pen" method and allow for documents to be released in electronic
   format.

   For the FOIPA Section web page, we have selected several FBI cases
   which may be of interest to the public. These documents also appear in
   paper form in our traditional reading room in Washington, D.C. As time
   and resources permit, additional cases will be created in electronic
   format and placed on the web site for public viewing.
