   The research in the group of Dr. Salmeron is centered on the nanometer
   scale mechanical, chemical and physical properties of surfaces and
   interfaces. The main topics include:
     * manipulation of matter at the atomic scale,
     * studies of friction, adhesion and wear in contacts of nanometer
       dimensions between a sharp tip and a surface,
     * nanometer scale structure of liquid films during wetting and
       corrosion, and
     * catalytic and chemical properties of surfaces.

   Individual atoms and molecules are manipulated with the help of a
   scanning tunneling microscope (STM) that operates at cryogenic
   temperatures (~20-30 K). Manipulation consists of moving atoms from one
   position to another, dissociation and association of molecules. The
   manipulation mechanism used includes electronic, vibrational and
   rotational excitation of molecules by means of electrons injected from
   the sharp STM tip. Our goal is to understand the basic science behind
   these processes.

   Friction, adhesion and wear in contacts that involve a finite number of
   atoms and molecules (from tens to thousands) are studied using atomic
   force microscopes. The experiments are aimed at understanding the
   mechanisms of energy dissipation and wear. Systems studied include
   organic monolayers that are model lubricants, for example,
   self-assembled monolayers of alkylthiols, alkylsilanes and others.
   Inorganic monolayers of carbon, sulfur, oxygen, etc. on metal surfaces
   are also studied.

   We study the structure of liquids at the nanometer scale, in thin films
   and droplets. Our goal is to study at the molecular level the phenomena
   of wetting (spreading of a liquid on a surface), corrosion and
   lubrication. The studies are performed with the help of atomic force
   microscopes (AFM) that operate in a non-contact mode, so that the sharp
   tip does not perturb the liquid surface. Other studies are performed
   using spectroscopic methods, such as vibrational and photoelectron
   spectroscopy. We recently built a unique environmental chamber to
   perform X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at the Berkeley Lab
   Synchrotron. This chamber allows us, for the first time, to perform
   experiments in normal ambient conditions of pressure and temperature.

   Catalysis and surface chemistry involve the determination of the
   adsorption geometry of atoms and molecules on catalyst surfaces, and
   their reaction pathways. STMs are used in vacuum and under high
   pressure to provide atomically resolved images of the surfaces.
