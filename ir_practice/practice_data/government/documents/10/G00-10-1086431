   INEEL, DOE unveil project to better focus research on water issues

   The U.S. Department of Energy and its Idaho National Engineering and
   Environmental Laboratory have initiated a project to better focus
   research on water issues at the INEEL.The goal of the project is to
   bring together all the different resources and projects that deal with
   water issues at the INEEL so they are more efficiently applied to the
   task of protecting the Snake River Plain Aquifer for the long term.
   "Our goal is to apply the best science available when answering the
   question: How do we protect the aquifer? " said Mark Frei, acting
   manager of DOE's Idaho Operations Office. "Right now, we have
   scientists and resources allocated to addressing different pieces of
   that question. The water integration project is aimed at sharing
   information and resources so that the needed science is available when
   we make our cleanup decisions. I have seen the Hanford Site in
   Washington state establish and utilize a similar project successfully
   there; it is time for the INEEL site to adopt such an approach."
   The water integration project is an effort that will identify the gaps
   in science and data that must be filled before multi-billion dollar
   decisions are made on how to best protect the aquifer. The project will
   then coordinate the plans to ensure that information is developed and
   collected cost effectively in a time frame to support the cleanup
   decisions. This project includes surface water on the site, the vadose
   zone (that area between the surface and the aquifer), and the aquifer
   itself.
   Members of the public are invited to participate in the process,
   including developing the design for public involvement. A team
   including DOE-Idaho, the INEEL, and members of the public will jointly
   develop a public participation plan. Members of the public who are
   interested in serving on this team should contact Brad Bugger,
   DOE-Idaho public involvement coordinator, at (208) 526-0833 for
   information on how to participate. The current plan is for the team to
   meet in mid-February in Twin Falls, with a final stakeholder
   involvement plan approved and in place by Feb. 28.
   Members of the public are also invited to sit in on the water
   integration project team meetings each Wednesday at 1 p.m. The meetings
   will be held at the ID North Building on Energy Drive in Idaho Falls.
   Because escort is required in the ID North Building, members of the
   public who plan to attend should let Bugger know in advance of the
   meeting, so they can be badged and escorted to the meetings. Those
   members of the public who cannot attend the meetings in person can call
   in at (208) 526-0683 to listen to the proceedings. The next meeting
   will be held Jan. 30, 2002.
