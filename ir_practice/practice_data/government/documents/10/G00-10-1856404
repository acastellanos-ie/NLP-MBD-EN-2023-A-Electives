This place is special....

   Picture yourself over 100 miles from land, in the middle of the Gulf of
   Mexico.  At times, the seas can be very unforgiving, and the weather
   can turn foul in an instant. But here, in the midst of this
   unpredictable Gulf, lie three of the most beautiful and wild places in
   all the world.  Manta rays, whale sharks, coral heads that are bigger
   than cars, hundreds of species of fish and invertebrates...

                         This place teems with life!
