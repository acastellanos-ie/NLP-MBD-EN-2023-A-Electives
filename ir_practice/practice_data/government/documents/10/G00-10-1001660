                         Welcome  to the California
                             Board of Pharmacy!

   Although prescription drugs can save lives, they can also be dangerous
   if taken improperly. For that reason, the California State Board of
   Pharmacy was established in 1891 to protect consumers by licensing and
   regulating those responsible for dispensing medications to the public.

   From the days when pharmacists often functioned as "doctor/pharmacist"
   and frequently filled orders for drugs scribbled on torn pieces of
   paper, then ground and blended the drugs with a mortar and pestle,
   pharmacy has evolved into a high-tech, computerized dispensing
   practice.

   Today, all aspects of the practice of pharmacy are regulated by the
   Board: the practitioner (the pharmacist), the practice site (the
   pharmacy), and the product (prescription drugs and devices). Even drug
   manufacturers and wholesalers are regulated. Presently, there are more
   than 70,000 individuals and firms licensed through 11 complex and
   varied regulatory programs.
   The Board's primary mission is to promote and protect the public's
   health and safety and ensure that consultation and information is
   provided to patients and other health care providers about drug
   therapy. The Board also ensures that drugs are dispensed and used
   correctly and requires that pharmaceutical therapy is provided by
   highly educated and trained pharmacists who meet the professional
   standards set by the Board. Further, the Board enforces both state and
   federal pharmacy statutes requiring competent, efficient, and ethical
   pharmacy practice.
