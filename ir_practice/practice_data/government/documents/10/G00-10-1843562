   In this component project of the Energy and Environmental Technology
   Applications Program, the Center for Advanced Computer Studies at the
   University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette), and the USGS
   National Wetlands Research Center (NWRC) build on their scientific
   expertise and facilities to develop state-of-the-art digital
   information management and analysis technologies to support energy and
   environmental issues.

   This research is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's
   information management group, the Office of Scientific and Technical
   Information (OSTI).

   The project centers around the development of a comprehensive Energy &
   Environmental Information Resources (EE-IR) Center, which will focus on
   information resources of interest to the Gulf Coast region. In addition
   to those maintained locally, clients will also be provided access to
   information resources created by organizations such as the National
   Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII).

   The EE-IR Center benefits users by capturing and organizing the
   knowledge and experience of environmental research librarians, by
   creating metadata to locate appropriate information sources, and by
   providing software tools and infrastructure to transparently search and
   process data within databases.

   The development of the EE-IR Center complements and supports the
   activities of the NASA/USL Regional Application Center recently
   established at UL Lafayette. The funding provided for this project
   will, in part, enhance the computing resources of the RAC. Furthermore,
   the research and development carried out relative to EE-IR Center will
   further extend the capabilities of the NASA/RAC to search, distribute
   and add value to NASA data sets.

   "To support the developmental activities, basic and applied research
   will be carried out in areas such as multimedia indexing and retrieval,
   database mining, media technology, parallel and distributed computing,
   and data visualization."
