   Two people who work in my Washington, D.C. office have tested positive
   for exposure to the Anthrax bacteria. As a precaution, the United
   States Capitol Attending Physician, in consultation with the Center for
   Disease Control, has recommended that everyone who was on the fifth or
   sixth floors in the southeast corner of the Hart Senate Office Building
   on Monday take the full 60-day regimen of the antibiotic Cipro. This
   includes 26 people who were working in my office on Monday. The two
   people in my office who have tested positive have told me that they are
   doing fine and appreciate the concern that has been expressed by so
   many.

   Senate authorities have closed the Hart Senate Office Building so that
   the entire building can be examined. My Washington office, which is
   located in the Hart Building, will be closed until this process is
   complete. My State offices continue to be open and available to help
   the people of Wisconsin. The phone numbers for my state offices are:
   Middleton (608) 828-1200
   Milwaukee (414) 276-7282
   Wausau (715) 848-5660
   La Crosse (608) 782-5585
   Green Bay (920) 465-7508
