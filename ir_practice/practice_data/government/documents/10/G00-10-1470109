   "The DDF is a special program intended to support the imaginative ideas
       of the people at our Center. It is one of NASA's most visionary
   programs and intended to lay the foundations of the future. Many clever
   inspirations that were started with this 'seed money' have turned into
                fully developed research or flight projects"

                      -Al V. Diaz, GSFC Center Director
