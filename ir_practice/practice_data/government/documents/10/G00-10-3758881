            second meeting in Tokyo, Japan on January 23, 2002. New,
            January 27, 2002.
          + A technical evaluation is now underway in the U.S.science
            community to determine the benefits and costs of FIRE, ITER
            and IGNITOR as a possible next step burning plasma experiment
            consistent with FESAC (284kB, pdf) recommendations and HR4 .
            New, January 20, 2002.
          + The proposed Japanese fusion research budget for JAFY 2002
            (April 2002 - April 2003) has significant reductions for major
            ongoing research projects. The budget of JT60U, Japan's
            largest tokamak, would be reduced by 50% allowing only 4 weeks
            of experiments in JAFY2002. The world's largest stellarator,
            LHD, would have its budget reduced by nearly 30%,
            significantly impacting experimental activities. The decision
            on Japan participation in ITER construction is under debate at
            the highest levels of the government. New, January 14, 2002.
          + The European Council of Research Ministers met on December 10,

            reduced from 788 mioEuros in the 5th Framework to 750 mioEuros
            in the 6th Framework. Language in a previous proposal for the
            Sixth Framework that required 200 mioEuros to be spent on the
            ITER Project has been removed, now 100 mioEuros are to be
            spent on ITER relevant research. New, January 10, 2002.

       energy sciences program, and will provide crucial community input
       to the long range planning activities undertaken by the DOE and the
       FESAC. It will be an ideal place for a broad community of
       scientists to examine goals and proposed initiatives in burning
       plasma science in magnetic fusion energy and integrated research
       experiments in inertial fusion energy. This meeting is open to

       that ended July, 1998.
     * On July 18, the House Science Committee passed H.R. 2460 ( 195 kB
       pdf), which is planned to become part of a larger energy-related
       authorization bill. The House Science Committee bill includes the
       "Fusion Energy Sciences Act of 2001," which was previously
       introduced by Representatives Lofgren, Cunningham and Holt, among
       others (see below). It includes some additional language, based on
       the recent NAS/NRC report, calling for the establishment of new
       "Centers of Excellence," and asking for the NSF to become engaged
       in "extending the reach of fusion science. The bill explicitly
       calls for DOE to prepare "a plan for United States construction of
       a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment for the purpose of
       accelerating scientific understanding of fusion plasmas." The plan
       is to be reviewed by the National Academy of Science and presented
       to Congress by July 1, 2004.
     * House Appropriations Subcommittee approves FY02 Energy and Water
       Development Budget . The FY02 Fusion Energy Sciences budget is

       the construction of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) as
       requested and $25 M for the development of high average power
       lasers from the Defence Programs budget. The Senate Subcommittee on
       Energy and Water Development is expected to mark up in mid-July.

       this afternoon to announce a Fusion Energy Bill. The legislation,
       Fusion Energy Sciences Act of 2001 , would provide for a roadmap
       for a burning plasma experiment, the first step to a commercially
       viable fusion energy power plant. The bill would also call for
       increased federal support for fusion energy research. More
       information can be found at the websites for Congresswoman Zoe
       Lofgren and at Congressman Randy Cunningham . May 9, 2001.

       Center and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found a direct
       connection between emissions of greenhouse gases and warming of the
       oceans. The models used to predict future warming succeeded in
       getting past ocean warming right, over a 50 year period. Not many
       studies have passed such a test.

  Fusion Ignition Research Experiment (FIRE) Physics and Program Information

   The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board(SEAB) Task Force on Fusion
   Energy review of the U. S. fusion program noted that "A necessary next
   major scientific step is the exploration of the physics of a burning
   plasma. At the present time only the tokamak is sufficiently advanced
   as to assure the necessary confinement in such an experiment." The
   National Research Council Assessment of Fusion Science(FuSAC) Interim
   Report identified several critical unresolved fusion science issues:
   (1) turbulence and transport, (2) energy density limits and (3)
   integrated physics of self-heated plasmas. The goal of FIRE is to
   address the critical scientific issues of a magnetically confined
   fusion plasma identified by SEAB and FuSAC within the next decade using
   the most cost-effective approach. Success in FIRE would serve as a
   "Stepping Stone" to provide the scientific foundation needed for an
   attractive fusion energy source as envisioned by the Advanced Reactor
   Innovation Evaluation Study (ARIES) . FIRE welcomes your input on the
   Next Major Step in Magnetic Fusion Research. If you are interested in
   setting up a FIRE discussion session, please send email to

  Laboratories to explore, explain and expand the frontiers of plasma physics
  and fusion science.

   Laboratories on the frontier of fusion and plasma science for the 21st
   century include the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) exploring the
   structure within the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372) , after the December 1999
   servicing mission; the X-ray telescope (Chandra) witnessing the
   Cassiopeia A supernova remnant and a distant quasar, and the dynamo
   driving the ring of fire around the pulsar in the heart of the Crab
   Nebula (lower right); the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
   radiotelescope image of an extragalactic jet confined by a magnetic
   field near the accretion disk of a black hole. The National Ignition
   Facility (NIF) is under construction and will study fusion self-heating
   in a small pellet imploded by intense laser beams. The Next Step Option
   (NSO) is a design study in the U. S. to evaluate potential major next
   steps in magnetic fusion. The U. S.House of Representatives recently
   passed the bill,Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001 which
   calls for DOE to submit a plan by July, 2004 to Congress for
   construction of a U.S. burning plasma experiment. The Fusion Ignition
