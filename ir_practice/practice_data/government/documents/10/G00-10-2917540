   Updated: Wednesday, January 30, 2002 at 11:28 AM EDT

   The OTS is the primary regulator of all federal and many
   state-chartered thrift institutions, which include savings banks and
   savings and loan associations. The OTS was established as an office of
   the Department of the Treasury on August 9, 1989. The OTS has five
   regional offices located in Jersey City, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and
   San Francisco.  Its expenses are funded by assessments and fees levied
   on the institutions it regulates. This Web site provides access to
   information on the agency's programs and activities. We hope you find
   the material informative and helpful.
