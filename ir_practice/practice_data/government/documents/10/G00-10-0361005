                                   Purpose

   This corrosion web site was developed to inform and educate the public
   on issues involving environmental deterioration of materials.  The site
   includes information and pictures of the corrosion engineering,
   research, and testing capabilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC).
   This virtual tour includes information about our Corrosion Laboratories
   detailing efforts at the Beach Corrosion Test Site and the Coating
   Application Laboratory.   A brochure about our KSC Beach Corrosion Test
   Site has been published and is made available for review.  Our
   protective coatings evaluation programs are discussed.  An educational
   look at the various forms of corrosion, with accompanying photography,
   is provided.  Technical and scientific publications are made available
   as well.  Also provided is a photo archive showing many views of the
   facilities as well as "corrosion in action."  For those parties
   interested in doing business with our laboratories, contact information
   is provided.

                                Introduction

   Kennedy Space Center’s launch facilities are located within 1000 feet
   of the Atlantic Ocean.  Salt from the ocean combined with the launch
   vehicles’ acidic rocket exhaust make corrosion protection a high
   priority.  For these reasons, KSC maintains state-of-the-art corrosion
   research and testing capabilities.   Our Beach Corrosion Test Site has
   been documented as having higher atmospheric corrosion rates than any
   other test site in the United States.

                                                                   Shuttle Launch

   The Corrosion Technology Testbed is a department of KSC’s Labs and
   Testbeds Division and any project involving corrosion may utilize this
   fully staffed science laboratory as a resource.  The division includes
   complete laboratories specializing in metallurgical failure analysis,
   physical testing, and microchemical analysis.
