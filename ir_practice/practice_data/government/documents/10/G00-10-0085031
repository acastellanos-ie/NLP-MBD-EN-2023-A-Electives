                    Marine Modeling and Analysis Programs

   MMAP is a subsection of the Coast Survey Development Laboratory within
                         the Office of Coast Survey.

   Marine Modeling and Analysis Programs (MMAP) develops, improves and
   applies analytical methods and numerical techniques for the analysis,
   simulation and real-time forecasting of oceanographic (e.g. water
   levels, currents, temperature, salinity), atmospheric (e.g. winds, sea
   level pressure, temperature, relative humidity) and water quality (e.g.
   dissolved oxygen, nutrients, sediment transport) parameters in support
   of the National Ocean Service mission of providing accurate information
   on these variables for U.S. estuarine and coastal marine areas.
   Oceanographic systems developed in MMAP are used to provide products
   and services for the coastal marine community in support of safe and
   efficient navigation and for environmentally sound utilization,
   management, and protection of the coastal zone.

   MMAP programs fall into three categories
   :

   I. Estuarine and Port Modeling and Forecasting
