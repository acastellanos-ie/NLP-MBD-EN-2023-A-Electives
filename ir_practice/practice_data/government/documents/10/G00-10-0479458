                         New Motor Vehicle Board image

                   Welcome to the New Motor Vehicle Board




     The New Motor Vehicle Board (Board) is a program within the Department
     of Motor Vehicles (Department or DMV) with oversight provided by
     Business, Transportation & Housing Agency (Agency). Maria
     Contreras-Sweet is the Agency Secretary, and Steven Gourley is the
     Director of the Department.

     Created in 1967 as the New Car Dealers Policy and Appeals Board, the
     Board's function was limited to hearing appeals from final decisions of
     the Director of the Department which were adverse to the occupational
     license of a new motor vehicle dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or
     representative. In 1973, the Legislature passed the California
     Automobile Franchise Act (Stats. 1973, ch. 996, sec. 1, p. 2) giving
     the Board its present name and creating a broad statutory framework and
     forum for regulating and settling disputes in the new vehicle industry.

     Within the Board, there is a legal department which operates in a
     quasi-judicial capacity to resolve disputes between franchised dealers
     and manufacturers/distributors of new motor vehicles (including
     motorcycles). Additionally, there is a Consumer Mediation Services
     Program which attempts through informal mediation to resolve disputes
     between consumers and new motor vehicle dealers and/or a manufacturer
     or distributor.
