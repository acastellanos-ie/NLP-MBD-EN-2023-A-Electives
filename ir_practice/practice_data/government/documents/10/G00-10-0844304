Quantitative Evaluation of Contamination Consequences (QECC)

                              green diamond bar

   The goal of the Quantitative Evaluation of Contamination Consequences
   (QECC) project is to quantitatively relate workplace surface and
   airborne contamination levels, both radioactive and chemical, to
   intakes and doses. QECC is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy
   (DOE). QECC is part of the Environment, Safety, and Health Systems
   product line at PNNL.
   Objectives of the project are to
     * quantify available information that relates surface and volume
       contamination of equipment and materials to intakes, and therefore,
       health risks to workers, and
     * quantify how well air sampling predicts worker intakes and what
       factors improve or degrade the usefulness of air sampling to manage
       worker risks.

   The central thrust is building collection of relevant quantitative
   information from case histories in the scientific literature, personal
   files, and incident reports from national and international sources.

     * Background
     * Outcome Measures
     * Computer Modeling Codes for Chemical and Radiological Releases
     * Uses of ANSI/HPS N13.12-1999, "Surface and Volume Radioactivity
       Standards for Clearance"and Comparison with Existing Standards. The
       objectives of this report are:
          + to identify potential uses for the standard above and beyond
            those in the standard itself
          + to make recommendations concerning these potential uses.

       lognormal distribution from minimal summary data. It runs under
       DOS, Windows 95, and Windows 98.

       Pacific Northwest Laboratory, June 3, 1994. This document was the
       foundation for the QECC concept, and contains two outcome measures
       that are found in QECC: time-and-proximity factor, and
       fraction-taken-in.
