        Caring for veterans is not a partisan issue, it is a national
                            obligation. . . They
     served their country with courage, skill and strength, and must now
                                  know that
   they can rely upon us. I pledge to our veterans and to every American,
                                   we will
     not stop until we have done all we can do to care for our Gulf War
                                  veterans.

   President Bill Clinton
