                                  NIST WebBook

Welcome to the NIST WebBook

  A gateway to the data collections of the National Institute of Standards and
  Technology

   The NIST WebBook will provide access to the full array of data compiled
   and distributed by NIST under the Standard Reference Data Program.

   The NIST Chemistry WebBook contains:
     * Thermochemical data for over 6000 organic and small inorganic
       compounds:
          + Enthalpy of formation
          + Enthalpy of combustion
          + Heat capacity
          + Entropy
          + Phase transition enthalpies and temperatures
          + Vapor pressure

     * Reaction thermochemistry data for over 9000 reactions.
          + Enthalpy of reaction
          + Free energy of reaction

     * IR spectra for over 8700 compounds.

     * Mass spectra for over 12,000 compounds.

     * UV/Vis spectra for over 400 compounds.

     * Electronic and vibrational spectra for over 4000 compounds.

     * Constants of diatomic molecules (spectroscopic data) for over 600
       compounds.

     * Ion energetics data for over 16,000 compounds:
          + Ionization energy
          + Appearance energy
          + Electron affinity
          + Proton affinity
          + Gas basicity
          + Cluster ion binding energies

     * Thermophysical property data for 33 fluids:
          + Density, specific volume
          + Heat capacity at constant pressure (C[p])
          + Heat capacity at constant volume (C[v])
          + Enthalpy
          + Internal energy
          + Entropy
          + Viscosity
          + Thermal conductivity
          + Surface tension (saturation curve only)
          + Sound speed

   You can search for data on specific compounds in the Chemistry WebBook
   based on name, chemical formula, CAS registry number, molecular weight,
   chemical structure, or selected ion energetics and spectral properties.
