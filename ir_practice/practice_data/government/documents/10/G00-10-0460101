   West Nile virus surveillance finds mosquito species not previously
   identified in western United States

   OLYMPIA - January 17, 2002 - A West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance
   project in Washington has identified a mosquito species in King County
   previously not found in the western United States. The newly discovered
   Asian mosquito is known as Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus. In the
   U.S., it has not previously been found west of the Mississippi River.
   This species is difficult to control because it deposits eggs in small
   containers such as tires, discarded bottles and cans, and other areas
   where water may collect. It is a daytime biter rather than a morning or
   evening biter and therefore harder to avoid.
