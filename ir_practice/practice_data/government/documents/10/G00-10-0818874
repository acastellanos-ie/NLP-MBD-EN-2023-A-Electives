   Locke cites improved safety and efficiencies to support transportation
   plan
   COVINGTON – Noting that continued improvements to State Route 18 are
   needed to reduce congestion and make the road safer, Gov. Gary Locke
   urged legislative action on regional and statewide transportation
   plans.
   The governor made his comments at a noontime briefing with Washington
   State Department of Transportation Secretary Doug MacDonald at the SR
   18 safety improvement project near Covington.
   “I am happy to report that we are bringing this project in on time and
   on budget,” Locke said. Noting that portions of SR 18 carry up to 5,000
   more cars per day now than it did in 1997, the governor highlighted
   improvements including widening SR 18 from two lanes to four, adding
   truck-climbing lanes, constructing new interchanges and creating a wide
   median to separate traffic.
