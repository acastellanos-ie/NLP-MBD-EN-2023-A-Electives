   The mission of the Appalachian Fruit Research Station is to identify
   critical problems of temperate fruit production; develop the science,
   technology, and genetic base needed to maximize productivity and
   quality of fruit crops; and minimize the adverse effects of biotic and
   environmental factors on these crops.         AFRS Director:  Dr.
   Dariusz Swietlik
