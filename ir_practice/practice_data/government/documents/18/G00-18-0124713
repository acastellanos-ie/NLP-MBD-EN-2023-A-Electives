    Missouri Department of Higher Education
    Missouri Coordinating Board
    for Higher Education
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Coordinating Board for Higher Education was authorized by an
   amendment to the Missouri Constitution in 1972 and established by
   statute in the Omnibus State Reorganization Act of 1974.

   The board, which heads the Department of Higher Education, serves
   without compensation. The nine members, one from each congressional
   district, are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate.
   The term of appointment is six years. No more than five of the nine
   members may be affiliated with the same political party.

   The commissioner of higher education is appointed by the Coordinating
   Board to carry out the goals and administrative responsibilities for
   the state system of higher education - with 13 public four-year college
   and university campuses, 18 public two-year campuses, 1 public two-year
   technical college, 25 independent colleges and universities, and 120
   proprietary schools serving more than 360,000 students.

   The departments primary responsibilities include:
     * the identification of statewide needs for postsecondary education,
     * statewide planning for postsecondary education,
     * the evaluation of student and institutional performance,
     * the review of institutional missions,
     * the administration of a performance funding program encouraging the
       achievement of statewide priorities,
     * the submission of a unified annual budget request of over $1.4
       billion for public higher education to the governor and Missouri
       General Assembly,
     * the administration of a statewide postsecondary technical education
       program,
     * the approval of new degree programs offered by public colleges and
       universities,
     * policy setting for and the administration of student financial
       assistance programs, and
     * the administration of the Proprietary School Certification Program.

   MOSTARS, the student assistance division of the department, administers
   federal and state student financial assistance programs that provide
   approximately $465 million to 143,000 eligible students annually. In
   addition, MOSTARS conducts outreach activities to improve consumer
   information about opportunities for postsecondary education and student
   financial assistance in Missouri and to help students avoid defaulting
   on their educational loans and accumulating credit card debt.

   The Coordinating Board has adopted a new strategic plan for the states
   higher education system, known as The Coordinated Plan for Missouri
   Higher Education. The Coordinated Plan includes five key areas on which
   all of the departments efforts will be focused:
     * student participation,
     * student performance,
     * institutional strength,
     * public engagement, and
     * system strength.

   The departments planning activities include the states public
   institutions as well as the independent institutions.
