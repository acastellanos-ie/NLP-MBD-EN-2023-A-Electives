                            Linux Support Policy

                         Fermilab Computing Division

    1. Linux on Intel PCs will be supported at Fermilab.
    2. Linux on any other hardware platform will not be supported.
    3. Redhat will be used as the basis for Fermilabs Linux.
    4. Support mechanisms will be similar to current support arrangements
       for UNIX systems. Central systems will be supported by the
       appropriate groups in the Computing Division. Desktop support will
       either be handled locally or by a combination of local support and
       the Computing Division. Data acquisition support will be handled
       under the normal development and support arrangements through the
       MOU process.
    5. Most but not all applications will be made available on Linux.
       Supported products will be made available by their regular support
       group through the standard KITS distribution means and/or via the
       Linux install server.
    6. Linux OS certification and environment support will be handled in a
       similar way to any other UNIX OS. Details will be found in the
       Computing Division documents DR0004, DR0009 and DR0010.
