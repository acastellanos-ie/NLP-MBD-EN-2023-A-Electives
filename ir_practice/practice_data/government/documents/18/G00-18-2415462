                                  JPL MarsYard

    Simulated Mars landscape developed by JPL Robotics and Mars Exploration
    Technology Programs for testing and evaluation of rovers and robotics
    technology for future Mars surface exploration.

Overview

   An important part of rover and robotic development is testing of
   prototype systems in relevant environments. Outdoor evaluation is
   particularly important as it provides natural lighting conditions and
   large test areas. In the past, rover testing has been done in the Arryo
   Seco East of JPL but this was less than ideal as the terrain was not
   representative of Mars and excessive time was spent in setting up and
   breaking down the equipment each day. Development of a large outdoor
   test area within the bounds of JPL therefore made perfect sense.

  MARSYARD 2

   [MarsYard2_Panorama.jpg]

   The second MarsYard was created in 1998 after loss of the land for the
   first one, due to construction of a new JPL Fire Station. This current
   test area is about 20m square and located in the northeast corner of
   JPL. It is bordered on the west by an office trailer for researchers
   work areas and rover storage, on the north and east by walls, and open
   on the south where there is a drop down a hill. The terrain consists of
   about 250 tons of washed sand, top by 25 tons of decomposed granite
   (DG), 10 tons of brick dust, 5 tons of small red cinders, and all the
   rocks from the previous MarsYard. Again Long Beach artst Joseph Giri
   was commission to provide a mural, this time influenced by recent
   imagery from the Pathfinder Mission. A webcam is available at:

  MARSYARD 1

Construction

   The original MarsYard was located at the corners of Explorer and
   Surveyor roads near the center of JPL grounds. This approximately 5000
   sqft area (~80' * ~60') was formerly power substation C but has been
   empty for a number of years. An existing fence around the area enable
   the area to be secured and its central location provides good
   visibility of our work to other JPLers.

   Decomposed granite (DG) fines (sand) was selected as ground cover as
   its spectral qualities are similar to those expected on Mars. 200 tons
   of DG were used to provide approximately 8" of cover over the entire
   area. A hill or sand dune was developed in the middle of the area to
   add variety (as well as to cover an existing concrete pier). 20 tons of
   volcanic rocks of different types (color, texture, density) were
   brought in th populate the area. The rocks were placed by hand by
   robotic researchers during lunch hours, evenings, and weekends.

   A concrete retaining wall along the West, North, and East sides
   provided the perfect opportunity for a mural depicting Mars. Long Beach
   California artist Joseph Giri was commissioned to do the painting. The
   view is based on Viking Lander 1 (VL1) and Viking Lander 2 (VL2)
   imagery showing a rocky plain extending off to the horizon.

Rock Distribution

   [rockdist.gif]

   One of the most important features of the MarsYard is the distribution
   of rocks based on actual Viking lander data. The Moore's model, a
   probablistic rock density for a given rock size based on VL1 and VL2
   imagery, was used to generate the rock distribution map above. This map
   was then used to lay out nearly 20 tons of volcanic rock in the
   MarsYard to recreate areas like the very rocky VL2 (shown in red), VL1
   (shown in yellow), and Mars nominal (theoretical average Mars rock
   density shown in green). Having good models of the rock distribution is
   critical for testing rovers of all sizes to ensure they are able to
   effectively maneuver and carry out scientific exploration.

MarsYard Events

     * JPL Open House 2000 - (6/4/2000) Here's a rover's eye view of the
       crowd taken with Rocky 7's mast cameras.
     * Birth of MarsYard II, demise of MarsYard I (4/20/98) - We had to
       move to another part of JPL to make way for a new firehouse.
     * Life on Mars TV Broadcasts (8/7/96) - Seven local television
       stations performed live broadcasts to talk about the NASA
       announcement of fossilized life found in meteors from Mars.
     * JPL Open House '95 and '96- The first major event for the MarsYard
       was its grand opening during the JPL Open House on July 22nd and
       23rd, 1995. A repetition of this event occurred in summer 1996 as
       well. Approximately 30,000 people came to visit JPL and see many
       displays including the MarsYard with several prototype rovers.
     * Pathfinder Air Bag Tests - The air bag retraction system for the
       Mars Pathfinder lander were tested in MarsYard to test their
       performance in a rocky mars like terrain during November 1995. A
       picture of these test appeared as part of a February 1995 article
       in Life Magazine about the Pathfinder Rover.
     * NASA Teaching From Space - The Marsyard, along with the University
       of Maryland neutral buoyancy tank, was used to host a live NASA
       Select Teaching From Space special on Robotics. Student were able
       to drive a rover in the MarsYard as well as a robot in the tank.
       November 7, 1995.
