     AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT

   1. GRANT OF LICENSE. California State Lands Commission (Provider) is an
     authorized sublicensor of products owned and created by Provider's
   licensor(s). California State Lands Commission (Provider) grants you a
     non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the documents, maps,
        images and all other content contained on this web site (the
    "Products"), solely for internal use by your business or for your own
     personal use. You may not copy, reverse engineer, translate, port,
     modify or make derivative works of the Products. You may not rent,
   disclose, publish, sell, assign, lease, sublicense, market, or transfer
   the Products or use them in any manner not expressly authorized by this
    Agreement. You shall not derive or attempt to derive the source code,
     source files or structure of all or any portion of the Products by
   reverse engineering, disassembly, decompilation or any other means. You
   shall not use the Products to operate a service bureau or for any other
   use involving the processing of data of other persons or entities. You
     do not receive any, and Provider's licensor retains all, ownership
     rights in the Products. The Products are copyrighted and may not be
    copied, even if modified or merged with other Products. You shall not
   alter or remove any copyright notice or proprietary legend contained in
                             or on the Products.
   2. LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIABILITY. The Products are provided to you on
   an AS IS and WITH ALL FAULTS basis. You assume the entire risk of loss
    in using the Products. The Products are complex and may contain some
   nonconformities, defects or errors. Provider does not warrant that the
    Products will meet your needs or expectations, that operations of the
          Products will be error free or uninterrupted, or that all
     nonconformities can or will be corrected. This Limited Warranty is
                              non-transferable.
   THE EXPRESS WARRANTY IN THIS SECTION 2 IS A LIMITED WARRANTY AND IT IS
   THE ONLY WARRANTY MADE BY PROVIDER. PROVIDER MAKES AND USER RECEIVES NO
      OTHER WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND ALL WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE
   EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED. THE STATED EXPRESS WARRANTY IS THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY
       FOR DAMAGES AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL LIABILITIES OR OBLIGATIONS OF
                                  PROVIDER.
     IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIM OR LOSS
        INCURRED BY USER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION COMPENSATORY,
   INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, LOST
       PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, EXPENDITURES, INVESTMENTS, OR
    COMMITMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BUSINESS, LOSS OF ANY GOODWILL, OR
   DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR INABILITY TO USE DATA) IRRESPECTIVE
   OF WHETHER PROVIDER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF, KNEW OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
      OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL
    CAUSES OF ACTION IN THE AGGREGATE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BREACH
       OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY,
    MISREPRESENTATION, AND OTHER TORTS. IF PROVIDER'S LIMITED WARRANTY OR
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL FOR ANY
    REASON WHATSOEVER BE HELD UNENFORCEABLE OR INAPPLICABLE, USER AGREES
   THAT PROVIDER'S LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED $100.00. Some states do not
      allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
    damages or the limitation of duration of an implied warranty, so the
     limitation or exclusion herein may not apply to you. This warranty
      shall not be applicable to the extent that any provision of this
   warranty is prohibited by any federal, state or local law which cannot
    be preempted. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you
         may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
   3. MISCELLANEOUS. The maps, data and documentation provided here do not
    constitute an official map, data or documentation of the State Lands
       Commission, nor do these materials depict the boundaries of any
       State-owned properties. This is the exclusive Agreement between
    Provider and you regarding its subject matter. You may not assign any
    part of this Agreement without Provider's prior written consent. This
     Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of California. You
    shall pay any taxes on the Products or transactions, except for those
       based on Provider's annual net income. If any provision of this
        Agreement is declared invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
    provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect. Any notice under
      this Agreement shall be delivered by U.S. certified mail, return
    receipt requested, or by overnight courier to Provider at the address
      below. Provider's licensor shall be a third party beneficiary of
    Provider's rights under this Agreement, but is not a party hereto and
                     shall have no obligation hereunder.
