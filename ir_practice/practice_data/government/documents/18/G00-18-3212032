                 NOS Participated in National Spill Exercise

   On September 24, 2001, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration's (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) participated in
   the Spill of National Significance (SONS) exercise in the Gulf of
   Mexico. The exercise scenario involved oil spills from an oil tanker,
   and an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, in addition to a spill from
   a bulk chemical carrier. Exercise scenarios occurred in New Orleans and
   Morgan City, Louisiana, and Port Arthur, Texas. Participants in the
   exercise included various commands within the U.S. Coast Guard, US EPA,
   several Texas and Louisiana agencies and industry representation from
   Exxon, Mobil, and Stolt-Nelson. NOAA provided scientific support during
   the exercise including information on weather forecasts, tides and
   currents, oil fate and affects, trajectory modeling and oil tracking,
   chemical plume dispersion modeling, shoreline assessment, resources at
   risk, and advice on environmental countermeasures and mitigation.


     NOAA Islands In the Stream Mission Conducts Monitor Sanctuary Visit

   On September 16, NOAA's Islands in the Stream Expedition, an
   international effort to
   study marine habitats fed by the system of the Loop Current, Florida
   Current, and Gulf Stream ocean currents, traveled to the Monitor
   National Marine Sanctuary to learn more about how this complex and
   dynamic ecosystem operates and to explore the diversity of habitats
   contained within the currents.
   While on the Monitor site, explorers used submersibles to reach the
   Civil War shipwreck now resting on the ocean floor. A CBS reporter and
   cameraperson accompanied scientists during the visit. Other areas to be
   investigated include the Oculina Reserve, Savannah Scarp, deep-water
   habitats along the North Carolina shelf, and the Charleston Bump. The
   mission concludes on October 1, 2001.


      NOS Research Finds Link Between African Dust and Florida Red Tide

   New research conducted by NOAA's National Ocean Service has revealed a
   surprising
   connection between red tides in the Gulf of Mexico and giant dust
   clouds that blow across the Atlantic Ocean from the distant Sahara
   Desert. Red tides, have in the past killed huge numbers of fish,
   shellfish, marine mammals, and birds. Storm activity in the Sahara
   Desert region kicks up fine particles from the arid topsoil there,
   generating vast clouds of dust. Easterly trade winds carry the dust
   across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Gulf of Mexico. The NOAA study
   shows that these clouds fertilize the water off the West Florida coast
   with iron. Plant-like bacteria use that iron to set the stage for red
   tides. NOAA and NASA satellites can spot such dust clouds en route from
   Africa to the Americas, so space-based data could help scientists
   predict when red tides will strike the Florida coast.
