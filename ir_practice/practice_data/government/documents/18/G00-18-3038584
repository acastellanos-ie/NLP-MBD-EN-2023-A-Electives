   Galileo Discovery Summary

   [1tp.gif]
   Jupiter's Hot Spots
      Jupiter's Hot Spots Jupiter's Storms and Rings
   Using data from the Galileo Probe's plunge into the top cloud layers of
   Jupiter, Galileo has discovered that Jupiter has thunderstorms many
   times larger than Earth's. These storms result from the vertical
   circulation of water in the top layers, leaving large areas where air
   descends and becomes dry like the Sahara desert, and other areas where
   water rises to form the thunderstorms. Galileo has also found that
   Jupiter's rings are made of small dust grains blasted off the surface
   of Jupiter's four innermost satellites by the impacts of meteoroids.

   Volcanic Plumes on Io
   Io's Volcanic Plumes Hot Active Volcanoes on Io
   Now considered the solar system's most active body, Io's volcanoes were
   first discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979 and result from 100 meter (328
   ft) tides in its solid surface. By taking Io's temperature with
   Galileo's instruments, scientists now know that some of Io's volcanoes
   are hotter than Earth's. From this, scientists surmise that lava made
   of silicate material rich in magnesium erupts from below Io's surface.

   Ice Rafts on Europa
   Ice Rafts on Europa A Possible Ocean on Europa
   Possessing more water than the total amount found on earth, Europa
   appears to have had a salty ocean beneath its icy cracked and frozen
   surface. Galileo images show ice "rafts" the size of cities that appear
   to have broken off and drifted apart, a frozen "puddle" smooths over
   older cracks, warmer material bubbles up from below to blister the
   surface, evaporative-type salts are exposed. A remarkable lack of
   craters show the surface to be relatively young.Europa has a thin
   oxygen atmosphere and an ionosphere.

   Ganymede
   Jupiter's Moon
   Ganymede Ganymede's Own Magnetic Field
   Internal tidal friction again causes surprising effects on the solar
   system's largest moon. Galileo revealed that Ganymede has its own
   magnetic field. Perhaps from a slightly different orbit in its past,
   enough heat from tidal friction caused the separation of material
   inside Ganymede and this stirring of a molten core or iron sulfide is
   believed to generate Ganymede's magnetic field.

   Jupiter's Moon Callisto
   Callisto's Craters Does An Ocean Hide Beneath Callisto's Surface?
   There is evidence to support the existence of a subsurface ocean on
   Callisto. The ocean would have to be deep enough inside the moon that
   it does not affect the heavily cratered surface on top. Instead the
   ocean could be showing itself indirectly, through the magnetic field it
   generates. This could come from electric flow in a salty ocean
   generated by Jupiter's strong magnetic field passing through it.
