   Dr. Mei-Ching Fok
   Astrophysicist, Interplanetary Physics Branch
   NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 692, Greenbelt, MD 20771

   Dr. Mei-Ching Fok received the B. S. degree in Physics from the Chinese
   University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 1980. She spent the year after in the
   Physics Department at CUHK as a teaching assistant. From 1981-1985, she
   taught Physics and Mathematics in a high school in Hong Kong. In the
   summer of 1985, she came to the United States with her husband to
   pursue graduate studies. In 1987, Dr. Fok received the M. S. degree in
   Physics from the Eastern Michigan University. In the following year,
   she was admitted to the Ph. D. program in the Department of
   Atmospheric, Oceanic & Space Sciences at the University of Michigan and
   received her Ph. D. degree in August 1993. Three months later, she was
   awarded an NAS/NRC Resident Research Associateship at NASA/Marshall
   Space Flight Center. In 1995, she joined the Universities Space
   Research Association (USRA) at MSFC after she left the NRC program. In
   August 1997, Dr. Fok was transferred within USRA to the Goddard Space
   Flight Center to follow her NASA sponsor, Dr. Thomas E. Moore. She
   became a NASA employee in May 2001.

   During her doctoral study, she performed statistical studies on the
   subauroral electron temperature enhancement, using measurements from
   AE-C and DE 2 satellites. Dr. Fok also developed a kinetic model to
   study the dynamics of the storm time ring current ions and the
   associated effects on the plasmasphere-ionosphere system. Her model is
   the first ring current model that incorporates a time-dependent
   plasmasphere model and thus resolves the instantaneous coupling between
   the energetic and thermal plasmas. At the Marshall Space Flight Center,
   Dr. Fok extended her ring current model into 3 dimensions and included
   realistic magnetic field configurations. Her model has been used to
   simulate the energetic neutral atom (ENA) emissions in the inner
   magnetosphere in support the IMAGE mission. She continues her work at
   GSFC on global modeling through wide collaborations with the modeling
   group at the Rice University, the MHD group at the University of
   Washington, and scientists at CETP, France.
