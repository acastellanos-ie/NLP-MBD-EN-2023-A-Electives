   The Plasma Dictionary website is based on the Fusion & Plasma Glossary
   that was originally created on FusEdWeb (Fusion Energy Educational
   Website). In response to many inquiries for a list of plasma terms,
   LLNL's Science & Technology Education Program working with Robert
   Heeter has created a database driven website just for this purpose.

   This simple dictionary allows users to submit new terms, search for
   specific terms or browse alphabetic listings. Plasma scientists are
   encouraged to add terms and definitions.

   By clarifying the meanings of specific plasma terms, it is envisioned
   that the primary use of the Plasma Dictionary website will be by
   students, teachers, researchers, and writers for
     * Enhancing literacy in plasma science
     * Serving as an educational aid
     * Providing practical information
     * Helping clarify plasma writings

   New submissions or modifications will be posted to the database within
   one week of the submission date. Terms and definitions must not contain
   any classified information or export control information. The
   contributor submitting information is solely responsible for the
   content. If you have any doubts or concerns about this request please
   send your questions to Don Correll.
