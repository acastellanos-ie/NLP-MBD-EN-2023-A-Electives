   Task Force on Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention and
   Recycling

   Executive Order 13101, Greening the Government Through Waste
   Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition, expands and strengthens
   the Federal government's commitment to recycling and buying recycled
   content and environmentally preferable products, including biobased
   products. Over a seven year period, the Federal government has more
   than quadrupled its purchases of recycled content paper and increased
   purchases of other recycled content products from 39 percent in fiscal
   year FY94 to 50 percent in FY96. E.O. 13101 is moving the Federal
   government to the next level in developing markets for "green"
   products.

   E.O. 12873 created the position of the Federal Environmental Executive
   (FEE). The FEE is appointed by the President to provide clear national
   direction for Federal agencies, track government's progress and to
   ensure agencies comply with the Executive Order. Under E.O. 13101, the
   White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) chartered the Task
   Force on Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention and
   Recycling, with the FEE as its chair. The Task Force is directed by a
   Steering Committee comprised of the FEE, the Chair of the CEQ, and the
   Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) within
   the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The purpose of the Task
   Force is to advise and assist the Steering Committee and the Federal
   agencies, make recommendations concerning policy, facilitate
   implementation, provide a centralized focal point for assistance and
   direction, and communicate and enhance knowledge of the provisions of
   E.O. 13101.

   In addition, there are other related activities such as pollution
   prevention, energy-efficient products and services, and climate change
   initiatives that are directly and indirectly related to, but not a part
   of, the immediate mission of the Task Force. The Task Force will
   coordinate, as appropriate, with other organizations and CEQ chartered
   Task Forces with respect to other Greening the Government activities.

   As we enter the 21st century, the earth's natural resources are not
   limitless. Even renewable resources are available only up to a limited
   annual capacity. Action needs to be taken today to maximize the many
   economic, environmental, and societal benefits that recycling provides.
   If we work together now we can ensure that our children and their
   children will enjoy a material and environmental quality of life even
   better than our own.
