      Program Overview

      The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) offers a summer
      research experience for students interested in exploring careers in
      cancer epidemiology and genetics. It is open to high school, college,
      and graduate students, including medical and dental students.
      Successful applicants join the Division for at least 8 weeks between
      May and September. Under the supervision of a Division researcher,
      summer students conduct research in selected areas of epidemiologic
      investigation. Students are encouraged to attend lectures offered under
      the NIH Summer Seminar Series, participate in DCEG meetings and
      seminars, attend formal NIH lectures and symposia, and participate in
      the NIH Summer Research Program Poster Day.

      Summer Student Projects

      Previous summer student projects have included:
        * Analysis of supplement use and risk of colorectal polyps data from
          the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Screening Trial.
          (Nutritional Epidemiology Branch)
        * Literature review for the Familial Predispositions to Colon Cancer
          and Breast Cancer study to determine whether families who carry a
          genetic predisposition to breast cancer may also be at risk of
          colon cancer, and vice versa. (Clinical Genetics Branch)
        * Prospective examination of whether baseline dietary intakes and
          serum levels of carotenoids and vitamin A are associated with
          subsequent risk of lung cancer within the Alpha-Tocopherol,
          Beta-Carotene Prevention Study cohort. (Nutritional Epidemiology
          Branch)
        * Analysis of the relationship between serum levels of sex-steroid
          hormones and genetic polymorphisms in biosynthesis enzymes in a
          prospective cohort of pre-menopausal women. (Environmental
          Epidemiology Branch)
        * Analysis of the role of HLA-Class II similarity/dissimilarity
          between sexual partners and the role in HIV transmission, using the
          Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study population for the data set.
          (Viral Epidemiology Branch)
        * Laser Capture Microdissection of slides from a multi-regional study
          of patients with esophageal and pancreatic cancer. (Occupational
          Epidemiology Branch)
        * A project making multiple comparisons and the effect of stratifying
          data on study power. (Biostatistics Branch)
