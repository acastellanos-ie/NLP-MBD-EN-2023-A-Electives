   UNEP/GRID - Sioux Falls Clearinghouse

      Don't Duck Metadata

      Welcome to the United Nations Environment Programme / Global Resource
      Information Database (UNEP/GRID) Clearinghouse Node. This node is one
      of numerous nodes participating in the Federal Geographic Data
      Committee's (FGDC) Clearinghouse Activity.

      The North American node of UNEP/GRID, designated as GRID-Sioux Falls,
      is located at the EROS Data Center of the U.S. Geological Survey. In
      the past couple of years, GRID-Sioux Falls has been very active in the
      development and design of scientifically credible products that support
      decision-making in areas where the international community is actively
      engaged. Some of the past products that GRID-Sioux Falls has
      participated in are the Great Lakes region of Africa, the 1997 forest
      fire disaster in South-East Asia, Hurricane Mitch that struck Central
      America in 1998, and early warning of environmental issues in Africa.
