How to Work with the Media [ top ]

     * Determine your target audience. Find out which local media outlets
       reach that audience and would be most receptive to and interested
       in your story.
     * Develop a list of contacts in the chosen media outlets and keep it
       current. Include the local religious organizations, PTAs, and
       sports leagues. Let them know that you are available, what your
       role is, what kind of information you can provide, and how to
       contact you.
     * Identify the protocols for getting event information into newspaper
       and calendar listings.
     * Watch for national or local events related to your topic and use
       them to create an event story.
     * Develop an exciting story idea! Make sure it is current and
       accurate and includes audience appeal.
     * Be prepared to speak with reporters and editors about your topic
       and all current events related to it. Be concise, accurate, and
       honest.
     * Investigate whether your chosen media outlets accept public service
       announcements (PSAs).
     * Most important, be professional, friendly, and creative!
