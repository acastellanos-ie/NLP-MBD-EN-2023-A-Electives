   and Agriculture


   Also available in Acrobat format

   Governor Gray Davis named William (Bill) J. Lyons Jr. as Secretary of
   the California Department of Food and Agriculture in January 1999. As
   Secretary, he is responsible for the development and implementation of
   agricultural public policy and programs that support California's $26
   billion agricultural industry.

   As a rancher and businessman, Secretary Lyons brings more than 26 years
   of leadership and business acumen to the department. Throughout his
   career, Secretary Lyons has worked on agricultural, water and
   environmental issues and has earned a positive reputation as a leader
   who is able to build consensus between diverse groups in order to
   achieve common ground.

   The Lyons family, with strong roots in the Central Valley, has been
   actively involved in production agriculture for more than 75 years.
   Secretary Lyons managed the 6,000-acre family ranch located in the
   Modesto area from 1976 to 1999. The ranch produces a number of crop and
   livestock commodities.

   From 1993 to 1999, Secretary Lyons served as chairman of the United
   States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Service Agency State
   Committee. As chairman he worked to oversee and enforce national
   procedures and policies for USDA farm programs in California through 32
   county offices and 200 employees. Secretary Lyons was also appointed by
   the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors to serve from 1996 to 1998
   as director of the East Stanislaus Resource Conservation District.

   Throughout Secretary Lyons' distinguished career, he has held elected
   office on a number of agriculture-related boards and commissions,
   including the California Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors,
   Modesto Irrigation District Board of Directors, Stanislaus County Farm
   Bureau Board of Directors, Stanislaus and Tuolumne County USDA
   Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service Committee, and the
   Stanislaus/San Joaquin Counties' Cattlemen's Association Board of
   Directors.

   His works and accomplishments have won him top industry honors and
   awards. The United States Department of Agriculture has awarded
   Secretary Lyons three times; in 1998 with a certificate of
   appreciation, in 1997 with an award for excellence, and in 1996 with a
   national environmental award. In 1995, the California Farm Bureau
   Federation recognized him with a service award for his many
   contributions. In addition to industry awards too numerous to mention,
   Secretary Lyons has also contributed to community and nonprofit
   organizations. The United States Jaycees named him an Outstanding Young
   Man of America in 1984, and both the City of Modesto and Stanislaus
   County have awarded him with various service commendations.

   Secretary Lyons' alma mater, California State University, Chico,
   honored him in April 2000 with a Distinguished Alumni Award. He
   graduated from there with a bachelor of science degree and secondary
   teaching credential. Secretary Lyons and his wife, Suzy, have been
   married for 22 years and have four children.
