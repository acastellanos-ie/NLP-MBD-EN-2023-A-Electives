   Taking the heat off: Nanofluids promise efficient heat transfer

   by Chad Boutin

      Heat transfer is not the most frequent topic of domestic conversation.
      But if, on a 90-degree day, your air conditioner breaks down or your
      car radiator boils over, it is immediately clear how critical it is to
      move heat efficiently from one place to another.

   Steve Choi (left) and Jeff Eastman are working with industry to improve
                                          the understanding of nanofluids.

      Engineers have been working for decades to develop more efficient heat
      transfer fluids for use in car motors and industrial equipment.
      Improved oils and coolants would make possible more efficient engines.
      Such engines would be smaller and cheaper, and their lower fuel demands
      and emissions would do less damage to the environment.

      Now, by manipulating atoms on the smallest of scales, Argonne
      scientists have created a next-generation fluid that may revolutionize
      heat transfer. By adding tiny spherical particles to a conventional
      fluid, researchers can improve by up to 40 percent its ability to
      transfer heat.

      Tiny means no larger than a few nanometers  billionths of a meter.
      Steve Choi of Argonnes Energy Technology Division and Jeff Eastman of
      the Materials Science Division developed these nanofluids. They are
      made by suspending materials like copper or copper oxide in liquids
      such as water or ethylene glycol (radiator fluid).

      Preliminary tests show that nanofluids may solve a number of problems
      plaguing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) industry.
      But their use could go beyond heat transfer in automobiles and
      manufacturing equipment. With continued research, Choi and Eastman
      envision nanofluids improving the efficiency of high-heat flux devices
      like supercomputers and providing new cancer treatment techniques.

      Nanofluids could aid industry

      Scientists have tried adding particles to fluids to improve thermal
      conductivity for a century, but the particle size caused trouble.

      In the past, due to manufacturing limitations, engineers could only
      create microparticles  large enough still to be visible to the naked
      eye and with a diameter a thousand times greater than nanoparticles.
      These microparticles were so large that, like stones in a river, they
      would quickly settle out of the fluid and sink to the bottom of a pipe
      or tank. If the fluid was kept circulating rapidly enough to prevent
      much settling, the microparticles would damage the walls of the pipe,
      wearing them thin.

      The difficulty facing engineers was to create particles small enough
      that they would remain suspended for long periods of time, but also
      able to absorb large amounts of heat quickly. Choi had long been
      frustrated with microparticles himself, so when he read an article in
      logos Vol. 11 No. 1 that Eastman and former Argonne resarcher R. W.
      Siegel were creating and studying nanometer-sized crystals, he jumped
      at the chance to try them in heat transfer fluids.

      We found that you could first condense gaseous metal oxide into
      particles between 30 and 50 nanometers in diameter, then mix them into
      a fluid afterward, Choi said. It was a two-step process. But our best
      results came when we made the nanoparticles from pure copper in a
      single step.

                                fluids.

      Why nanoparticles are better than microparticles at enhancing the
                                    heat-transfer properties of fluids.

      In this one-step process, the materials scientists heated copper to a
      vapor inside a vacuum chamber. A cooled heat transfer fluid was placed
      nearby in the chamber, and the copper vapor condensed when it touched
      the cooled fluid, forming metal spheres around 10 nanometers in
      diameter in the fluid. When Choi and Eastman used ethylene glycol, the
      copper nanoparticles improved the rate at which the fluid conducted
      heat by 40 percent . And the metal particles remained suspended. The
      elusive combination of small particles and high thermal conductivity
      had been found.

      While Eastman and Choi were inspired in part by research techniques
      pioneered in Japan and Germany, using nanoparticles to improve heat
      transfer in fluids was their own innovation. They hold a patent on the
      idea that dispersing nanoparticles into fluids can improve heat
      transfer properties.

      Nanoparticle mysteries

      Much remains unknown about nanoparticles. Argonne researchers have
      determined that materials made from nanoparticles differ from their
      larger counterparts. They appear to be stronger and more reactive than
      larger particles (see logos Vol. 18 No.1, Vol. 18 No.2 and Vol 19 No.1
      for more information on nanomaterials research at Argonne). To help us
      better understand the mysteries of nanoparticles, Argonne is preparing
      to build the Center for Nanoscale Materials to fabricate nanostructures
      and to measure their structural, physical and chemical properties.

      Nanofluids research continues. Both scientists are working with other
      institutions to broaden their knowledge base. To develop nanofluids for
      industry, Eastman has received a Small Business Technology Transfer
      grant to work with Nanopowder Enterprises of Piscataway, N.J.; Argonne
      will test the thermal properties of the fluids the company produces.
      Choi is working through a cooperative research and development
      agreement with the Valvoline Co. to investigate the physical
      capabilities of nanofluids. He is also collaborating with Purdue
      University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to investigate the heat
      transfer mechanism in nanofluids. Together, these efforts will allow
      Argonne researchers to develop a database of nanofluid properties and
      create accurate models of their behavior.

      Manufacturers will need such information if nanofluids are to be
      developed for the market. One appealing possibility is to create fluids
      whose thermal properties can be engineered to specific tasks, but at
      this point, basic facts about nanoparticles remain unclear. Eastman,
      for example, would like to know why the molecules of a base fluid keep
      nanoparticles suspended so well, since nanoparticles are still
      dramatically larger than individual molecules.

      Also unclear is the reason nanofluids conduct heat so effectively.
      Eastman speculates that it may be related to the increased surface
      interaction. Since, for a given volume of material, there are a
      greater number of particles as their size decreases, perhaps there is
      more opportunity for the nanoparticles to conduct the heat, he said.

      Another reason research must continue is to bring costs down.
      Nanofluids are expensive, in part because the equipment used to
      manufacture them is one-of-a-kind. The fluids must be made affordable
      if they are ever to see widespread use. But immediate, less orthodox
      applications of nanofluids could encourage such research.

      Possible long-term research

      One such application Choi envisions would use a nanofluid to cool
      miniaturized high heat-flux devices such as supercomputer circuits and
      high-power microwave tubes. Industry is under constant pressure to make
      technology faster and smaller, which is a challenge because of the heat
      such devices generate. A nanofluid coolant could flow through tiny
      passages in the system without the need for wide cooling channels.

      A particularly exciting potential application would be as a cancer
      treatment. Eastman is collaborating with Luis Nuñez of Argonnes
      Chemical Technology Division and others to use iron-based nanoparticles
      as delivery vehicles for drugs or radiation.

      We could guide the particles up the bloodstream to a tumor with
      magnets, Eastman said. We hope it would allow doctors to deliver high
      local doses of drugs or radiation without damaging nearby healthy
      tissue, which is a significant side effect of traditional cancer
      treatment methods.
