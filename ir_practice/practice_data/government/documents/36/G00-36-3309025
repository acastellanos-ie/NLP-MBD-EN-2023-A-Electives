          Florida's new junior senator takes up the reins of office

   Bill Nelson became Florida's junior senator on Wednesday, getting sworn
    in before a packed gallery that included the president of the United
                                   States.

     Like Grace Nelson, Bill Clinton sat among the senate spouses as the
     newly elected and re-elected senators took oaths for their six-year
                      terms. It was an unlikely scene:

   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton got her second title as senator. John
    McCain, R-Ariz., a failed presidential candidate, was in the chamber
    with the rest of his senate colleagues. And as the senate's presiding
   officer, Vice President Al Gore, who conceded the presidency to George
   W. Bush, swore in his running mate, Joe Lieberman, who had also run for
        reelection as Connecticut's senator while he sought the vice
     presidency. Nelson took it all in, calling his swearing-in ceremony
                       "awesome. Absolutely awesome."

   "I was waking up this morning and seeing the sun rise over Washington,
      D.C., just to pinch myself and realize I've got this great public
               service at a very important time," Nelson said.

    "Senator" his latest title, after insurance commissioner and, before
                          that, U.S. House member.

    Nelson carried a worn Bible for his swearing-in, dog-eared with notes
      scribbled throughout, and his name engraved on the maroon leather
                                   cover.

   He walked down the center aisle of the Senate chamber Wednesday, arm in
     arm with his senior colleague, Bob Graham, to take his oath. It is
     tradition for every senator being sworn in to be escorted by their
                           state's other senator.

    "I put my arm around him. It was just a wonderful privilege. I have a
    feeling of enormous gratitude and a feeling of humility. What a great
              senior senator for me to serve with" Nelson said.

   Although he's a freshman, Nelson is not exactly a new kid on the block.
           He served in the House with 33 other current senators.

    "This was like a homecoming for me. These are people that I not only
      admire and respect, but these are people that I genuinely like."

       He was not totally complimentary on his first official day as a
    senator. He joined Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle in demanding
   that the evenly divided Senate get similar representation in committee
   assignments. Republicans will hold the majority after the inauguration
        only because Vice President-elect Richard Cheney will be the
     tie-breaker in votes. Therefore, Republicans still decide how many
               members of each party can serve on committees.

    "(Republican leader) Trent Lott has got to agree to a 50-50 ratio on
    committees. If he doesn't, you're going to see the first battle lines
                           being drawn," he said.

      While acknowledging "these are certainly unique times," Lott said
    "we're continuing to talk (about committee assignments), and I think
    we've made progress." He would not get into specifics about how many
       members of each party would be allowed to serve on committees.
   Currently, Democrats make up less than 45 percent of most committees -
              less than their new representation in the Senate.

      Graham joined his new colleague in threatening "consequences" if
     Republicans refuse to be more inclusive with Democrats in the 107th
                            session of Congress.

    "The president sets the point. If he does not follow through with his
   stated desire to be a unifier, not a divider, then I think he will see
      the consequence, which is paralysis, gridlock and further public
   dissatisfaction with the way in which their national government is not
                                functioning."
