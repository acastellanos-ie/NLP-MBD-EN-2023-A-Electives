                            Project Organization
     __________________________________________________________________

   The WFC3 is being built by a team of scientific and technical personnel
   at:
     * Hubble Space Telescope Project at NASA/GSFC in collaboration with
       the
     * Space Telescope Science Institute
     * Ball Aerospace Corp.
     * Marconi Applied Technologies
     * NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory
     * Rockwell Scientific
     * Conexant Systems, Inc.
     * Barr Associates

   This team was selected in order to "reuse" as much expertise as
   possible as these institutions and companies have been intimately
   involved with the development of the previous HST instruments.

   WFC3 is the first HST instrument to be developed as a "facility"
   instrument by the HST Project. The WFC3 developers perform their work
   as a service to the astronomical community . They do not get guaranteed
   scientific observation time on HST. This is a concept that has been
   used successfully by both the Planetary and Earth Sciences communities
   in their instrument development projects.

   In order to ensure that WFC3 will meet the expectations of the general
   community, a NASA-selected panel of scientific representatives will be
   working intimately with the WFC3 Project. This Scientific Oversight
   Committee will advise the WFC3 Project on all major decisions regarding
   instrument capabilities and will approve the scientific tradeoffs
   during the instrument development process.

   The WFC3 Instrument Management Office is a part of the HST Flight
   Systems and Development Project at GSFC. The WFC3 effort is led by the
   WFC3 Instrument Scientist and the WFC3 Instrument Manager, and is
   supported by a systems engineering staff. Scientific and technical
   support is drawn from the Space Telescope Science Institute, Ball
   Aerospace, JPL, and local GSFC contractors, as needed, to form the
   Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that produce the hardware.
