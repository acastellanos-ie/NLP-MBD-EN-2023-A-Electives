Welcome to the web-site of the SSC History Collaboration

     The SSC History Collaboration is a group of scholars working on a
     multi-author, academic history of the Superconducting Super Collider
     (SSC). We are also generating a special collection that provides
     reference material for our history of the SSC. Eventually, this
     collection, sited at the Archives of the Fermi National Accelerator
     Laboratory, will be accessible to other scholars.
     This work is supported in part by a research grant from the National
     Science Foundation.

   Members of the Collaboration:

     Lillian Hoddeson
     Michael Riordan
