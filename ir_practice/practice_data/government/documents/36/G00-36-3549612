   The recent work of Hoi-Ying Holman, Dale Perry, Michael C. Martin,
   Wayne R. McKinney, and Jennie Hunter-Cevera entitled "Synchrotron
   Infrared Microspectroscopy to Study Chromium-Biomolecule Interactions
   at the Bacterial-Mineral Interface" was recently highlighted at the
   216th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society held in Boston.
   The paper describing this research was selected for the SciMix program,
   which highlights interdivisional research and selects papers which are
   viewed as attracting the most interest by the conference attendees.

   Abstract:

   Hexavalent chromium is carcinogenic, mutagenic and highly toxic to
   living organisms. Synchrotron microspectroscopy has been used to study
   in situ and nondestructively the chromium-biomolecule interactions in
   the mid-infrared region (4000-400 cm^-1) as bacteria Arthrobacter
   oxydans attach themselves to magnetite surfaces. Relative band
   intensities and band intensity ratios for functional groups of
   organically-derived biological molecules that are inherent to the
   experimental system are examined. The biomolecular components as they
   are perturbed by interactions with water, dichromate, and chromate
   metal ions on the mineral surfaces are analyzed. Spatial variations of
   the biochemical and chemical spectral markers that represent the
   inorganic-organic interactions at the biological-mineral interfaces are
   mapped microscopically. Comparative analyses of the synchrotron
   infrared microspectra suggest that the A. oxydans-chromium interactions
   depend on the solubility (at the physiologic pH) and toxicity of the
   chromium compounds. It appears that in the presence of the less soluble
   and less toxic dichromates, A. oxydans produced microbial extracellular
   polysaccharides and trapped the dichromate ions on the cell surface. On
   the contrary, in the presence of the more soluble and more toxic
   chromates, A. oxydans would reduce the metal ions. It was not clear if
   the reduction process took place on or inside the cells.
