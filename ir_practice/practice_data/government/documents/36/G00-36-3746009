            published, page numbers)
          + Many of the listings also have short summaries of the article
            (abstracts)
          + Sometimes you will find a link to the full article

          Please note that most of the articles you will find listed in
          MEDLINE are written for health professionals. Articles are for
          educational use only and are not intended to replace advice from
