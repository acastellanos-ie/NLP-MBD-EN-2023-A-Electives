    Commerce Secretary Don Evans Calls on Senate to Pass Smith Amendment

   Washington, DC - Commerce Secretary Donald Evans today called on the
   Senate to pass the Smith Amendment to the economic stimulus package.

   "We need to do all we can at this time to keep America working and
   reinvigorate our great economic engine. Accelerating depreciation over
   the next three years, as the President proposed, could provide
   meaningful stimulus for our innovators and entrepreneurs. By contrast,
   the one-year proposal offered by the Majority Leader will do far less
   for our workers and businesses."

   Under the incentive provision, companies that purchase technology
   assets and place them into service would be permitted to accelerate the
   expensing of those assets through a one-time depreciation deduction.
   Many suggest that such a deduction could help reinvigorate the IT
   industry, which has been struggling since 2000 but remains critical to
   our economic recovery.

   "Accelerated depreciation is particularly critical for our technology
   sector," observed Evans. "America's technology sector has powered our
   economy for much of the past decade, creating jobs, increasing
   productivity, and expanding exports. We need to help them get back on
   their feet and to the forefront of our growth once again. The Smith
   Amendment will help re-ignite technology growth."

   Secretary Evans additionally expressed hope that the accelerated
   depreciation proposed by the President, and embodied in the Smith
   Amendment, will speed infrastructure deployment, especially for
   high-speed, high-capacity data networks -- the broadband Internet.

   "We believe the Smith Amendment will also help accelerate the
   deployment and usage of broadband networks. Broadband holds great
   promise for our economy and our society, helping employers
   revolutionize their processes and business methods. Broadband will also
   improve education, healthcare, national security and entertainment."
