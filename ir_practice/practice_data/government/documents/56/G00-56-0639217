        Tidal or Water Limitations:

        yes - site will flood during extreme high tide (10 feet +). Access
        to Willapa Bay may be difficult at high tide because of the height
        of the US101 bridge crossing Smith Creek.

        Driving Directions:

        From Raymond, W on SR 105 10.2 mi; cross Smith Creek, turn R to ramp
        area.
        Site Description:

        The boat ramp has a moderate grade. The ramp area has been widened
        due to heavy use. Area tends to flood during high tide and heavy
        runoff. There are bullet holes in the steel door to the vault
        toilet. The concrete walls of the vault have been shot several times
        creating pock marks in the wall face. WSDOT had set up a scale
        operation in the parking area during the time of the site visit. A
        high tide of ten feet or more will cover the entire parking area.
        The US101 bridge crossing Smith Creek may be too low for some boats
        to go under during high tide.
