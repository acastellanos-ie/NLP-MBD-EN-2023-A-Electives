   Imagine a world where no matter who you are or where you are, you can
   get the health care you need when you need it.

                            Can you picture this?


     Woman using home health care device A world where people living in
   far-flung areas need not travel hundreds of miles to get specialty care
                        that could save their lives?

      A world where you will be treated in an emergency room by a nurse at
              your side and a physician at a distant emergency department?
     Clinicians observing patient at remote site using teleconferencing
                                  equipment
   Clinician looking at image on computer screen A world where doctors and
    nurses in rural America can learn about new medical practices at the
                          touch of a computer key?


                       These pictures are real because
                             the future is now.

   Technologies used in telehealth  videoconferencing, the Internet,
   store-and-forward imaging, streaming media, satellite and wireless
   communications  already exist, but are not yet part of the regular
   landscape for our nations rural and urban underserved peoples.  In
   fact, the health care industry itself lags behind other industries such
   as finance, insurance and education which have already integrated
   information systems into their daily routines.  Health care analysts
   believe that health care is at least ten to fifteen years behind in
   computing.

                               What can we do?

   HRSA has established the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT)
   to serve as a leader in telehealth, a focal point for HRSAs telehealth
   activities and as a catalyst for the wider adoption of advanced
   technologies in the provision of health care services and education.

                           So what is Telehealth?

   Telehealth is the use of electronic information and telecommunications
   technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and
   professional health-related education, public health and health
   administration.

   We hope our Web site will help you coordinate your telehealth
   activities, learn about telehealth best practices, deliver
   information you need and provide a forum for discussion among various
   telehealth players.

   We encourage you to make this site useful.  Please send suggestions,
   comments and upcoming events to ksleezer@hrsa.gov.
