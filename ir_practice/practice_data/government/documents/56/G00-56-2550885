                        General Information and Facts
     * The Youthful Offender Parole Board is the paroling authority for
       young persons committed by the courts to the Department of the
       Youth Authority. The Board was established in 1941 by the
       Legislature and was known as the Youth Authority Board. When the
       Department of the Youth Authority was created in 1942, the Director
       also served as the Chairman of the Board. The Board separated from
       the Department of the Youth Authority on January 1, 1980, and was
       renamed the Youthful Offender Parole Board.
     * There are seven members of the Board, appointed by the Governor to
       four-year terms with the consent of the Senate. One member is
       designated as Chairman by the Governor.
     * The case of each ward shall be heard by the Board immediately after
       the case study of the ward has been completed. The Board shall
       periodically review the case of each ward for the purpose of
       determining whether existing orders and dispositions should be
       modified or continued. These reviews shall be made as frequently as
       the Board considers desirable and shall be made at intervals not to
       exceed one year.
     * The Board works closely with the individual victim and Youth
       Authority Victim's Services within the confines of PC 679.02, WIC
       656.2, 1761.1 and Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations.
     * The Board uses a classification system which designates young
       offenders by categories of offense. These categories, along with
       the totality of the ward's complete juvenile record, guide the
       Board in setting parole considerations dates; that is, that
       presumptive period of incarceration after which a person can be
       released to parole without being a danger to society.
     * During the 1999/2000 fiscal year, the Board conducted 22,454
       hearings.
     * Additionally, the Board is also mandated to hold public meetings
       with the Director of the Youth Authority to discuss policies of the
       Board and the Department as they relate to each organization's
       functions.
     * The Executive Officer is Susan C. Wallace, JD.
