   The Southern California Coastal Wetlands Inventory is a database of
   existing information on 41 coastal wetlands that lie between Mexico and
   Pt. Conception in northern Santa Barbara County. It provides three
   types of information for each site: 1) a map of the wetland's
   historical extent; 2) a map of recent habitat distributions; and 3) a
   "profile" which briefly describes ecological conditions, and land use
   and enhancement histories.
