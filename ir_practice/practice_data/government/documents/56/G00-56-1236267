   [vspacer.gif]   Mission

   The mission of the Applied Numerical Algorithms Group (ANAG) is the
   development of advanced numerical algorithms and software for partial
   differential equations integrated with the application of the software
   to problems of independent scientific and engineering interest. The
   primary focus of our work is in the development of high-resolution and
   adaptive finite difference methods for partial differential equations
   in complex geometries, with applications to internal combustion engines
   and other industrial problems.

Chombo: Adaptive Mesh Refinement Library

   The Chombo package provides a set of tools for implementing finite
   difference methods for the solution of partial differential equations
   on block-structured adaptively refined rectangular grids. Both elliptic
   and time-dependent modules are included. Support for parallel platforms
   and standardized self-describing file formats are included. 2D
   visualization based on X is also included. A reference manual is
   available online as well.

   STATUS:Chombo 1.0 released 12 October 2000.

ChomboVis

   3D visualization tool for 3D AMR data. Tcl/TK graphical user interface
   to a VTK based rendering package. Supports common visualization
   techniques (isosurface, cut planes, grid visualization).

   STATUS:ChomboVis 1.0 released 12 October 2000

Embedded Boundary Library

   EBChombo is a collection of C++ classes for the construction of
   numerical PDE algorithms in complex geometries using the embedded
   boundary method. EBLib also includes extensions to BoxLib, a library
   for the construction of numerical PDE algorithms on rectangular grids,
   developed by CCSE.

   STATUS: EBLib is in its development phase. The design document for
   EBLib is available now, as is a reference manual.
