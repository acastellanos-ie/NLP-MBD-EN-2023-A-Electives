   Polar Operational Environmental Satellite
   Polar Orbiting Satellites
   The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global
   coverage, by making nearly polar orbits roughly 14.1 times daily. Since
   the number of orbits per day is not an integer the sub orbital tracks
   do not repeat on a daily basis, although the local solar time of each
   satellite's passage is essentially unchanged for any latitude.
   Currently in orbit we have a morning and afternoon satellite, which
   provide global coverage four times daily. The POES system includes the
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Tiros
   Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS).
   Because of the polar orbiting nature of the POES series satellites,
   these satellites are able to collect global data on a daily basis for a
   variety of land, ocean, and atmospheric applications. Data from the
   POES series supports a broad range of environmental monitoring
   applications including weather analysis and forecasting, climate
   research and prediction, global sea surface temperature measurements,
   atmospheric soundings of temperature and humidity, ocean dynamics
   research, volcanic eruption monitoring, forest fire detection, global
   vegetation analysis, search and rescue, and many other applications.
