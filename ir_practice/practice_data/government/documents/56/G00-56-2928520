   PAC 2001 FAQs
 Account Creation
    1. Why do I need a submission account?
       The purpose of the submission account process is to make submission
       easier for you. In the past, authors have needed to enter personal
       information on a variety of different forms and remember various
       unique ID numbers. The submission account simplifies this process.
       It saves time because an author can make multiple submissions on
       the same account. Therefore the author enters his/her personal
       information only once and only needs to remember one username and
       password.
    2. Can secretaries or other designees create accounts for primary
       authors?
       Secretaries or other designees can create accounts and submit
       abstracts and papers for primary authors. The account, however,
       must be created in the primary author's name and contain his/her
       personal information and email address. If you are a secretary or
       other designee submitting papers for a group, please note that each
       submitting author must have his/her own account.
    3. Do you support special characters?
       PAC 2001 supports a variety of special characters. Special
       characters are available for names, titles and abstracts. Codes and
       instructions can be accessed from the special characters link,
       available at the top of all relevant forms. Please do not use any
       HTML codes that are not provided on the special characters page.
    4. Why are APS/DPB and IEEE fields required?
       PAC 2001 is required to collect information on affiliations with
       APS/DPB and IEEE. Everyone participating in the conference is
       required to supply this information. If you are unsure of your
       affiliation with either organization or you do not know if your
       co-authors are affiliated, please choose Not Sure from the list of
       options.

   Paper Submission
    1. I tried the LaTeX2e template for US letter on several machines, in
       all cases the text (in the .ps) is not centered in the page, but
       starts at the very top, and the bottom margin is twice what it
       should be. How do I fix this?
       This is most likely a dvips problem. First, check to make sure that
       you have the latest version (5.86). Next, make sure that dvips is
       set up to create postscript in US letter format instead of A4
       format, which is the default. The configuration exists in a global
       configuration file. For dvips itself there is a file called
       config.ps (on UNIX it is found at .../texmf/dvips/config/config.ps)
       that contains the global default settings for the dvips options. If
       A4 appears before US Letter, the system is printing A4 as a
       default. You should move the information as indicated below to get
       the system to print US Letter. Alternatively, you can comment out
       the A4 lines (using %). This will also cause the system to print
       properly. See examples below for correct setups for both A4 and US
       letter:
       Here is the correct setup for creating postscript for A4 paper
       (this is also the default setup):

       @+ %%BeginPaperSize: a4
       @+ a4

   Abstract Submission
    1. How do I enforce superscript and subscript in my title?
       Simply use the HTML tags < sup > and < sub > to enforce superscript
       and subscript in your title or your abstract. For example: X< sup
       >2< /sup > and Y< sub >4< /sub > will appear as X^2 and Y[4]. A
       list of HTML tags available for use in your PAC titles and
       abstracts may be accessed from the special characters link,
       available on all relevant forms.
    2. Why are you asking for Author affiliation information on the
       Abstract Submission Page instead of on the Account Creation Page?
       Some authors may be affiliated with multiple laboratories. We want
       authors to be able list a different affiliation for each abstract
       instead of being limited to one affiliation per account.
    3. Why is the primary authors information automatically entered into
       the speaker fields?
       The primary author is often the speaker at the conference. This
       default is intended to make submission easier for you. If the
       speaker is someone other than the primary author, just type his/her
       information into the fields.
    4. What is the required disclaimer?
       The required disclaimer is a reference to your funding agency and
       contract number. For example: Work supported by the U.S. Department
       of Energy. This information will be included as an endnote to your
       abstract.
    5. There is nowhere to add co-authors on the abstract submission page.
       How do I enter my co-authors information?
       You will have the opportunity to add co-authors after you submit
       your abstract. There is a button labeled co-authors on the abstract
       information page. Please click this button to add co-authors. We
       are requesting that you add each co-author separately so that we
       can track their personal information and so that we can easily
       manipulate the data for our publications.
