   Who We Are

   The Little Hoover Commission is a bipartisan, independent state body
   that promotes efficiency and effectiveness in state programs.  Created
   in 1962, the Commission is formally named the Milton Marks "Little
   Hoover" Commission on California State Government Organization and
   Economy.  As a member of the Assembly, former Senator Milton Marks
   authored legislation that created the Commission.  The Commission is
   modeled after a federal commission created in 1947 to address the
   growth of government, chaired by former President Herbert Hoover.  The
   federal panel became known as the Hoover Commission, while the
   California panel has become known as the Little Hoover Commission.
