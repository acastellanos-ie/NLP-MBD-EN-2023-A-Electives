                            NIST CENTENNIAL GALA
                                MARCH 6, 2001
                              WASHINGTON, D.C.
   _______________________________________________________________________

     Welcome everyone. Im pleased and honored to be here this evening to
   share in the celebration honoring one of Americas treasured resources.

   I visited NIST shortly after my confirmation and I said then, as I will
    now, Im proud of this agency and the role it has played creating the
   environment in which our nations businesses can thrive here and abroad.
    The work performed by the fine people at NIST is especially important
       in this age of technology and has, in fact, contributed to the
    tremendous growth experienced in the high-tech sector of our economy.

     Im a businessman, so I appreciate I demand a good investment.  And
   American taxpayers have always received a high rate of return on their
     investment from NIST. The work of this agency touches us in so many
                      waysat work, at home and at play.

    NIST scientists were there when America needed a reliable navigation
   system that would allow airplanes to land safely in poor weather. Work
     of the agency paved the way for the introduction of the radio into
                       virtually every American home.

     Just last week, the people of Seattle benefited greatly from NISTs
    leadership in the development of earthquake resistant-building design
    and construction, which prevented the human and economic injury there
                        from being much, much worse.

    And really close to my heart as an oil and gas man, NIST innovations
     have allowed trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and billions of
      barrels of oil to be accounted for accurately, saving millions of
                     dollars for industry and consumers.

     NIST did some of its best work during very demanding times for our
     peopleincluding the research that lead to large scale production of
                    synthetic rubber during World War II.

   NIST, along with other agencies, was very active during the 1950s, 60s
    and 70s, when the federal government spent the equivalent of about 2
        percent of GDP on research and development. This involvement
    contributed heavily to the economic progress we are enjoying today --
         to increases in productivity and higher employment levels.

     This progress has brought greater opportunities for Americans and a
                         higher standard of living.

    According to the National Academy of Sciences, the federal government
   currently spends the equivalent of about .7 percent (seven 10ths of one
    percent) of GDP for research. The federal commitment to R&D has been
    cut in half since the mid-60s, when spending on the space program and
             national defense took a bigger chunk of the budget.

    I think we have to take a look at where we currently stand on federal
     spending for research and development We want to make sure that our
     commitment to R&D is reasonable and effective. In that regard, the
    federal government should be a leader and reach into the future with
                its commitments to research and development.

     We should look 10, 20 and 30 years into the future. We must set our
     sights not on the next quarter, but on the next quarter century. My
   friends, future discoveries will be found in the labs, universities and
   other research venues that are funded by partnerships among the federal
                 government, state governments and academia.

        And NIST must be a part of these efforts and the creation of
          innovations that will carry our economy into the future.

   We should also be aware that NISTs work with industry on standards has
       helped American companies compete in the global marketplace. As
      barriers to international trade and commerce come down, economic
    integration goes up. And NIST needs to be in the mix, helping develop
   uniform standards that promote increased trade opportunities. This role
    is absolutely critical to creating the environment in  which American
    businesses can prosper at home and abroad. I expect that cooperation
   and trust between NIST and the private sector will continue to be close
     as we globalize standards and bring about a level playing field in
          international trade that allows participants to prosper.

      Its clear that NIST has worked successfully with its counterparts
        around the world, which is evident by the many distinguished
                international guests we have with us tonight.

     All told, this is quite a list of accomplishments.  And it was made
   possible by the remarkable quality of the people working at the agency.
   That quality is told by the fact that NIST is one of only a few federal
       institutions able to claim a Nobel Prize winner, Dr. William D.
    Phillips, and a winner of the National Medal of Science, Dr. John W.
                                    Cahn.

   Let me close by thanking the agency for its first 100 years of service
     to the nation and by saying that I look forward to working with its
                             fine people there.

                     Thank you, and enjoy your evening.
