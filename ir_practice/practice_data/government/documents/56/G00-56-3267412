                       Whale Watching in the Sanctuary

   Whale Behaviors

                                                            tail slapping

     Whale watchers should scan the surface of the water, whether from the
            shore or a boat, for blows, tail slapping or unusual activity.

   Each winter in Hawai`i brings an increased buzz of excitement and
   influx of visitors to the islands--not just in the form of two-legged
   tourists, but of the long-finned, gargantuan variety as well. We're
   talking about humpback whales, the State of Hawai`i's official marine
   mammal. From as early as September until as late as May, humpback
   whales can be seen in the near-shore waters surrounding the Hawaiian
   Islands.

   Scientists estimate that approximately 4,000 to 5,000 humpback
   whales--two-thirds of the North Pacific stock--migrate to Hawai`i each
   winter. From their feeding grounds in Alaska, they cross 3,000 miles of
   ocean to reach their winter destination, which offers the promise of
   relaxation, adventure and "romance." The primary activities that
   humpback whales engage in during their stay in Hawai`i include mating,
   birthing and nursing. Male humpbacks also spend their time

   techniques.

   Sighting humpback whales can be an awe-inspiring experience whether
   from the water or the shore. Their impressive acrobatic displays are
   visible from miles away. Mothers can be seen teaching their calves to
   breach, and males can be seen competing with one another in fierce
   head-to-head battles. The underwater vocal stylings of male humpback
   whales can even be heard by divers, snorkelers and boaters. It is no
   wonder, then, that the thrill of such encounters has fostered a strong
   love of humpbacks in the islands and has contributed to the development
   of a multi-million dollar whale-watching industry in Hawai`i.

   There are a variety of ways in which you can catch a glimpse of one of
   Hawai`i's humpback whales. Boat tours and whale-watching cruises
   continue to be a

      Lana`i Lookout on the east side of O`ahu is a popular spot for whale
     watching. Here, volunteers for the annual Ocean Count crowd this site

   popular venue, but oftentimes, whales can be seen quite easily from the
   shore. Each February, the sanctuary conducts the Sanctuary Ocean Count
   to get a better idea of the number of humpback whales that frequent the
   waters around the islands of O`ahu and Hawai`i. The hundreds of
   volunteers who turn out for this event each year are often surprised to
   learn that humpbacks can be seen from the beach, the road, and
   sometimes even from their own balconies! If you know where to look, you
   may be lucky enough to see one yourself.
