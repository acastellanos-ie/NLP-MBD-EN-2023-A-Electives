   This page updated 28 January 2002.

   Descriptions of mines, prospects, and mineral occurrences in the Alaska
   Resource Data File (ARDF) are published for individual U.S. Geological
   Survey 1:250,000-scale quadrangles in Alaska (see accompanying map or
   table) as USGS Open File Reports and are available for downloading from
   this site.

   These descriptions are divided into fields which describe each mine,
   prospect, or mineral occurrence. The records in the database are
   generally for metallic mineral commodities only but also may include
   certain high value industrial minerals such as barite and rare earth
   elements. Common industrial minerals such as sand and gravel, crushed
   stone, and limestone and energy minerals such as peat, coal, oil and
   gas are not included in this database.

   An explanation of the fields used in the database and ARDF reports for
   individual quadrangles can be viewed or downloaded from this site using
   software or browsers capable of reading files in the Portable Document
   Form at (PDF) (see instructions below).

   The descriptions in the database were compiled using published
   literature, unpublished reports and data from various sources including
   the U.S. Bureau of Mines, the U.S. Geological Survey, and industry.
   Compilation of this database is an ongoing process and each report is a
   progress report. We would appreciate comments, corrections or
   additional information from database users. If one of the incomplete
   quadrangles is of interest to you, please select it in order to
   register your interest with the Western Region Mineral Resources Survey
   .

   The ARDF data for the individual quadrangles that have been completed
   has also been aggregated into a single composite ARDF database that is
   available in several digital formats.
