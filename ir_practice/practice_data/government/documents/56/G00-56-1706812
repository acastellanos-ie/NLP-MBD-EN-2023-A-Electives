   Herman the Hermit Crab What's New
   Herman the Hermit Crab

   Welcome to FEMA for Kids! I'm Herman, the spokescrab for the site. This
   site teaches you how to be prepared for disasters and how you can
   prevent disaster damage. You can also learn what causes disasters, play
   games, read stories and become a Disaster Action Kid. A story about my
   search for a disaster-proof shell is great reading, too! Disasters
   aren't fun, but learning about them is!
