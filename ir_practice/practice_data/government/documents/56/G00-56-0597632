   NOTE:
   Beginning January 1, 2002
    All civil(cv) cases filed in the United States District Court for the
   Eastern District of New York will be placed in the Courts
    Case Management/Electronic Case Files System (CM/ECF).

   [DataIcon.gif]  Electronic Access:
   A key feature of the CM/ECF system is that it provides unprecedented
   access to up-to-the-second docket sheets as well as to the documents
   themselves over the Internet through the Courts electronic filing web
   site.
   (ecf.nyed.uscourts.gov). Live
   (ecf-train.nyed.uscourts.gov) Training

   [DataIcon.gif]  Electronic Filing:
   Another key feature of the CM/ECF system is that it accepts documents
   filed electronically over the Internet. While it is not necessary that
   documents be filed electronically to have them entered into the CM/ECF
   system, electronic filing is strongly encouraged by the Court.

   [DataIcon.gif]  Electronic Noticing:
   A third key feature of the CM/ECF system is that it provides immediate
   e-mail notices to all counsel involved in a case whenever a document is
   filed. To receive electronic notice of filings, attorneys must be
   registered to file electronically and must have the e-mail noticing
   feature of their Court account turned on.

   [DataIcon.gif]  Attorney Registration:
   In order to file documents electronically and to receive e-mail notices
   of documents that are filed, attorneys must be admitted to practice
   before the Court and must be registered to file electronically. Upon
   registration, attorneys will be provided with an identification name
   and password that will allow access to the system. The identification
   name and password will also serve as the attorneys signature for Fed.
   R. Civ. P.11 purposes on all documents that are filed electronically.
   Attorney admission and electronic filing registration forms are
   available through the Clerks Office and on the Courts web page.

   [DataIcon.gif]  Public Access(non-filers and attorneys):
   In order to query ecf cases/dockets, please obtain a pacer account.
   Refer to the Pacer Service Center for more information or call them at
   (800) 676-6856 or (210) 301-6440

   [DataIcon.gif]  System Requirements:
   System requirements are minimal and inexpensive. To view documents in
   the system, all that is needed is Internet access, Netscape Navigator
   4.6x and 4.7x higher and the Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0 or higher. To
   file documents electronically, attorneys will also need Adobe Acrobat
   PDF Writer software. A scanner may also be needed for imaging documents
   that do not exist in electronic format. Both Netscape Navigator and
   Adobe Acrobat Reader software are widely available for free.

   [DataIcon.gif]  Training:
   Training in the use of the CM/ECF system can be arranged for attorneys
   by contacting Terry Vaughn (718) 260-2331) or Cinthia Mahon (631)
   712-6011). An online user manual is available. Registered attorneys can
   also practice filing and retrieving documents using a test system.

   [DataIcon.gif]  Learning More About It:

   can be obtained from the Clerk's Office through our Electronic Filing
   Materials which include: registration forms, an ECF Handout, FAQ,

   information can be obtained from the U.S. Courts website.
