   Forecast R&D Division Mission . . .

        To conduct basic and applied research that leads to the improvement
        of forecast services within the National Weather Service (NWS) for
        hazardous and severe weather events. The FR&D Division uses a
        combination of observations and modeling to conduct its research and
        test new forecast techniques. The Division collaborates with NWS
        forecast offices through Science Operations Officers, the NWS Storm
        Prediction Center, and the NWS National Center for Environmental
        Prediction, in addition to other government agencies and
        universities.
