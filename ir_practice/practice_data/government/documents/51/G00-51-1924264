   The NASA Microgravity Research Program's Biotechnology discipline
   focuses on the development of new technologies to enhance current
   biological research and to open up new avenues of related research. As
   one of the most dynamic segments of our high-technology economy,
   biotechnology is playing an increasingly important role in medical
   research and the development of pharmaceutical drugs, agricultural
   research and products, and environmental protection. NASA's
   microgravity biotechnology program contributes to three major areas of
   research: fundamental biotechnology science, protein crystal growth and
   cell and tissue culturing.
