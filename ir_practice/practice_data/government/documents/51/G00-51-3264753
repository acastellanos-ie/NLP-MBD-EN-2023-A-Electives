   Standards for Public Health in Washington State

   A Collaborative Effort by State and Local Health Officials

   June, 2001

   Background

   Understanding health issues

   Protecting people from disease

   Assuring a safe, healthy environment for people

   Prevention is best: promoting healthy living

   Helping people get the services they need

   Background: Standards for Public Health in Washington State

   People depend on the governmental public health system to respond to
   public health threats and to prevent costly health problems that cause
   illness or death. Every resident and visitor, throughout the state,
   should be assured that the public health system is working to protect
   their health at all times. Standards for Public Health in Washington
   State provides a common, consistent and accountable approach to
   assuring that basic health protection is in place.

   Standards for Public Health in Washington State
   was developed in a collaborative process involving more than 100 public
   health professionals who work at state and local health departments.
   They shared their scientific knowledge and practical experience to
   define standards for the governmental public health system.

   The importance of standards

   Common standards provide a clear and accountable measure of performance
   for public health agencies a level of protection citizens can count on.
   Setting standards for public health will help us identify what we need
   to do to strengthen public health protection and will also let us
   measure improvements in the effectiveness of the public health system.

   State laws require that we set basic standards for public health as a
   part of the biennial Public Health Improvement Plan, a process designed
   to strengthen the public health system in order to improve the health
   of people. (See: RCW 43.70.520 and RCW 43.70.580)

   Complementary roles for state and local government

   In Washington State, responsibility for public health protection is
   shared among the Washington State Department of Health, the State Board
   of Health, and 34 local government public health jurisdictions with
   local boards of health.

   Local and state agencies perform different tasks. They have unique, but
   complementary, roles and they rely on one another to make the public
   health system work. The standards recognize that state and local
   responsibilities are different. A single standard is proposed for the
   public health system, with separate state and local measures that
   demonstrate whether a standard is met. All residents depend on this
   strong partnership between state and local government.

   This set of standards was purposely limited to the responsibilities of
   state and local government. The contributions of non-government health
   providers and community-based organizations are essential, but they are
   separate from the specific accountability expected of government
   agencies.

   A common sense framework addressing five key areas

   The standards cover five key aspects of public health, selected because
   they represent basic protection that should be in place everywhere:

     * Understanding health issues
     * Protecting people from disease
     * Assuring a safe and healthy environment for people
     * Promoting healthy living
     * Helping people get the services they need.

   In developing standards, the guiding principles were: define what is
   basic, use clear language, describe what every jurisdiction should be
   able to do regardless of size or location, incorporate the ideas of
   nationally described core functions and essential services of public
   health, and support the standards with a few carefully selected
   measures that demonstrate whether the standards have been met.

   The standards focus on the capacity of our public health agencies to
   perform certain functions, and not on specific health issues. A public
   health system that is well organized, meeting a common set of basic
   standards and adopting best practices, is better prepared to help bring
   about improvements in health. In a separate effort, we are developing a
   list of leading health indicators that will help answer the questions:
   How healthy are we? What are our significant health problems? Who is
   most affected? Indicators were separated from standards because of the
   belief that it is important to focus on both health trends and the
   level of performance in the public health system.

   The standards are not intended to substitute for the complex body of
   public health law, multiple regulations and individual county
   ordinances that have developed over time. The laws and regulations are
   vitally important to public health protection, but each is intended to
   address very specific issues. Standards for Public Health in Washington
   State provides a framework to assess how well our governmental public
   health system is working, overall; existing laws and regulations fit
   very well within that framework.

   Field test results

   The standards were field-tested in summer 2000 with on-site visits to
   every local health jurisdiction and many state health department
   programs. The purpose of the field test was to determine how well the
   standards and measures worked for evaluation. The standards and
   measures held up very well in testing and some additional measures were
   added. The visits also yielded a collection of best practice materials
   that are being shared statewide so that agencies can more easily meet a
   standard, adapting existing work to fit their needs.

   Meeting the standards will take time

   The next step in the process of developing standards is to conduct a
   baseline test. That will give us our first real documentation of how
   far we are from meeting the standards today.

   From the field test, it was learned that some standards are met now,
   and some will take time or resources to achieve. It is expected that
   some standards will be beyond our reach for some time to come. Yet,
   even these unmet standards will provide an important guidepost for our
   future and a way to measure progress as we work toward meeting them.

   The standards are expected to become part of the contract between the
   state and local agencies in the future, but we expect they will be
   phased in, using the results of the baseline study. The Public Health
   Improvement Plan Act of 1995 required that the state develop
   "performance-based contracts" with each local agency, based on "the
   core functions of public health." Our approach has been to develop the
   standards collaboratively with both state and local officials, and to
   set forth a specific timeline for meeting the standards only after we
   have had time to assess our capacity to meet them.

   Public health is everyones concern

   People care about issues that affect their health. On any given day, a
   glance at the newspaper articles reminds us that people place high
   value of public health protection. Setting standards for performance of
   our public health system will assure that basic protection is available
   to all people in Washington State.

  On the following pages
  Standard               applies to the whole governmental public health system
  Local Measures         lists measures to show that a local health jurisdiction
                         meets the standard
  State Measures         lists measures to show that the State Department of
                         Health meets the standard
  While many different measures could be used, these were selected as the
  best and most practical measures to indicate how well the public health
  system is meeting each standard.
