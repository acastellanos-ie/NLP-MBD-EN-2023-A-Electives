                      Community Based Health Promotion



   Program Overview:

   The Community-Based Health Promotion Program (CBHP) is committed to
   working with communities to help build promising health and wellness
   programs. We seek to nurture successful strategies with support,
   expertise, and funding. This is done by:
     * Providing educational and training opportunities on health
       education and health promotion, which includes co-sponsoring
       statewide and regional conferences.
     * Developing partnerships and collaboration with other statewide,
       regional, and local public health agencies in the public and
       private sectors, to improve the health status of Alaskans
       throughout the state.
     * Advocating for statewide, regional, and local health promotion
       activities, policies, and resources.

   How this is accomplished:

   The Community-Based Health Promotion Program oversees the federal
   Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant. Under the federal
   requirements for this grant CBHP is responsible for establishing an
   Advisory Committee that is chaired by the State Health Officer, Dr.
   Peter Nakamura. The Advisory Committee assists CBHP in determining what
   the priority health areas are for Alaska, and developing a
   comprehensive state plan. This plan must address the Healthy People
   2010 Risk Reduction Objectives. The federal fiscal year 2000 plan
   includes the following projects:
    1. Community-Based Health Promotion, which provides community-based
       grants, coordination of health promotion and prevention activities,
       and development of local and state health promotion and health
       education capacity.
    2. Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control, which supports the
       Take Heart Alaska and the Alaskans Promotion Physical Activity
       Coalitions, and implements the Take Heart Alaska Plan.
    3. EMS Symposia, which encompasses EMS best practices for presentation
       and participation in the annual EMS symposium.
    4. Pre-hospital EMS Data Collection, which funds the establishment of
       two EMS data collection stations.
    5. Residential Fire Prevention, which targets the Yukon-Kuskokwim and
       lower income Anchorage neighborhoods to receive working smoke
       alarms.
    6. Planning and Evaluation Unit to determine a methodology for
       measuring years of healthy life, and identifying ten major
       preventable causes of disability and limited activity of Alaskans.
    7. Turning Point, which funds Maniilaq for inclusion in the Robert
       Woods Johnson Turning Point project.
    8. Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System to support continued
       surveillance of the health status of Alaskans.
    9. Sexual Assault Prevention and Education, which is implemented by
       the Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault to conduct
       sexual assault planning, and provide grant funds to local programs
       for mandated youth sexual assault prevention programs.

   2000-2001 Community-Based Health Promotion Program Goals

   State Health Status Objective:
   By December 2000, increase [healthy] expected years of life at birth
   by  5% from the 1986-1990 baseline of 73.4 to 77.1 as the best
   available proxy for increase in years of healthy life, for the general
   population in Alaska, and increase expected years  of life for Alaska
   Natives by 5% from 67.3 to 70.7. (Baseline: Not available.)

   Risk Reduction Objectives:
   By July 1, 2001, increase the number of community health promotion
   programs that separately or together address at least three of the
   Healthy People 2000 priorities to reach a cumulative total of at least
   40 percent of the population. (Baseline: The community of Hoonah, in
   1994, initiated the first community-based health promotion program
   organized to address Healthy People 2000.)

   Annual Activity Objectives:

   I. By July 1, 2001, increase the available resources dedicated to
   health promotion and health education throughout Alaska. (Baseline: 5
   grants totaling $96,000 were made to community-based agencies in
   SFY00.)

   II. By December 31, 2000, increase the training opportunities for
   health professionals and paraprofessionals in the areas of health
   promotion and health education throughout Alaska. (Baseline: Not
   available)

   III. By December 31, 2000, provide leadership to increase the level of
   coordination and collaboration among health promotion services,
   agencies, and programs throughout Alaska. (Baseline: Not available)

   IV. By December 31, 2000, provide support and technical assistance to
   local health promotion and health education programs and services in
   addressing the lead causes of death, disability and disease, and the
   behavioral, non-behavioral and environmental factors related to these
   health problems. (Baseline: Not available)

   V. By December 31, 2000, build and expand local and State capacity to
   provide health promotion services and health education programs.
