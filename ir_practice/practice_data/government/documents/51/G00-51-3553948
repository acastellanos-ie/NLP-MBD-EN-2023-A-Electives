     Although not among the most common of neoplasms, brain tumors are
     among the most devastating. Mental impairment, seizures, and
     paralysis afflict the very core of the person and have a
     demoralizing effect on loved ones. Added to these burdens is the
     knowledge that, for most brain tumors, adequate treatment is not
     available and the likelihood for long-term survival is poor. In
     children, even if they do survive, the devastating impact of disease
     and treatment often leaves permanent neurological damage....

     The priorities outlined in this report provide a framework to guide
     progress in the field of brain tumor research. A concerted,
     interdisciplinary, and timely approach to addressing these
     priorities will allow the development of new diagnostic and
     therapeutic techniques that may ameliorate and, it is hoped,
     eventually cure brain tumors.
