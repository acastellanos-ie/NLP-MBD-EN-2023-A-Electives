   Key Energy Issues to 2020

   Over the past year, energy markets have been extremely volatile, with
   high prices for oil and natural gas and concerns for energy shortages
   earlier in the year giving way to an economic slowdown and lower prices
   following the September terrorist attacks in the United States. Those
   events are incorporated in the short-term projections for the Annual
   Energy Outlook 2002 (AEO2002), but long-term volatility in energy
   markets is not expected to result from their impacts or from the
   impacts of such future events as supply disruptions or severe weather.
   AEO2002 focuses on long-term events, including the supplies and prices
   of fossil fuels, the development of U.S.electricity markets, technology
   improvement, and the impact of economic growth on projected energy
   demand and carbon dioxide emissions through 2020.

   The AEO2002 projections assume a transition to full competitive pricing
   of electricity in States with specific deregulation plans. Other States
   are assumed to continue cost-of-service pricing. The projections
   include recent delays in restructuring plans in several States.
   Problems in California have slowed the trend to restructuring, and
   retail access in the State has been suspended. The projections include
   the contracts entered into by California to guarantee electricity
   supplies in the State, leading to higher electricity prices than in the
   Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001). Increased competition in
   electricity markets is also represented through changes in the
   financial structure of the industry and efficiency and operating
   improvements.

   World oil prices remained relatively high through most of 2001, largely
   due to actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
   (OPEC)and some non-OPEC countries to restrain oil production. U.S.
   natural gas prices achieved record levels in 2001 due to a cold winter
   and tight supplies caused by reduced drilling in response to low prices
   in 1998 and 1999. Electricity prices also reached record levels in
   California, as a result of restructuring difficulties, tight natural
   gas markets, low hydroelectric generation levels, and other generation
   problems. Energy prices began to decline later in 2001, however, in
   response to the slowing economy and more normal supply markets for
   natural gas and electricity.

   Economic Growth

   Although there was an economic slowdown in the United States in 2001,in
   the long term the U.S economy, as measured by gross domestic product
   (GDP), is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 3.0 percent
   from 2000 to 2020, similar to the rate of 2.9 percent projected in
   AEO2001 for the same period.Most of the determinants of economic growth
   are similar to those projected in AEO2001, but there are some
   differences. For example, commercial floorspace is expected to increase
   at an average annual rate of 1.7 percent through 2020, as compared with
   1.2 percent in AEO2001. The AEO2002 projection has a significant impact
   on energy demand in the forecast for that sector and is more consistent
   with recent historical trends.

   Energy Prices

   The average world oil price is projected to decline from $27.72 per
   barrel in 2000 (2000 dollars) to $22.48 per barrel in 2001, before
   beginning a gradual increase after 2002.In 2020, the projected price
   reaches $24.68 per barrel (Figure 1), as compared with $22.92 per
   barrel projected in AEO2001, largely due to higher projected world oil
   demand. Because of the effectiveness of OPEC in managing oil production
   and the generally slow response of non-OPEC supply to higher world oil
   prices,projected prices in the years following 2002 remain higher than
   in AEO2001.

   World oil demand is projected to increase from 76.0 million barrels per
   day in 2000 to 118.9 million barrels per day in 2020, higher than the
   AEO2001 projection of 117.4 million barrels per day,due to higher
   projected demand in the United States and developing countries,
   including the Pacific Rim and Central and South America.Growth in oil
   production in both OPEC and non-OPEC nations leads to the relatively
   slow growth of prices through 2020.OPEC oil production is expected to
   reach 57.5 million barrels per day in 2020, nearly double the 30.9
   million barrels per day produced in 2000, assuming sufficient capital
   to expand production capacity.

   Non-OPEC oil production is expected to increase from 45.7 to 61.1
   million barrels per day between 2000 and 2020, 1.7 million barrels per
   day higher than projected in AEO2001,due to higher projected production
   in the Caspian Basin, offshore West Africa, and Brazil. Production from
   the Caspian Basin is expected to exceed 6.5 million barrels per day by
   2020.By 2010, projected production in Brazil reaches nearly 2 million
   barrels per day and in the offshore regions of West Africa exceeds 2
   million barrels per day. North Sea production is expected to peak in
   the middle of the current decade, reaching 7.5 million barrels per day,
   with a slower decline rate than earlier expected.By 2010, oil
   production in Mexico is expected to increase by 30 percent above
   current levels.

   The average wellhead price of natural gas is projected to increase from
   $3.60 per thousand cubic feet in 2000 to nearly $4 per thousand cubic
   feet in 2001, then decline sharply in 2002. The price is expected to
   reach $3.26 per thousand cubic feet in 2020, slightly higher than the
   projection of $3.20 per thousand cubic feet in AEO2001. Although
   projected natural gas demand in 2020 is 1.0 trillion cubic feet lower
   than was projected in AEO2001, the price is expected to be higher due
   to a less optimistic assessment of natural gas reserves discovered by
   exploratory drilling. As the expected demand for natural gas increases
   over time, price increases are slowed by technological improvements in
   natural gas exploration and production. The transmission and
   distribution margins to electricity generators are projected to be
   higher than in AEO2001, under the assumption that generators will pay
   higher rates to guarantee pipeline capacity, particularly as natural
   gas is expected to be used more for baseload and intermediate- load
   generation.

   In AEO2002, the average minemouth price of coal is projected to decline
   from $16.45 per ton in 2000 to $12.79 per ton in 2020, slightly lower
   than the price of $12.99 per ton projected in AEO2001. Higher projected
   demand in AEO2002 is met by increased production from lower cost
   western mines. Through 2020, the price is expected to decline with
   increasing productivity in mining, a shift to western production, and
   competitive pressures on labor costs.

   Average electricity prices are projected to decline from 6.9 cents per
   kilowatthour in 2000 to 6.5 cents per kilowatthour in 2020, higher than
   the 6.1 cents per kilowatthour projected for 2020 in AEO2001, due to
   higher projections for natural gas prices, electricity demand,
   particularly in the commercial sector, and natural gas margins to
   electricity generators. Electricity industry restructuring contributes
   to declining projected prices through reductions in operating and
   maintenance costs, administrative costs, and other costs. Electricity
   prices are projected to decline to 6.3 cents per kilowatthour by 2006
   then rise in the last 5 years of the forecast as natural gas prices
   rise. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission actions on open access and
   other changes for competitive markets enacted by some State public
   utility commissions are included in the projections, but because not
   all States have deregulated their electricity markets, the projections
   do not represent a fully restructured electricity market.

   Energy Consumption

   Total energy consumption is projected to increase from 99.3 to 130.9
   quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) between 2000 and 2020, an
   average annual increase of 1.4 percent. In 2020, this forecast is
   nearly 4 quadrillion Btu higher than in AEO2001, primarily due to
   higher projected energy demand in the commercial and transportation
   sectors. The projections incorporate efficiency standards for new
   energy-using equipment in buildings and for motors mandated through
   1994 by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 and the
   Energy Policy Act of 1992, including the new residential and commercial
   equipment standards.

   Residential energy consumption is projected to grow at an average rate
   of 1.0 percent per year, with the most rapid growth for
   computers,electronic equipment, and appliances. In 2020,the projected
   residential demand is 24.3 quadrillion Btu, slightly lower than
   projected in AEO2001. Lower projected energy demand, particularly for
   natural gas, results from 2-percent lower housing starts in 2020,
   higher projected natural gas prices, and the new equipment efficiency
   standards announced in January 2001, as revised by the Bush
   Administration.

   Commercial energy demand is projected to grow at an average annual rate
   of 1.7 percent, reaching 23.2 quadrillion Btu in 2020, 2.4 quadrillion
   Btu higher than in AEO2001. Commercial floorspace is projected to grow
   by an average of 1.7 percent per year, as compared with 1.2 percent per
   year in AEO2001, raising the demand for energy for many end uses in the
   commercial sector. The January 2001 equipment standards have a smaller
   impact in the commercial sector than in the residential sector. The
   most rapid increases in demand are projected for computers, office
   equipment, and telecommunications and other equipment.

   Industrial energy demand is projected to increase at an average rate of
   1.1 percent per year, reaching 43.8 quadrillion Btu in 2020, slightly
   higher than in the AEO2001 forecast. Industrial gross output is
   projected to grow at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent; however,
   the growth is partially offset by an average projected decline in
   industrial energy intensity of 1.5 percent per year.Contributing to
   this decline is a continuing projected shift to less energy-intensive
   industries. The average annual growth in non-energy-intensive
   manufacturing is expected to be 3.3 percent, compared with 1.2 percent
   for energy-intensive manufacturing.

   Transportation energy demand is projected to grow at an average annual
   rate of 1.9 percent, to 39.6 quadrillion Btu in 2020, 1.1 quadrillion
   Btu higher than in AEO2001. The projected energy demand for light-duty
   vehicles and heavy trucks is higher in AEO2002,because a reevaluation
   of recent trends in both travel and efficiency indicates more rapid
   growth in travel and slower growth in efficiency. In 2020, projected
   efficiency for new cars,new light trucks, and heavy trucks is lower by
   0.8, 0.9, and 0.6 miles per gallon, respectively, than in AEO2001.

   Electricity demand is projected to grow by 1.8 percent per year from
   2000 through 2020, the same rate as in AEO2001; however, demand is 2
   percent higher in 2020. The most rapid growth is expected for
   computers, office equipment, and a variety of residential and
   commercial appliances and equipment.

   Demand for natural gas increases at an average annual rate of 2.0
   percent (Figure 2), from 22.8 to 33.8 trillion cubic feet between 2000
   and 2020, primarily due to rapid growth in demand for electricity
   generation. Total natural gas demand is projected to be 1.0 trillion
   cubic feet lower than in AEO2001, due to lower projected residential
   and electricity generation demand, offset in part by higher projected
   commercial demand.

   In AEO2002, total coal consumption is projected to increase from 1,081
   to 1,365 million tons between 2000 and 2020, an average increase of 1.2
   percent per year.This projection is 68 million tons higher than the
   AEO2001 projection due to higher projected demand for electricity
   generation, which constitutes about 90 percent of the domestic demand
   for coal.

   Petroleum demand is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.5
   percent through 2020, led by growth in the transportation sector, which
   is expected to account for more than 70 percent of petroleum demand in
   2020. Projected demand in 2020 is higher than in AEO2001 by 830
   thousand barrels per day due to higher transportation demand.

   Renewable fuel consumption, including ethanol for gasoline blending, is
   projected to grow at an average rate of 1.7 percent per year through
   2020, primarily due to State mandates. Nearly 55 percent of the
   projected demand for renewables in 2020 is for electricity generation
   and the rest for dispersed heating and cooling, industrial uses,
   including cogeneration,and fuel blending. The projected demand for
   renewable fuels in 2020 is 0.7 quadrillion Btu higher than in AEO2001,
   mainly due to higher use of biomass for industrial cogeneration and
   increased generation from geothermal and wind energy.

   Energy Intensity

   Between 1970 and 1986, energy intensity,measured as energy use per
   dollar of GDP,declined at an average annual rate of 2.3 percent as the
   economy shifted to less energy-intensive industries and more efficient
   technologies in light of energy price increases (Figure 3). With slower
   price increases and growth of more energy-intensive industries,
   intensity declines moderated to an average of 1.5 percent per year
   between 1986 and 2000. Energy intensity is projected to continue to
   decline at an average annual rate of 1.5 percent through 2020, as
   continuing efficiency gains and structural shifts in the economy offset
   growth in demand for energy services.

   Energy use per person generally declined from 1970 through the
   mid-1980s, increasing when energy prices declined.Per capita energy use
   increases slightly in the forecast, with efficiency gains only
   partially offsetting higher demand for energy services.

   Electricity Generation

   Generation from natural gas,coal,and renewable fuels is projected to
   increase through 2020 to meet growing demand for electricity and offset
   the projected retirement of some existing fossil-fuel-fired and nuclear
   units (Figure 4). The projected levels of generation from power plants
   using coal, nuclear, and renewable fuels are higher than in AEO2001 due
   to higher projected electricity demand,assumed improvements in the
   operating costs and performance of nuclear plants, and higher natural
   gas prices, which reduce natural-gas-fired generation relative to
   AEO2001.The share of generation from natural gas is projected to
   increase from 16 percent in 2000 to 32 percent in 2020, and the share
   from coal is projected to decline from 52 percent to 46 percent as a
   more competitive electricity industry invests in the less
   capital-intensive and more efficient natural gas generation
   technologies.

   Nuclear generating capacity is projected to decline from 2000 to 2020,
   but a reevaluation of the agingrelated costs for nuclear plants and the
   expectation of higher natural gas prices lead to a higher projection
   than in AEO2001. Nuclear plant retirements in the forecast are based on
   the cost of maintaining operation compared with the cost of new
   capacity. Of the 98 gigawatts of nuclear capacity available in 2000, 10
   gigawatts are projected to be retired by 2020, as compared with 26
   gigawatts of retirements in AEO2001. No new nuclear plants are expected
   to be constructed by 2020 in the reference case, based on the relative
   economics of alternative technologies.

   Renewable technologies are projected to grow slowly because of the
   relatively low costs of fossil-fired generation and because competitive
   electricity markets favor less capital-intensive natural gas
   technologies over coal and baseload renewables. Where enacted, State
   renewable portfolio standards, which specify a minimum share of
   generation or sales from renewable sources, contribute to the growth of
   renewables. With higher expected levels of industrial cogeneration and
   wind and geothermal generation, total renewable generation,including
   cogenerators, is projected to increase by 1.3 percent per year to a
   2020 level that is slightly higher than in AEO2001.

   Energy Production and Imports

   Total energy consumption is expected to increase more rapidly than
   domestic energy production through 2020. As a result,net imports of
   energy are projected to meet a growing share of energy demand (Figure
   5). Projected U.S. crude oil production declines at an average annual
   rate of 0.2 percent from 2000 to 2020, to 5.6 million barrels per day.
   Production is projected to increase in the latter half of the forecast
   and is 0.6 million barrels per day higher in 2020 than in AEO2001, due
   to production from more fields in the National Petroleum Reserve-
   Alaska, which is expected to begin in 2010. As a result of projected
   increases in natural gas plant liquids production, total petroleum
   production is expected to increase through 2020 (Figure 6). Increasing
   demand for petroleum is projected to raise the share of demand met by
   net imports from 53 percent in 2000 to 62 percent in 2020 (lower than
   the 64-percent share in AEO2001, due to higher domestic production).

   As demand for natural gas increases in the forecast, production is
   expected to increase from 19.1 to 28.5 trillion cubic feet between 2000
   and 2020,an average annual rate of 2.0 percent. Projected production in
   2020 is 0.6 trillion cubic feet lower than in AEO2001, because the
   projected rate of growth in demand is lower in AEO2002. Net imports,
   primarily from Canada, are projected to increase from 3.5 to 5.5
   trillion cubic feet between 2000 and 2020. Net imports of liquefied
   natural gas (LNG) are projected to increase to 0.8 trillion cubic feet
   by 2020. The remaining two of the four existing U.S. LNG import
   facilities have announced plans to reopen, and three of the four have
   announced capacity expansion plans.

   U.S.coal production is projected to increase at an average annual rate
   of 1.3 percent, from 1,084 million tons in 2000 to 1,397 million tons
   in 2020, as domestic demand grows. Projected production in 2020 is 66
   million tons higher than in AEO2001. Coal exports are projected to
   decline slightly through 2020, as European demand for imports declines
   as a result of environmental concerns and competition from other
   producers.

   Renewable energy production is projected to increase from 6.5 to 8.9
   quadrillion Btu between 2000 and 2020, with growth in industrial
   biomass, ethanol, and all sources of renewable electricity generation,
   with the exception of solar. Renewable energy production in 2020 is 0.6
   quadrillion Btu higher than projected in AEO2001, due to higher
   expected levels of industrial cogeneration and generation from
   geothermal and wind energy.

   Carbon Dioxide Emissions

   Carbon dioxide emissions from energy use are projected to increase at
   an average rate of 1.5 percent per year, from 1,562 million metric tons
   carbon equivalent in 2000 to 2,088 million in 2020 (Figure 7).
   Projected emissions in 2020 are higher by 47 million metric tons carbon
   equivalent than in AEO2001, due to higher projected energy demand in
   the commercial and transportation sectors and more coalfired
   electricity generation than in AEO2001. The higher projection for
   nuclear generation in AEO2002 offsets some of the increase that would
   be expected to result from these trends, but carbon dioxide emissions
   still are expected to increase more rapidly than total energy
   consumption, as a result of increasing use of fossil fuels, a slight
   decline in nuclear generation, and slow growth in renewable generation.

   The projections do not include future actions that might be taken to
   reduce carbon dioxide emissions but do include voluntary actions to
   reduce energy demand and emissions.
