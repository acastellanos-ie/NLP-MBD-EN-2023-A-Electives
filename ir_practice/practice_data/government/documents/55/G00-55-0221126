   Experiments are needed to test and extend present understanding of
   confinement, macroscopic stability, alpha-driven instabilities, and
   particle/power exhaust in plasmas dominated by alpha heating. A key
   issue is to what extent pressure profile evolution driven by strong
   alpha heating will act to self-organize advanced configurations with
   large bootstrap current fractions and internal transport barriers. A
   design study of a Fusion Ignition Research Experiment (FIRE) is
   underway to assess near term opportunities for advancing the scientific
   understanding of self-heated fusion plasmas. The emphasis is on
   understanding the behavior of fusion plasmas dominated by alpha heating
   (Q 5) that are sustained for durations comparable to the characteristic
   plasma time scales ( 20 E and ~ skin, where skin is the time for the
   plasma current profile to redistribute at fixed current). The
   programmatic mission of FIRE is to attain, explore, understand and
   optimize alpha- dominated plasmas to provide knowledge for the design
   of attractive magnetic fusion energy systems. The programmatic strategy
   is to access the alpha-heating-dominated regime with confidence using
   the present advanced tokamak data base (e.g., Elmy-H-mode, 0.75
   Greenwald density) while maintaining the flexibility for accessing and
   exploring other advanced tokamak modes (e. g., reversed shear, pellet
   enhanced performance) at lower magnetic fields and fusion power for
   longer durations in later stages of the experimental program. A major
   goal is to develop a design concept that could meet these physics
   objectives with a construction cost in the range of $1B. 1.
   Introduction TABLE I. DESIGN GOALS FOR FIRE FIRE is envisioned as an
   extension of the R (m), a (m) 2.0, 0.525 existing advanced tokamak
   program leading to 95 , 95 1.8, 0.4 an attractive magnetic fusion
   reactor. The q95 > 3 configuration chosen for FIRE is similar to that
   Bt(Ro) (T) 10(12)* of ARIES-RS [1], namely a highly shaped Wmag TF (GJ)
   3.7 plasma, with double-null divertor and aspect Ip (MA) 6.44(7.7)*
   ratio 4. The FIRE design activities have flattop time (s) ~20(12)*
   focused on the physics and engineering alpha heating fraction >0.5
   evaluation of a compact, high-field tokamak E, skin (s) ~ 0.6, ~ 13
   with the parameters shown in Table I. The key Zeff (3% Be + He (5 E))
   1.4 "advanced tokamak" features are: strong plasma Fusion Power (MW)
   100 - 200 shaping, double null poloidal divertors, low ICRF Power (MW)
   30 toroidal field ripple (< 0.34%), internal control Tokamak Cost ($B)
   ~ 0.3 coils and space for wall stabilization Project Cost ($B) ~1
   capabilities. The magnets and structure are also * Higher Field Mode
   capable of operation at Bt(Ro) = 12T and Ip = 7.7 MA with a flat top
   time of 12 s at 200 MW of fusion power. Recently, an improved physics
   performance design point, FIRE*, has been identified with slightly
   lower aspect ratio (3.6 vs. 3.81), slightly increased triangularity
   (0.5 vs 0.4), Ro = 2m, a = 0.565m, Bt(Ro) = 10T, and Ip = 7.7 MA with a
   flat top time ~ 15 to 20s at 125 MW of fusion power. The engineering
   feasibility of FIRE* is being evaluated. 2. Physics Performance
   Projections for FIRE The physics design guidelines for FIRE are similar
   to those developed for ITER-FEAT [2] from analysis of the H-Mode
   confinement database DB03v5(9) [3]; * Confinement is assumed to scale
   as ITER98(y,2) with an H-factor determined by matching JET H-Mode data
   for FIRE-like conditions * Operating density from 0.3 < n/nGW < 0.85
   where nGW is the Greenwald density * H-mode power threshold is given by
   P 0.58 th = 2.84 n20 B0.82Ra0.81M-1 * N = (%) / (Ip/aB) < 2.5 * Helium
   ash confinement He* = 5 E, with 3% Be impurities in the plasma core.
   2.0 The operating regime for FIRE is well matched ASDEX AUG FIRE CMOD
   to the existing H-mode database from 0.3 < D3D JET n/nGW < 1.0 as shown
   in Fig. 1. The 1.5 JFT2M JT60U performance of FIRE was projected by
   PBXM PDX selecting JET data from DB03v5(9) [4] with H(y,2) parameters
   similar to FIRE, namely N 1.7, 1.0 Zeff < 2.0, > 1.7 and 2.7 < q95 <
   3.5. The average density profile peaking, n(0)/V for 0.5 these
   FIRE-like JET points was found to be 1.2. Modeling of standard pellet
   injection DB03v5 H-Mode scenarios indicates peaking factors of 1.2. 0.0
   Guided high field side pellet launch will be 0.0 0.2 0.40.6 0.8 1.0 1.2
   incorporated with the goal of providing n/nGW additional density
   profile peaking. The FIG. 1. H-Mode Database and FIRE impurity level
   for these analyses was chosen to be 3% Be, where Be is the plasma
   facing material of the first wall, giving a Zeff (imp) = 1.36. This
   assumption is consistent with the trend toward lower Zeff as the
   density is increased in Alcator C-Mod [5]. The tungsten concentration
   in the plasma core must be below ~10-5 to avoid significant radiation
   loss. It is assumed that tungsten from the divertor plate and any other
   impurities present in the divertor do not migrate to the plasma core.
   The use of tungsten coated tiles in the baffle region of the divertor
   of ASDEX Upgrade [6] is encouraging with regard to maintaining
   acceptably low levels of tungsten in the plasma core. A 0-D power
   balance code was used to calculate the H factor required to achieve a
   given Q- value as shown in Fig. 2. The density profile was assumed to
   have n(0)/V = 1.2 with 3% Be and self-consistent alpha ash
   accumulation. The required H-factor increases at high density where the
   plasma temperature decreases thereby reducing fusion reactivity. At low
   density the H-factor increases because E must increase to maintain n E
   approximately constant. The uncertainty in the projections of FIRE
   performance can be expressed as a fraction of the 1.4 JET Data 100 10

   achieving a specific alpha heating fraction FIRE-like JET data points
   that would achieve a specific alpha-heating fraction f = Palpha/Pheat =
   Q/(Q + 5) as shown in Fig. 3. The baseline configuration is projected
   to achieve the FIRE Mission requirement of f 0.5 (Q > 5) for 53% of the
   FIRE-like JET points and would achieve f > 0.67 (Q 10) for 4% of the
   data set. Operation of FIRE at 12T/7.7 MA or FIRE* the candidate design
   point (7.7 MA) have significantly higher performance with > 90% of the
   FIRE-like JET data projected to achieve Q 5, > 50% projected to achieve
   Q 10 and > 25% projected to achieve Q 20. The operating space for FIRE
   can also be described using the PopCon plot as shown in Fig. 4 for
   cases similar to those described above with H98(y,2) = 1.1 and n(0)/V =
   1.2. The FIG. 4a Operating Space for FIRE (10T) FIG. 4b. Operating
   Space for FIRE (12T) transported power exceeds the H-mode threshold by
   a factor of at least 1.3 to the right of the P/Pthr = 1.3 curve. The
   baseline FIRE (10T) attains alpha-dominated conditions but only over a
   limited range. The operating range for FIRE* and FIRE (12T) are
   similar, and achieve alpha-dominated conditions, Q > 5, over a large
   range and Q > 10 over a significant range. A Tokamak Simulation Code
   (TSC) simulation of this regime with H(y,2) = 1.03 and n(0)/V = 1.2
   indicates that FIRE can access the H-Mode and sustain alpha-dominated
   plasmas for 30 E, > 6 He and ~ 1.5 skin as shown in Fig. 5. In
   addition, sufficient time is provided for plasma startup and a
   controlled shutdown to avoid plasma disruptions. The burn phase can
   study plasma profile evolution, alpha ash accumulation and techniques
   for burn control and begin studies of plasma current evolution due to
   alpha heating. Power (MW) 10 T, 6.44 MA, ~20 s FT A longer term goal of
   FIRE is to 60 B explore advanced tokamak regimes t using pellet
   injection and current ramps 50 Bt to create reversed shear plasmas
   (e.g., Q = 5 40 PEP modes) for durations of 1 to 3 Alpha Power current
   redistribution times. This AT 30 Ip Ip capability is expected to
   produce 20 Auxiliary Power modestly enhanced confinement and beta as
   observed in present large 10 Ohmic Power tokamak experiments, and would
   0 provide a continuous transition from H- 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 Time
   (seconds) mode operation to advanced tokamak Startup Sustained Burn
   Shutdown operation. An important feature of the FIG. 5. Evolution of a
   fusion-dominated plasma. FIRE cryogenic copper alloy magnets is that
   the pulse length increases rapidly as the field is reduced with
   flattops of ~ 40 s at 8 T and ~90 s at 6 T. If confinement and are
   increased by 20 and 40% respectively, then the fields could be reduced
   by 20% and FIRE would have the capability to explore fusion- dominated
   plasmas for 40 s (~ 3 skin). Physics scenarios and engineering
   solutions for power handling are not yet developed for the longer pulse
   (~ 40 s) scenarios. 3. Technology Considerations for FIRE The baseline
   magnetic fields and pulse lengths can be provided with BeCu/OFHC
   toroidal field (TF) coils and OFHC poloidal field (PF) coils that are
   pre-cooled to 77 °K prior to the pulse and allowed to warm up to 373
   Wedged TF Coils (16) °K at the end of the pulse [7]. The cross-section
   of FIRE is shown Compression Ring schematically in Fig. 6. The 16 TF
   Double Wall Vacuum Vessel coil system is wedged with a compression ring
   to resist de-wedging at the top and bottom of the inner TF leg.
   Shielding is added between the Internal Shielding walls of a double
   wall vacuum vessel to reduce nuclear heating of the coils, Control Coil
   limit insulation dose and allow hands- on maintenance outside the
   envelope Passive Stabilizers of the TF coils within a few hours W-pin
   Outer Plate after a full power D-T shot. Large actively cooled (1.3 m
   by 0.7 m) midplane ports provide access for heating, FIG. 6. FIRE
   Configuration diagnostics and remote manipulators, while 32 angled
   ports provide access to the divertor regions for utilities and
   diagnostics. FIRE is being designed mechanically to accommodate 3,000
   full field, full power pulses and 30,000 pulses at 2/3 field. The
   repetition time at full field and full pulse length will be < 3 hr,
   with shorter times at reduced field or pulse length. The fusion energy
   production of 5 TJ (similar to BPX) produces a lifetime neutron dose to
   the TF insulating material at the inboard midplane of 1.5 x 1010 Rads
   which is consistent with the polyimide insulation being considered. The
   power densities on the divertor plates are ~6 MWm-2 for detached
   operation and ~25 MWm-2 for attached operation [8]. Carbon is not
   allowed in the vessel due to tritium inventory build-up by
   co-deposition. The divertor plasma-facing components are tungsten
   "brush" targets mounted on copper backing plates, similar to a concept
   developed by the ITER R&D activity. The outer divertor plates and
   baffle are water-cooled, while the inner divertor targets and first
   wall are cooled by mechanical attachment to water-cooled copper plates
   inside the vacuum vessel. The first wall is comprised of Be
   plasma-sprayed onto copper tiles. The high neutron wall loading (3MWm2)
   at full fusion power of 200 MW contributes significantly to the first
   wall and vacuum vessel heating. The water-cooled copper plates inside
   the vessel alleviate excess heating of the stainless steel vessel due
   to neutrons. Sixteen cryo-pumps  closely coupled to the divertor
   chambers, but behind sufficient neutron shielding  provide pumping (
   100 Pa m3/s) for D-T and He ash during the pulse. Pellet injection
   scenarios will help minimize tritium throughput. The in-device tritium
   inventory will be determined primarily by the cycle time of the
   divertor cryo-pumps, and can range from < 2 g for regeneration
   overnight to ~20 g for monthly regeneration. The confinement analysis
   based on ITER98(y,2) scaling indicates the importance of increasing the
   plasma current in FIRE to ~ 8 MA. This could be accomplished in the
   baseline design operated at 12 T for 12 s flattop. The design
   refinement of increasing the plasma shaping factor as in FIRE* is being
   evaluated along with the possibility of using only high conductivity
   (OFHC) copper in the TF coil. This lower strength material would
   require the addition of TF coil bucking on the central solenoid coils
   near the midplane. Initial results suggest that 11.5T could be produced
   with a flattop of 25 s using about 1/2 the electrical power required by
   the baseline BeCu TF coil. The limitation on burn time for both BeCu
   and OFHC TF coil designs is the power handling capability of plasma
   facing components and the vacuum vessel. A number of other important
   physics and engineering issues remain to be addressed during the
   remainder of the design study including generic issues such as:
   mitigation and avoidance of disruptions and vertical displacement
   events, effects of neoclassical tearing modes, detached divertor
   operation with good confinement, and divertor/edge plasma modeling
   under high power conditions. The FIRE design study is a U. S. national
   activity managed through the Virtual Laboratory for Technology and is
   supported by DOE. PPPL work is supported by DOE Contract #
