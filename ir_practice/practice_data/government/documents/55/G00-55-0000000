1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Satellite Situation Center (SSC)

   This center is an operational unit of the National Space Science Data
   Center (NSSDC), and NSSDC's international counterpart, World Data
   Center A for Rockets and Satellites (WDC-A-R&S). SSC personnel and
   software systems support NASA and international space physics
   activities by maintaining an ephemeris data base for scientific
   satellites in geocentric or heliocentric orbits which can be used to
   plan and support analysis of coordinated science observations by
   multiple satellites. NSSDC and the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF),
   which now provide software development support for SSC, are jointly
   managed by the Space Science Data Operations Office (SSDOO) at NASA
   Goddard Space Flight Center with primary contractor support from
   Raytheon STX Corporation.

   The SSC was established in the mid-1970's to support and coordinate
   multi-mission planning for the International Magnetospheric Study (IMS)
   [Teague et al., 1982]. SSC software resources developed during the IMS
   era continued to be used in mission and science planning for missions
   such as Dynamics Explorer 1 and 2 (DE 1/2), the International Sun-Earth
   Explorer series (ISEE 1, 2, and 3), and the Interplanetary Monitoring
   Platform series (IMP 7 and 8). The SSC supported the on-going series of
   Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop studies that began in 1978. In 1986
   SSC played a major planning and coordination role during the
   multi-mission Polar Region and Outer Magnetospheric International
   Studies (PROMIS) program. Later SSC similarly supported a joint mission
   of NASA (U.S.A), IKI (former Soviet Union), and ISAS (Japan) during
   1989-90 for coordinated observations with IKI's Active satellite under
   the aegis of the Inter-Agency Consultative Group (IACG), and the Solar
   Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP) during 1990-1994.

   Among the projects now supported by SSC are the NASA's Global Geospace
   Science (GGS)program, the International Solar Terrestrial Physics
   (ISTP)program, and the International Heliospheric Study (IHS).
   Precomputed state vector information, predictive or definitive, for the
   Geotail spacecraft is being provided by SSC to the IACG-WG3 (Working
   Group 3) satellite facility, called SPIN, at ISAS. Similar data will be
   provided to the Joint Science Operations Centre (JSOC) in the United
   Kingdom Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory for the Cluster mission and at
   the Experimenters Operations Facility (EOF) at GSFC for the SOHO
   mission.

   Updated orbital elements for many active satellites are routinely
   received electronically by SSC from the United States Space Command
   (USSPACECOM), previously known as NORAD. Elements for active satellites
   of interest to NASA-supported missions and international programs are
   processed by SSC staff into time-ordered Cartesian (X-Y-Z) coordinates,
   by using the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) code
   maintained at NASA Goddard's Flight Dynamics Division, and stored in a
   data base within the SSC Software System in NSSDC's Common Data Format
   (CDF) [Treinish and Gough, 1987]. The Cartesian data points are stored
   at maximum time resolution of one minute in geocentric inertial
   coordinates. The orbital element data can be accessed electronically
   through NASA Science Internet (NSI) at an anonymous FTP directory
   called ACTIVE. The Cartesian data are available via the SSC Software
   System as described below.

   The software and hardware capabilities of SSC have evolved over many
   years since the first generation of SSC programs was written in FORTRAN
   to run on a MODCOMP IV/25 computer for production of simple reports and
   data listings. In 1975, an interactive graphics system was added for
   preconfigured plots of key orbital parameters. In 1985, the software
   was ported to a MODCOMP Classic II/45 computer after previous updates
   and additions in 1980 in support of the Dynamics Explorer mission. More
   recent upgrades have included ports to more powerful computers in the
   SUN/UNIX environments and the addition of new magnetic field models
   [Peredo et al., 1992] and the revision of definitions for
   magnetospheric regions. Whereas user queries were exclusively handled
   by SSC staff prior to spring 1993, the emergence of the SSC Software
   System into the NSI network environment now makes possible direct
   access to SSC software and data by the space science community. The
   lastest development in this area has been the creation of a World Wide
   Web interface to the SSC. Now anyone with access to the internet and a
   browser can utilize the user friendly Graphical User Interface of their
   browser to access the SSC database.

1.2 SSCWeb Software System

   The SSC Software System is based on models of the Earth's
   magnetospheric regions and magnetic field, and programs generate
   information listings and trajectory plots for purposes of planning
   spacecraft instrument operations and/or data analysis. These programs
   identify the time periods during which a specified spacecraft is in a
   particular magnetospheric region or is in magnetic conjunction with
   other spacecraft or ground stations; allow a choice of internal and
   external magnetic field models for field-line tracing options
   (Internal, IGRF; External, Tsyganenko); plot spacecraft trajectories,
   illustrating spacecraft position relative to various magnetospheric
   regions; and perform conversions among geocentric and magnetic
   coordinate systems.

   An easy-to-use World Wide Web interface allows the user to quickly move
   from one part of the system to another, and to easily specify input
   parameters and options. The SSC software provides the user three (3)
   options for querying and viewing data available in an extensive
   database. These options, Query, Locator, and the database itself are
   described in the following sections.

   The main section of this User's Guide is organized to match the items
   presented to the user by the SSCWeb interface. Technical descriptions
   of the magnetic field models, magnetospheric region definitions, and
   coordinate systems used, as well as a list of usable ground stations,
   are given in Appendices A, B, C and D, respectively. Appendix E
   contains a glossary of terms used throughout the system itself and the
   documentation.

   User comments, suggestions and problem reports would be greatly
   appreciated. Please forward them to:

   SSC@sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov

1.3 Locator

   The Locator component of the SSC system allows the user to obtain
   location data in a tabular format. The user may request the
   spacecraft's location converted into a variety of coordinate systems
   (see section 5.0), as well as the following coordinate related items:
     * Latitude and longitude values of magnetic field line traces from
       the spacecraft location
     * The magnetospheric region in which the spacecraft resides
     * Radial distances from the Earth's center to the spacecraft (in Km
       or in RE, where RE=6378.16 Km)
     * Distances from the spacecraft to the:
          + bow shock
          + magnetopause
          + Fairfield's neutral sheet
     * The spacecraft's corresponding:
          + L value
          + magnetic field strength
          + invariant latitude.

1.4 Query

   The Query processor provides two query matching options, magnetospheric
   region occupancy and magnetic field line tracing. The region setup
   option provides magnetospheric region occupancy by listing the entry
   and exit times in which specified satellite(s) were in particular
   magnetospheric regions. The trace setup option provides the means to
   perform field line tracing queries to identify either periods when one
   or more spacecraft are on the same magnetic flux tube of force as a
   specified lead spacecraft, or periods when one or more spacecraft
   occupy a field line which traces down to a specified ground station.

   At intervals equal to the time between successive ephemeris data
   points, the ephemeris information of each spacecraft is used to
   evaluate the magnetic field vector at the position of the spacecraft.
   Next, the sampling point is moved in the direction of the vector to
   reach a neighboring point along the tube where the local field vector
   specifies the direction of the next step. This process is then iterated
   until finally the footpoint of the tube is reached. The magnetospheric
   models available for field line tracing are listed in Appendix A.

   To facilitate complex queries, the user can specify up to nine
   conditions under which a single query may be made. A condition consists
   of satellite selections, region specifications, and field line tracing
   options. PLEASE NOTE that the condition number is located at the top of
   the screen. The trace model selection, as well as the start and stop
   times, are used throughout all conditions.

   The main screen of the Query Interface requires selection of at least
   one satellite for processing from a scrolling list of available
   satellites, and entry of the start and stop times for satellite
   processing.

   Query also contains fields for specifying whether the satellites, time
   ranges and setups will apply to the current condition, to all of the
   conditions, or to any of the conditions. These conditions may be
   queried independently, or together.

   Several models are available to independently specify the terrestrial
   (internal) magnetic field and the magnetospheric (external) magnetic
   field. The size of the magnetic flux tube can also be specified as
   either a bin of x-deg latitude by y-deg longitude or a circular tube of
   a specified radius.

1.5 Extensive Database

   Updated predictive and definitive ephemeris for approximately
   fourty-five (45) satellites are maintained at the Satellite Situation
   Center. The ephemeris data is calculated from orbital elements using
   software provided by the Flight Dynamics Division at Goddard Space
   Flight Center. Time and position over specific time periods at varying
   resolutions are stored for each satellite. The orbital elements
   themselves are not currently stored in the database. This database is
   updated periodically with ephemeris for new satellites or revised
   ephemeris for existing satellites.

1.6 Navigation Help for SSCWeb

   What follows below are some hints for using you're browser effectively
   to navigate through the SSCWeb.
     * DO NOT USE the browsers back and forward commands. The proper way
       to navigate these pages is to utilize the command menu located at
       the bottom of each page. As you enter information and move from
       page to page the information is stored in "hidden" fields that are
       part of the document but not displayed. Using the back and forward
       command supplied by your browser will result in these hidden fields
       not being updated and your input will be lost and/or your results
       incorrect!

     * Selecting multiple items in a scrolling list varies depending on
       the platform.
          + On Macintosh:
               o Holding down the Shift key will select everything between
                 the item selected and the previous item selected.
               o Holding down the Command key will allow you to select
                 several items that are not adjacent to one another.
          + On Windows:
               o Holding down the Shift key will select everything between
                 the item selected and the previous item selected.
               o Holding down the Alt key will allow you to select several
                 items that are notadjacent to one another.
          + On Unix:
               o Select multiple items by selecting them one at a time.
     * Using the Help Window
          + It is best to use a frames enable version of a browser. With
            frames there will be a small portion of the screen where help
            text will be displayed. You will be able to get help on any
            item that is marked as a link on the SSCWeb Form. Please be
            aware of the following to make using help easier.
               o You can modify the size of the help window by "grabbing"
                 the bar between the frames and moving it in the desired
                 direction.
               o Using the browsers"Back" command has different result
                 from browser to browser and even between the same browser
                 on different platforms. So once again we advise, Do Not
                 Use the browsers"Back" and "Forward" commands.
     * If you switch to the ADVANCED interface your input from the
       STANDARD interface will still be valid. We have tried to
       accommodate switching from the Advanced to the Standard interface
       but the results may not be what you expect. Any options you
       selected in ADVANCED interface will still apply to any query you
       submit but will not be editable from the STANDARD interface.
