   Welcome to the NonProfit Gateway homepage, a one-stop site for finding
   federal government information of particular relevance to nonprofit
   organizations. The Gateway has been created so that nonprofit groups
   can efficiently locate information from across many different federal
   departments and agencies using a single, central online location.
   The current version of the Gateway site you are viewing is a prototype
   version. As you will discover, some sections of our site are not yet
   complete, but we hope that the information included so far is useful.
   Your comments and suggestions would be appreciated.
