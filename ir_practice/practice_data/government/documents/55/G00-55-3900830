   BestPractices
      Welcome!

      BestPractices, a program of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
      Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT), works with industry to
      identify plant-wide opportunities for energy savings and process
      efficiency. Through the implementation of new technologies and systems
      improvements, companies across the United States are achieving
      immediate savings results. We invite you to get involved in
      BestPractices so your company can join the ranks of forward-thinking
      U.S. industrial manufacturers who are saving energy and money, reducing
      pollution and emissions, and increasing productivity right now.

      Solicitations

      OIT awards cost-shared funding for R&D projects through a competitive
      solicitation process. Projects are performed by collaborative
      partnerships and must address industry-specified priorities. In this
      way, OIT maintains a balanced portfolio of R&D projects that will help
      realize national goals for energy and the environment.
