               TO ECOLOGY'S NEW POLLUTION PREVENTION (P2) WEB

     The purpose of this web site is to provide you with inspiration and
   information about some of the steps that we here at Ecology are taking
      to prevent pollution to the air, water and land within our state
   through source reduction.  You'll find information about the activities
   of our pollution prevention staff, other P2 projects going on under our
      roof, and some good reading and web sites that can help us all to
                 reduce toxic chemicals in our environment.
