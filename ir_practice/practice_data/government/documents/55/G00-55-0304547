   ATDD is currently running RAMS operationally for the East Tennessee
   Valley providing twice daily (00Z and 12Z) 24 hour forecasts.  RAMS is
   configured with three nested grids with grid spacings of 60, 15, and 5
   km respectively.  In the next few weeks output from the RAMS model will
   be provided on the ATDD web site.  Attached is an example of
   ground-level temperatures for Oct 18, 2000 at 00Z.
