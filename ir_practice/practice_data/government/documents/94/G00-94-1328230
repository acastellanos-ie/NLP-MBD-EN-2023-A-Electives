Notes top

   This site provides thermochemical, thermophysical, and ion energetics
   data compiled by NIST under the Standard Reference Data Program.

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) uses its best
   efforts to deliver a high quality copy of the Database and to verify
   that the data contained therein have been selected on the basis of
   sound scientific judgment. However, NIST makes no warranties to that
   effect, and NIST shall not be liable for any damage that may result
   from errors or omissions in the Database.

   The WebBook was developed in part with funds from the Systems
   Integration for Manufacturing Applications (SIMA) program at NIST.
