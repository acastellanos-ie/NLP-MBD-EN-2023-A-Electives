Mission and Background

   Fundamental Biology (FB) is NASA's agency-wide program for the study of
   fundamental biological processes through space flight and ground-based
   research. The program has three primary goals:

    Effectively use microgravity and the other characteristics of the
   space environment to enhance our understanding of fundamental
   biological processes
    Develop the scientific and technological foundations for a safe,
   productive human presence in space for extended periods and in
   preparation for exploration
    Apply this knowledge and technology to improve our nation's
   competitiveness, education, and quality of life on Earth.

  Our New Name

   Originally known as Gravitational Biology and Ecology, the name was
   changed to Fundamental Biology in early 2000 to better reflect the core
   mission and increasing breadth of this wide-ranging, inherently
   interdisciplinary program.

   The new name reflects the changing shape of modern biology. We have
   increased our emphasis on cell and molecular biology and developmental
   biology, as well as on the growing disciplines of evolutionary biology
   and genomics.

   FB will participate in the expanded range of space missions the Agency
   will undertake in the future. These include the International Space
   Station, planetary probes, surface studies, sample returns, and
   planetary bases.
