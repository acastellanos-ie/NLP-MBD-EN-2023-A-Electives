   As busy women living complex lives, we are sometimes overwhelmed by the
   amount of health information and misinformation in the media and on the
      Internet. This web page has been designed by the National Women's
     Health Information Center (NWHIC) to provide women with information
    they can trust about how to stay well and feel good about ourselves.
                              Consider these facts:
     * Fewer than 60% of women engage in physical activity on a regular
       basis.
     * One out of five Americans order take-out food every day.
     * In a 1996 survey, 56% of women and 43% of men disliked their
       overall appearance.
     * More than ninety percent of people with eating disorders are women.

    As we try to maintain good health, it is important to concentrate on
        both our mental health and our physical health. We must also
    concentrate on our body image and self-confidence. Society's pressure
   on women to look a certain way can lead to a sense of failure and even
   depression. Fashion models weigh 23% less than the average female, yet
      many men and women still consider the underweight body type to be
    normal and healthy. Now, more than ever, there are many organizations
     geared towards teaching women to appreciate the differences in our
               bodies and take charge of our health every day.

     The National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) has designed
   this page to provide information for women who would like to learn how
   to improve their health, start a physical activity program, eat better,
   learn about eating disorders, and learn about total mind/body wellness.
    By clicking on the above buttons, you will find information from the
     federal government and other approved sources. These resources are
   designed to encourage all of us, as women, to become educated about our
               bodies and minds to improve our overall health.
