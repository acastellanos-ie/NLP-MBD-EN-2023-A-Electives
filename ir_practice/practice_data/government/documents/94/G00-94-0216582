   MyTradeNet is your own personalized version of the Export Advisor.
   After entering some simple information, MyTradeNet allows you to
   collect your favorite parts of Export Advisor all into one place. You
   can choose whatever you want to see as bookmarks such as country
   specific information, trade leads, industry specific information and
   much more. Anything that is on the site can be easily added to your
   personalized page, updated automatically each time you return. It's
   kind of like your own butler bringing you your favorite sections of the
   newspaper and telling you about your mail and appointments for the day.
   Should you opt not to set up your page with categories and links, the
   Export Advisor will automatically bring to your page the most popular
   links in the entire site.
