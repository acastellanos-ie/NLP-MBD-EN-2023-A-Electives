                         Arterial Operations Toolbox

   Contains information to help Traffic Engineers acquire the tools and
   available software packages to optimize their traffic signals and
   effectively operate their arterials. This is a virtual toolbox,
   pertinent information will continuously be added. Please refer to this
   tool box often.

   VIDEOS AND CD’S
   Arterial Signal Timing Video
   This Video will demonstrate the importance and benefits of maintaining
   optimized and current traffic signal timing plans and investing
   resources in traffic signal systems. The video will contain
   testimonials from those who have made the investment. For copies of
   this video and an accompanying tri fold brochure please contact

   EVALUATION OF Non-Intrusive Technologies For Traffic Detection

   Welcome to the "NIT" project website. The purpose of this website is to
   provide up-to-date results from the Minnesota DOT and FHWA's Evaluation
   of Non-Intrusive Technologies for Traffic Detection.

   The primary purpose of the NIT project is to disseminate study findings
   to traffic management and data collection practitioners around the
   country.

   What Have We Learned About Intelligent Transportation Systems?
   Chapter 3: Arterial Management (2000)

   This document is an excerpt from a compendium report that looks back on
   the ten years of the National ITS Program to examine which ITS
   technology applications have been successful, which have not been
   successful, and what are the underlying factors that determine success
   versus failure.  This particular section examines arterial management
   systems, such as adaptive traffic signal control, traveler information
   about conditions on arterial streets, automated red light running
   enforcement and traffic signal preemption for emergency vehicles.
