   Earth's bow shock represents the outermost boundary between that region
   of geospace which is influenced by Earth's magnetic field and the
   undisturbed interplanetary medium streaming from the Sun. This boundary
   is important because it is here that the streaming solar wind is
   slowed, heated, and partially deflected around the Earth's
   magnetosphere. From solar wind observations, we know there exist
   rotational and tangential discontinuities, current sheets, magnetic
   holes and clouds , many of which eventually impact the Earth's
   magnetosphere with first contact at the bow shock. There are also any
   number of small scale structures, inhomogeneities, or perturbations
   present in the solar wind which hit the bow shock. As solar wind
   structures or changes in the solar wind impinge on the bow shock, it
   moves in response.

   We have put together a database of Geotail bow shock crossings during
   1995, 1996 and 1997. 1995 is the year in which Geotail switched from
   its deep tail mission to come in to an approximately 30 Re orbit ripe
   for studying magnetospheric boundaries. These years include the end of
   the descending phase, solar minimum and the start of the ascending
   phase of the solar cycle. We have concentrated on the crossings at the
   bow shock flanks because it is here that more motion and wave activity
   is expected - the nose is more tightly locked into place while the
   flanks can flap in the breeze.

   In addition J. Safrankova and Z. Nemecek supplied two years worth -
   1995, 1996 - of Magion-4 (Interball-Tail's sub satellite) bow shock
   crossings (approximately 1100 crossings). This orbit is highly
   elliptical and significantly out of the ecliptic plane.

  PRIMARY RESOURCES

   Web access to the database was set up to facilitate statistical studies
   and cross-comparisons of the Earth's bow shock. This database stores a
   list of bow shock crossings as well as information associated with each
   crossing - solar wind parameters such as Magnetosonic Mach number,
   plasma beta, IMF Bx, By, Bz, model theta _Bn, and ram pressure

   The database design allows plots to be created for specific subsets of
   the database, the conditions specifying the subset supplied through the
   WWW-based interface. Current supported plots include:

   identification of events, although some of this data is now "citable
   with caution". Users are encouraged to contact the appropriate
   Principal Investigator(s) if interested in using the data.
