   Since its founding in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation, the FBI has
   evolved into one of the most respected and sophisticated law
   enforcement agencies in the world. As the primary investigative arm of
   the Federal Government, the FBI is responsible for enforcing over 260
   federal statutes and for conducting sensitive national security
   investigations. These responsibilities include investigations into
   organized crime, white collar crime, economic crimes, public
   corruption, financial crime, fraud against the government, bribery,
   copyright matters, civil rights violations, bank robbery, financial
   institution fraud, extortion, kidnaping, air piracy, terrorism, foreign
   counterintelligence, interstate criminal activity, fugitive and drug
   trafficking matters, and other violations of federal statutes. The FBI
   also provides services for other law enforcement agencies which include
   fingerprint identification, laboratory services, police training, and
   the National Crime Information Center (NCIC).
   If you do not believe your complaint would be handled by the FBI or
