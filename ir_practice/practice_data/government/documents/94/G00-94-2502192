        Walden Named Vice-Chairman of the House Resources Committees
                       Subcommittee on Water and Power

   WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Congressman Greg Walden (R-OR) was appointed
   yesterday (10/9) as Vice-Chairman of the House Resources Committees
   Subcommittee on Water and Power by Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert
   (R-CA).  The vice-chairmanship had been vacated by Congressman George
   Radanovich (R-CA) who recently was appointed Chairman of the
   Subcommittee on Parks, Recreation and Public Lands.

   Its a significant honor to be chosen as Vice-Chairman of the
   Subcommittee on Water and Power, said Walden.  I am eager to roll up my
   sleeves and use the profile this new responsibility provides to further
   heighten the awareness among my colleagues on a host of critical issues
   in the Pacific Northwest that Ive been working on.  From the dire
   situation in the Klamath Basin and the real possibility that other
   basins could soon face the same tragedy, to the Bonneville Power
   Administration and energy generation issues across the Pacific
   Northwest, theres a lot at stake.  Ensuring reliable water for
   agriculture and Endangered Species Act requirements simultaneously, and
   protecting our regions energy production and prices are difficult
   issues.  But I will remain diligent in my efforts to inform my
   colleagues of their vital nature to our region.  I look forward to
   continuing the outstanding relationship I enjoy with Chairmen Hansen
   and Calvert.

   House Resources Committee Chairman James V. Hansen said, I congratulate
   Chairman Calvert on his decision to appoint Congressman Walden to serve
   as the new vice-chairman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power.
   Congressman Walden will make an excellent vice chairman. He has an
   impressive grasp of water and power issues, which are perhaps the most
   complex issues under the Resource Committee's jurisdiction. He is
   committed to protecting and sustaining our nations water and power,
   while ensuring the American people that we will get through this energy
   crisis. I look forward to his outstanding contribution.

   House Resources Committees Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert stated, I
   am pleased to welcome Congressman Walden as my vice-chairman of the
   Subcommittee on Water and Power.  I look forward to his contributions
   given his active role in subcommittee issues in the past, including his
   tireless work throughout the Klamath Basin crisis, and look forward to
   working with him.

   Congressman Walden has served on the Subcommittee on Water and Power
   since his election to Congress in 1998.  In addition, in January of
   this year Walden was one of only two Republican second-term lawmakers
