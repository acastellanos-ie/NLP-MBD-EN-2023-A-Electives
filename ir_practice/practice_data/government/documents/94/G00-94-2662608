   1999-07-12 Introduction l Goal: Providing IP to cellular phones and
   making IP- telephony as speech service economical feasible compared to
   the traditional circuit switched solution. Mobile Base Base Mobile
   Terminal Station Station Terminal Cellular Cellular Link Link Wired
   Network Header Compression over Cellular Links 2 Lars-Erik Jonsson,
   1999-07-12 Characteristics of cellular links l High bit-error-rate
   (BER). A BER of 10 -3 -10-2 is not uncommon. l Large round-trip time
   (RTT). In today's systems, RTTs may be as large as 200 ms. l Expensive
   bandwidth, meaning that every saved octet per packet is important.

   1999-07-12 CRTP evaluation - Conclusions: l CRTP performs very well for
   BERs less than 10 -5, but not so well for BERs higher than 10 -4. l The
   major cause of CRTPs bad performance is that many packets are discarded
   due to context damage while waiting a link round-trip time for the
   repair mechanism. l The losses induced by CRTP is problematic not only
   because they are high. Also the loss patterns are inappropriate and
   will certainly cause noticeable voice degradation. l If only packets
   with errors in the header part are discarded by the link layer, the
   loss rate will decrease by 40%. Header Compression over Cellular Links
   7 Lars-Erik Jonsson, 1999-07-12 Requirements for a new header
   compression scheme l Compressed headers must not be larger than with
   CRTP, and compression should be optimized as much as possible. l The
   scheme must be robust against loss before as well as after the
   compression point. l Implementation and computation simplicity are less
   important. Summarizing: The scheme must have highest possible
   COMPRESSION EFFICIENCY while still providing a certain amount of
   ROBUSTNESS against link errors. Header Compression over Cellular Links
   8 Lars-Erik Jonsson, 1999-07-12 RObust Checksum-based header
   COmpression , ROCCO: Main principles l Heavily geared towards local
   de-compressor context repairs. l Can reliably detect successful repairs
   through a header compression CRC computed over the header before
   compression. l A basic framework is specialized for specific kinds of
   links and packet streams through the use of "profiles". uRequires
   mechanisms for Separation, Identification and Classification of
   different flows. Header Compression over Cellular Links 9 Lars-Erik
   Jonsson, 1999-07-12 RObust Checksum-based header COmpression , ROCCO:
   An IP-telephony profile for cellular links l Additional compressed
   header information is included in a way maximizing the compression
   efficiency based on the assumed IP-telephony usage of RTP. l Our
   profile for IP telephony expects steady increments in the RTP sequence
   number and has a robust encoding of the differences from that behavior
   in the compressed header. l Compressed header format: 0 9 10 14 15
   Header Compresion CRC Sequence Code X Extension Payload uHeader
   Compression CRC is a 10-bit CRC computed over the original packet
   header. uThe Sequence-Code corresponds to the robust encoding mentioned
   above. Header Compression over Cellular Links 10 Lars-Erik Jonsson,

   Lars-Erik Jonsson, 1999-07-12 Conclusions l CRTP is an appropriate and
   general header compression scheme over reliable links and when many
   different RTP streams are intermixed. l ROCCO-based solutions on the
   other hand can outperform CRTP and may be needed to make IP telephony
   economically feasible over cellular links. Header Compression over

   Lars-Erik Jonsson, 1999-07-12 An ideal header compression scheme l
   Introduced and defined for comparison purposes. l Performs like CRTP
   would do if used over error-free links to compress input data without
   irregular changes in its header fields. l Characteristics of the scheme
   are: uThe compressed header is always two octets. uNo packets are lost
   due to context damage. uDe-compressor context do not need to be
   initialized. Header Compression over Cellular Links 16 Lars-Erik

   the scopes of the header compression framework and the compression
   profiles. l Improve the IP-telephony profile for cellular links with
   for instance a more efficient way to handle CSRC lists. l Study how
   separation and characterization of flows can be done. l Find suitable
   ways to negotiate the use of compression profiles. l Specify a
