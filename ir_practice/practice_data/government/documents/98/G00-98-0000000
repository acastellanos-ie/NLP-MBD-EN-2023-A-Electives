   The 15K clone is being made available through designated research
   centers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan.
     * Press Release from National Institute on Aging (NIA),National
       Institutes of Health (NIH).

   Characteristics of NIA 15K Mouse cDNA Clone Set
     * ~15,000 "unique" cDNA clones were rearrayed among 52,374 ESTs from
       pre- and periimplantation embryos, E12.5 female gonad/mesonephros,
       and newborn ovary.
     * Up to 50% are derived from novel genes.
     * ~1.5 kb average insert size.
     * Clones were sequenced from 5' and 3' termini to obtain longer reads
       and verify sequence  [new.gif] . Sequence information is available
       at this Web Site. Clone names are from H3001A01 to H3159G07.
     * Handling of NIA 15k cDNA Clone Set(June3, 2000)
     * Only individual Source Clones are available from ATCC. To obtain
       Source Clone, Please search our database using either the rearrayed
       clone name or GenBank accession number at our "Key Word Search
       page". Follow the link to the sequence information page for the
       rearrayed clone to obtain source clone ATCC number. Clicking the
       ATCC number will bring up the ATCC ordering page for the source
       clone.

   Terms and Conditions
    1. The name of the set will be NIA Mouse 15K cDNA clone set and,
       correspondingly, NIA Mouse 15K cDNA Microarray. Future sets
       expanding the cohort in units of 15K will be named accordingly (NIA
       30K cDNA clone set, etc.) and distributed as ready.
    2. Distribution will take place to about 10 designated locations
       world-wide. The centers who receive sets of clones have agreed to
       redistribute them to at least 8 other groups ("end-users") on
       demand as a condition of acceptance. These centers would have to
       notify us of redistributions, but there is no requirement for our
       permission or approval. End-users are allowed to produce and
       distribute microarrays, but are not permitted to redistribute the
       NIA 15K clone set.
    3. The conditions for the distribution of the microarrays and/or clone
       sets are as follows:

                Distribution schedules will be determined by the centers
                and subsequent end users. All centers and end users will
                be allowed to charge nominal fees in order to recover
                costs of materials,shipping and handling.
                Each center and end-user should keep an updated record of
                who has received clone sets/microarrays, and should
                provide us a copy, addressed to
                cdna@lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov.
                Researchers are encouraged to visit our Web Site to obtain
                all publicly available expression information about the
                genes.
                Researchers have an obligation to deposit their data in a
                public repository ( NCBI, EBI, GXD, or NIA), which will
                redistribute them to others. The timing of deposit can
                vary from immediate to no later than publication of
                derivative results.
                No control will be exerted on how the clones and
                microarrays are used. However, to ensure that data
                obtained with the clones are cumulative for all publicly
                available efforts, the individual names of clones must be
                maintained in any report and in database entries. It would
                also be preferable for the NIA set to be treated as such;
                no clones should be substituted in the NIA array, and when
                single or multiple clones are rearrayed with others, they
                must retain their names and be credited to the NIA set.
                Whenever clones are used in reports, our original paper
                should be cited (Tanaka et al., PNAS 97, 9127-9132). Use
                of the clone set and microarrays, and reports of results,
                does not involve any collaboration or require any
                coauthorship of manuscripts by NIA staff members.


   Academic Centers/Laboratories for distribution of NIA 15K clone set

   Note: Please do not request Individual cDNA clones from ATCC or the
   centers listed here.
     Also, please be advised that these Centers will be able to provide
   NIA 15K sets to only limited numbers of additional sites.
     Shipping of the clone set to the Centers will be completed by the end
   of May 2001
