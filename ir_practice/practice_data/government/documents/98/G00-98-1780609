     __________________________________________________________________

   The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has compiled measurements of
   water-surface elevation for Great Salt Lake since 1875. The north part
   of the lake has been monitored since April 1966.

   Currently two gages are used to monitor the lake level. The gages are
   located at the boat harbor at Saltair Beach State Park (south part,
   since October 1938), and at the Little Valley boat harbor northwest of
   Saline (north part, since April 1966). A third gage was operated at
   Promontory Point (south part) from October 1986 to September 1999. The
   elevation of the lake is recorded every 15 minutes and the data are
   transmitted to a satellite every 4 hours. These data are captured by a
   satellite downlink and entered into the USGS computer system. Mean
   daily elevations are computed and made available to the public. Wind
   and seiche effects may cause substantial short-term changes in
   elevations, which are not shown in the mean daily values.

   Great Salt Lake differs in elevation between the south and north parts.
   The Union Pacific Railroad causeway divides the lake into two parts.
   The water-surface elevation of the south part of the lake is usually
   0.5 to 2 feet higher than that of the north part because most of the
   inflow to the lake is to the south part.

   Note: Discrepancies in the lake elevations led to revisions of the base
   datum and the water-level record from April 16, 1984, to April 30,
   2001. The Great Salt Lake Datum Correction has a detailed explanation
   of these corrections.

   The USGS has compiled measurements of water-surface elevation for Great
   Salt Lake since 1875 and conducted many studies on the hydrology,
   salinity, water quality, and ecology of the lake. Currently, the USGS
   operates elevation gages at Saltair Marina, Saline (north part), and on
   Promontory Point (south part). The USGS is studying the ecology of
   brine shrimp in the lake in cooperation with the Utah Division of
   Wildlife Resources and researchers from the Department of Fisheries and
   Wildlife at Utah State University.
