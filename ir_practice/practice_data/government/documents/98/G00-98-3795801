   you may shelter in Any of the facilities providing you have access.
   Notice: Two (2) hours prior to launch, when conditions (wind, etc.) are
   not favorable, announcements will be made over the Cape Aural Warning
   System for personnel to "identify their launch shelter now." This is
   the cue for you to locate the closest shelter and ensure that it is
   open and accessible. * If you have a documented RESPIRATORY PROBLEM you
   should shelter in the Port area Greenhouse, or the Dockmaster facility
   if the Greenhouse is closed. Facility Managers: Upon catastrophic
