   APPEALS TO DAB

   HHS Departmental Appeals Board Information



      A respondent may request a hearing on the PHS finding of research
      misconduct and/or the PHS administrative actions before the HHS
      Departmental Appeals Board (DAB). The request must be made to the DAB
      within 30 days of receipt of the ORI final report and notification
      letter that contains the finding and administrative actions. A DAB
      hearing is conducted by a DAB member or an administrative judge and two
      scientists. During a hearing, the respondent may be represented by
      counsel and may file motions and pleadings, make legal arguments,
      request discovery, present and cross examine witnesses, submit
      evidence, and participate in the hearing. ORI relies heavily on the
      cooperation of the involved institutions in obtaining witnesses,
      documents, and other assistance in presenting its case before the DAB.


      If the DAB rules in favor of the respondent, the misconduct finding
      will be overturned and the proposed administrative actions will not
      take effect. DAB rulings on propose debarments are subject to final
      approval by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grants and Acquisition
      Management (DASGAM), the debarring official for HHS. If the misconduct
      findings and administrative actions are affirmed by the DAB (and DASGAM
      in cases of debarment), they take effect immediately. Whatever the
      outcome a final notification letter is sent to the institution where
      the investigation was conducted and to the current employing
      institution if the respondent has relocated. See other close out
      procedures under ORI Decision and PHS Decision.
