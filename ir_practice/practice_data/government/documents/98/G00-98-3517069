   [acsi.gif] The Clean Streams Program is a broad-based
   citizen/industry/government program working to eliminate acid mine
   drainage from abandoned coal mines. Using a combination of private and
   governmental resources, the Program facilitates and coordinates citizen
   groups, university researchers, the coal industry, corporations, the
   environmental community, and local, state, and federal government
   agencies that are involved in cleaning up streams polluted by acid
   drainage. Begun as an initiative in 1994, this successful program has
   funded 77 projects in 10 states.
