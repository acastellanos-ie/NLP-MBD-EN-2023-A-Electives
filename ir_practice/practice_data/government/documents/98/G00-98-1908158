   The Hanford Groundwater Monitoring Project, managed by the U.S.
   Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, provides
   integrated site-specific and site-wide assessments of groundwater
   quality on the Hanford Site through groundwater sampling and analysis
   and computer modeling.

   The Ground-Water Surveillance Project is part of the Hanford site
   Environmental Surveillance Program, which is designed to satisfy the
   following program objectives, as identified in DOE Order 5400.1:
     * verify compliance with applicable environmental laws and
       regulations
     * verify compliance with environmental commitments made in
       environmental impact statements, environmental assessments, safety
       analysis reports, or other official DOE documents
     * characterize and define trends in the physical, chemical, and
       biological condition of the environment
     * establish baselines of environmental quality
     * provide a continuing assessment of pollution abatement programs
     * identify and quantify new or existing environmental quality
       problems

   In addition, limited vadose zone monitoring at selected priority sites
   is conducted to determine if vadose zone contamination is migrating to
   groundwater.

   The Hanford seismic monitoring network is also operated to quantify the
   location and nature of seismic events in the Hanford region.
