   Hazardous waste is a growing problem in King County, Washington and
   around the world. The Local Hazardous Waste Management Program in King
   County is an intensive effort to reduce and properly manage that waste
   through education, collection and technical assistance. It offers a
   variety of services to King County, Washington small businesses and
   citizens. Services include two telephone hotlines, mobile and fixed
   collection sites, shop visits to businesses, the Industrial Materials
   Exchange (IMEX) and the Hazardous Waste Library. The program is a
   cooperative effort among several local agencies in the Puget Sound,
