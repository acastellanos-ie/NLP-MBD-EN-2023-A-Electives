      National Summit on Medical Errors and Patient Safety Research

   Research Agenda: Medical Errors and Patient Safety
        __________________________________________________________________

      In response to the Institute of Medicine's report on medical errors, To
      Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System, President Clinton asked
      the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force (QuIC) to draft a
      response that outlines the Federal government's existing programs and
      plans to address the issues of medical errors and patient safety.

      Among the actions proposed in the QuIC's response, Doing What Counts
      for Patient Safety: Federal Actions to Reduce Medical Errors and Their
      Impact, was a National Summit on Medical Errors and Patient Safety
      Research. The research agenda from the summit follows.
        __________________________________________________________________

                               Introduction / Agenda

   Introduction

      The National Summit was a 1-day meeting held in Washington, DC, on
      September 11, 2000. It solicited responses from the users of patient
      safety research about their pressing needs, and to highlight specific
      research questions related to those needs. Twenty-four users of medical
      errors/patient safety research were invited to testify orally about
      their research questions, and about 35 other users submitted written
      testimony. Many of those testifying or submitting written testimony
      represented leading professional organizations, patient advocacy
      groups, institutional providers, and health care purchasers.

      To ensure that the users' input led to a coordinated private-public
      action plan by funders of patient safety research, representatives from
      14 public- and private-sector organizations that fund patient safety
      research were asked to listen to the oral statements on September 11
      and to read the written testimony. After receiving this input from the
      users, the representatives met to develop an integrated, coordinated,
      user-driven, patient-focused, system-based patient safety research
      agenda for all 14 organizations. Although each of the funding
      organizations may have a different focus of interest within the
      overarching agenda and may prioritize their individual research agendas
      differently, all agreed that the overall issues for patient safety
      research were captured in the outlined research agenda.

      Given the extent of both the users' comments as well as of the patient
      safety field, the research agenda is rather broad in scope. Future
      discussions and meetings will be scheduled to provide more detail for
      the current research framework.

      In trying to organize the research issues as we strive for the safest
      possible healthcare system, it became clear to the funders that the
      most logical structure was based on the timing and priority of the
      various research objectives. Therefore, each of the specific research
      aims was separated into one of three categories: short- (6 months to 2
      years), medium- (just over 2 years to 5 years), and long-term (over 5
      years).

      Short-term projects are those for which the users expressed their most
      pressing needs, and address issues that are currently inhibiting their
      ability to move forward. Such research projects may extend past the
      outlined time period, but the main objective would be to begin those
      projects immediately. Medium-term projects may require some initial
      funding for planning and start-up, but the full benefit of the research
      results will require the use of information from some of the short-term
      projects. The objectives of the long-term projects will be met only if
      the results of a few preliminary short- and medium-term projects are
      used to develop the long-term research plans.

      This patient safety research agenda is only a research agenda. As a
      research agenda, it is not meant to capture other aspects of the
      patient safety issue (e.g., legislative and legal issues) that should
      also be addressed to allow the patient safety effort to move forward.
      The research agenda could help formulate proper responses to obvious
      policy dilemmas, but it is intended to be a part of, not the complete
      solution to, patient safety issues.

      The QuIC plans to convene other meetings to allow for input into and
      guidance concerning these research priorities.

      Epidemiology of Errors

      Short Term:
        * What are the barriers, opportunities, and incentives to studying
          errors in nonhospital settings and what are the best strategies to
          address such barriers?

      Medium Term:
        * What are the types of errors? (e.g., failure to diagnose,
          human/machine interaction, medication-related)
        * Are there differences in the types or rates of errors in settings
          other than acute care?
        * Who are at risk for particular kinds of errors? [Suggested groups
          for study include patients who are terminally ill; mentally ill;
          diagnosed with chronic diseases or disabling conditions; are
          children (particularly newborns under 5 lbs.); have limited English
          proficiency and low health literacy; are women, low income
          individuals, members of minority groups, individuals requiring
          end-of-life care, or urban/rural residents.]
        * What is the relationship of the health of workers to patient
          safety?
        * What are particular system vulnerabilities that lead to an
          increased occurrence of medical errors?

      Long Term:
        * How do we know which outcomes are caused by error, rather than by
          underlying disease or disabling condition?
        * What human factors lead to error?
        * What are typical clinician-patient interaction problems?
        * How can human / technology interaction be made safer?
        * How do system complexities effect the ability to improve safety?

   Infrastructure to Improve Patient Safety

   Short Term:
     * What are the proper roles for different interest groups in
       promoting patient safety?
       Point of care (Patients and providers who have direct interaction
       with each other are the initial research dyad.)
       Environment or context in which care is delivered (Purchasers,
       legislatures, organization leaders, oversight bodies such as
       accreditors and boards, State programs, courts, licensure and
       accrediting bodies)
     * How can the efforts of disparate parties involved with patient
       safety be coordinated?
     * What should be the common vocabulary (errors, adverse events
       definitions, typology, data standards)?

   Medium Term:
     * What analytic capacity needs to be developed?
     * What infrastructure is needed?
     * How can data be integrated?
     * How can we best develop talent to perform analysis and
       interventions?

   Information Systems

   Short Term:
     * What makes a reporting system successful?
     * What useful data sources exist?
     * What can we learn from existing systems?
     * What data should be collected and how?
     * Can we develop a common definition of a "reporting system" or what
       data is most useful for which purposes? For example, should reports
       primarily focus on errors, injuries, "incidents," risk factors, or
       safety practices? Who should submit those reports? Should it be
       providers, hospitals or organizations, patients, manufacturing
       companies, and/or administrative bodies? How should the data be
       collected? Should it be by compiling routinely collected
       surveillance data on indicators of possible errors, performing a
       medical record review, or conducting surveys? How should be
       classify the types of errors (commission, omission, severity)?
     * How can privacy/confidentiality be assured?
     * What legislation facilitates/hinders reporting?
     * What infrastructure is needed to support data collection, analysis
       and use?

   Medium Term:
     * How does one collect information on omissions of care?
     * How can data be clustered to facilitate analysis?
     * How do we measure success of the reporting systems?
     * In providing information to potential users, how can
       confidentiality and the need to inform be balanced?
     * How can we best develop infrastructure to support data collection,
       analysis, and use?

   Long Term:
     * How do we measure overall success of the reporting systems?
     * How can more complete data be collected?

       safety questions?
     * How can we maintain a patient-centered focus in research and
