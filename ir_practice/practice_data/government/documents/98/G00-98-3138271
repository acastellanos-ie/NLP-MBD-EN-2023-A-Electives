   Settlement Conferences
   Governing rule:
   ADR Local Rule 7.
   Goal:
   The goal of a settlement conference is to facilitate the parties
   efforts to negotiate a settlement of all or part of the dispute.
   See ADR LR 7-1
   Process:
   A judicial officer, usually a magistrate judge, helps the parties
   negotiate. Some settlement judges also use mediation techniques to
   improve communication among the parties, probe barriers to settlement
   and assist in formulating resolutions. Settlement judges might
   articulate views about the merits of the case or the relative strengths
   and weaknesses of the parties' legal positions. Often settlement judges
   meet with one side at a time, and some settlement judges rely primarily
   on meetings with counsel.
   See ADR LR 7-1
   Preservation of right to trial:
   The settlement judge has no power to impose settlement and does not
   attempt to coerce a party to accept any proposed terms. The parties may
   agree to a binding settlement. If no settlement is reached, the case
   remains on the litigation track. The parties' formal discovery,
   disclosure and motion practice rights are fully preserved.
   The neutral:
   A magistrate judge or, in limited circumstances, a district judge
   conducts the settlement conference. The judge who would preside at
   trial does not conduct the settlement conference unless the parties
   stipulate in writing and the judge agrees. Parties may request a
   specific magistrate judge or rank several magistrate judges in order of
   preference. The court will attempt to accommodate such preferences.
   Most magistrate judges have standing orders setting forth their
   requirements for settlement conferences, including written statements
   and attendance. Questions about these issues should be directed to the
   chambers of the assigned magistrate judge.
   See ADR LR 7-2

   Attendance:
   Settlement judges' standing orders generally require the personal
   attendance of lead trial counsel and the parties. The requirement is
   waived only when it poses a substantial hardship, in which case they
   are required to be available by telephone. Persons who attend the
   settlement conference are required to be thoroughly familiar with the
   case and to have authority to negotiate a settlement.
   See ADR LR 7-4
   Confidentiality:
   Communications made in connection with a settlement conference
   ordinarily may not be disclosed to the assigned judge or to anyone else
   not involved in the litigation, unless otherwise agreed.
   See ADR LR 7-5
   Timing:
   The assigned judge may refer a case to a magistrate judge for a
   settlement conference at anytime. The timing of the settlement
   conference depends on the schedule of the assigned magistrate judge.
   See ADR LR 7-4
   Written submissions:
   Written settlement conference statements, when required, are submitted
   directly to the settlement judge. The statements are not filed with the
   court.
   See ADR LR 7-4
   Appropriate cases/circumstances:
   All civil cases are eligible. Cases with the following characteristics
   may be particularly appropriate:
   [blueball.gif] a client or attorney prefers to appear before a judicial
   officer
   [blueball.gif] issues of procedural law are especially important
   [blueball.gif] a party is not represented by counsel
   See ADR LR 7-2
   Cost:
   There is no charge to the litigants.
