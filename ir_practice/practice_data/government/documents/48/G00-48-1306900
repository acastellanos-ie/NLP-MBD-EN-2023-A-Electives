   You may use FAFSA Corrections on the Web to complete and submit
   corrections to your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
   You may complete and transmit this online form electronically.

   If you are using FAFSA Corrections on the Web you should have received
   a Student Aid Report (SAR) in the mail. Please pay particular attention
   that the SAR you are referring to has the same transaction number you
   enter to correct via FAFSA Corrections on the Web in the upcoming
   screens. (If you are coming back to open incomplete corrections that
   you have saved previously then go to Open Saved FAFSA.)

   If you want to electronically sign a submitted form (whether paper or
   electronic) you need to have a PIN. If you have a PIN, select sign my
   application electronically.

   status of my application and print a copy of my signature page if

   of Education. If you do not have a PIN, or you need to request your PIN
   again, select Request My PIN.

   If you know your PIN, select the school year you wish to make
   corrections to and Next.
