   The Fountain Hills Marshals Department, led by Public Safety Director
   Steven Gendler, is the town's municipal law enforcement agency.

   The Fountain Hills Marshals department's enforcement philosophy is
   based on creating a safe and secure environment for our residents
   through voluntary compliance, impartial resolution of neighborhood
   disputes, a commitment to "quality of life" issues and timely law
   enforcement service.

   Police services are provided to our residents through a unique
   combination of both full-time officers and volunteer deputy Marshals as
   well as contracted services from the County Sheriff.

   The Marshals Department primarily handles "quality of life" issues such
   as municipal code enforcement, crime prevention, special events and
   community services. "Life and death" issues such as criminal
   investigations and traffic enforcement are provided by the County
   Sheriff under a contract administered by the Towns' Public Safety
   Director, Marshal Steve Gendler.
