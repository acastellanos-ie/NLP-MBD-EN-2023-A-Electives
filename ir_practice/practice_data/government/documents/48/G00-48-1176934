   The NIEHS has produced software for Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
   analysis since 1983. Originally, programs were written for the HP
   technical workstation that Varian supplied with their last
   spectrometers, but current programs are written for the IBM MS DOS, MS
   Windows, Win95, WinNT, and various UNIX workstation formats. This
   software is provided free to the EPR research community with the
   understanding that any resulting report either internally or externally
   distributed explicitly acknowledge this contribution.

   This software is most easily available via Internet using the following
