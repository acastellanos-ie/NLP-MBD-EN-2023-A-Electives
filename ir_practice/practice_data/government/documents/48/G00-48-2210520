   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a Member of Congress, represents the
   22nd District of Texas, which includes Brazoria, Fort Bend, and Harris
   Counties.
   Elected to the third highest leadership post in the House Republican
   Conference, as House Majority Whip, Congressman Tom DeLay is
   responsible for making certain that the Republican legislative agenda
   is completed. His role in the process is to "grow the votes" necessary
   to insure final passage of legislation. The Congressman's leadership
   and hard work paid off dividends when Republicans fulfilled their
   campaign promises with the successful conclusion of the "Contract with
   America."
   Congressman DeLay also serves on the powerful Appropriations Committee,
   the committee that produces all spending legislation for the House of
   Representatives. A committed fiscal conservative, he has worked hard to
   insure that every taxpayer's dollar is spent wisely and efficiently.
   By consistently voting to reduce federal spending, he has earned the
   "Taxpayers' Friend" award from the National Taxpayers Union. For his
   conservative voting record, he has received 100 percent ratings from
   The New American and the Christian Voice magazines. He has also
   received the Watchdog of the Treasury's "Golden Bulldog Award" and the
   coalition of Peace Through Strength's "National Security Leadership"
   award. He has also consistently received high marks for his
   pro-business stance from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   Congressman DeLay started his legislative career in 1978, when he
   became the first Fort Bend County Republican ever elected to the Texas
   House of Representatives. In 1984, he moved to the U.S. House of
   Representatives, where he has played an active leadership role. Before
   becoming Majority Whip, he served as Republican Conference Secretary,
   as Deputy Whip, and as Chairman of the Republican Study Committee.
   A native Texan, Congressman DeLay was born in Laredo in 1947. After
   attending Baylor University, he graduated from the University of
   Houston in 1970. He then owned and operated a small business in Texas.
   Active in civic affairs, he has helped raise funds for many charitable
   and community groups over the years with his unique auctioneering
   abilities. In keeping with he and his wife Christine's special interest
   in children and family-related issues, he serves on the Advisory Board
   of Child Advocates of Fort Bend County. He and Christine have one
   daughter, Danielle, who is a graduate of Texas A&M University. They are
   members of the First Baptist Church Sugar Land.
