   The U.S. Department of Commerces Technology Administrations public
   workshop on Understanding Broadband

   Demand: Digital Content and Rights Management will explore critical
   questions impacting the deployment and adoption of digital broadband
   content, identify appropriate government or private sector actions, and
   facilitate continuing dialogue and cooperation.

   Broadband networks-high-speed, high-capacity Internet access- promise
   to revolutionize our nation and our world. From our economy, to our
   education systems, from health care to entertainment, broadband
   networks hold the power to change the way we work, live, play and
   learn.

   As the technology communitys portal to federal government, we hope to
   shed light on digital content and rights management issues.
