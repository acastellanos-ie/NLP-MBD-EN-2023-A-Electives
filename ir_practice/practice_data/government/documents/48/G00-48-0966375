      GTE is primarily an aircraft-based program supplemented by ground-based
      measurements and satellite observations. The space shuttle observations
      of tropospheric carbon monoxide distribution by the MAPS instrument,
      for example, were important in the planning of expeditions over
      tropical rain forests (the GTE ABLE-2 mission), and the satellite
      observations of enhanced concentrations of ozone over the tropical
      Atlantic ocean were the focus of a major international study in Brazil
      and southern Africa (the GTE TRACE-A mission). Landsat surface images
      have also facilitated the extrapolation of regional arctic-tundra
      measurements into global-scale conclusions (the ABLE-3 mission), and
      weather data returned by environmental satellites have guided flight
      planning for research aircraft.

      Global observations from space will ultimately be the technique of
      choice for mapping the distributions of reactive, spatially variable
      chemical species. Aircraft experiments will in the future provide
      "ground truth" for satellite measurements and explore in detail the
      processes responsible for the observed distributions. GTE has already
      demonstrated the value of both approaches, although space observations
      are at present very sparse. In the future, instruments aboard
      polar-orbiting satellites of the Earth Observing System (EOS) will
      greatly expand the range of measurements available from space.
      Supported by the complementary techniques and measurements pioneered by
      GTE, a new generation of satellite instruments can gather the data
      required for a definitive understanding of global tropospheric change.

      Understanding the chemical processes in the troposphere on a global
      scale is critical if we are to predict, and potentially ameliorate,
      harmful man-made changes to the global environment. Guidance for the
      GTE field studies has come from ad hoc planning meetings, initiated in
      July 1984, and convened by the Manager of the Tropospheric Chemistry
      Program. Emerging from this first planning meeting was a recommended
      long range plan for a series of field studies to be conducted through
      the NASA Tropospheric Chemistry Program, and coordinated with other
      national and international studies. The recommended field measurements
      included studies of the tropical forest, Arctic tundra, instrument
      intercomparisons, global distributions, and long-range transport. Since
      the initial 1984 meeting, four other planning meetings have been
      convened to review and update this long range plan. The recommendations
      from these meetings have resulted in field studies of the Amazon Rain
      Forest and the northern latitude tundra (e.g. Atmospheric Boundary
      Layer Experiments, ABLE-2 and ABLE-3), evaluation of instrumentation
      for measurements of odd nitrogen and sulfur species (e.g. Chemical
      Instrument Test and Evaluation, CITE -1, -2 and -3), measurements over
      the tropical Atlantic (e.g. Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near
      the Equator- Atlantic, TRACE-A), and a series of studies over the
      Pacific ocean(e.g. Pacific Exploratory Mission, PEM-West phases A and B
      and PEM-Tropics).

      Participants in the series of ad hoc planning meetings, representing a
      broad cross section of the international atmospheric chemistry
      community are collectively the architects of the NASA GTE field
      programs. They include Drs. Daniel Albritton, Hajime Akimoto, Helmuth
      Bauer, Jack Calvert, Mary Anne Carroll, Ralph Cicerone, David Crosley,
      Robert Duce, Douglas Davis, Dieter Ehhalt, Fred Fehsenfeld, Jack
      Fishman, Robert Harriss, Daniel Jacob, Volker Kirchhoff, Pablo Lagos,
      Don Lenshow, Shaw Liu, Antony Mayer, Robert J. McNeal, Volker Mohnen,
      Luiz Molion, Jarvis Moyers, Reginald Newell, Stuart Penkett, Joyce
      Penner, John Ritter, Michael Rodgers, Sherry Rowland, Wolfgang Seiler,
      Hanwant Singh, Anne Thompson, and Steve Wofsy.
