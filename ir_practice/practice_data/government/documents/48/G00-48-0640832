   Investigator for the SkyView virtual observatory. SkyView allows
   astronomers and interested members of the public access to astronomical
   data over 18 decades in energy: 30 Mhz radio to 30 GeV gamma rays.
   Users simply select an object or position they are interested in and
   the wavelength regime the desire, and SkyView automatically produces an
   image from existing all-sky and large-area surveys.
