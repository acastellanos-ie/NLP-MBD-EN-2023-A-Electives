   The Space Plasma Physics Group at Marshall Space Flight Center in
   Huntsville, AL conducts experimental and theoretical research to
   support the engineering, scientific, and operational activities of the
   NASA Office of Space Flight and Office of Space Science.

   Our principal objective is to develop an understanding of the physical
   processes that control the geospace plasma environment and its
   interaction with both natural and man-made bodies in space. Our unique
   emphases are on the plasma that originates in the ionosphere, and its
   heating in auroral light displays. The heating causes plasma to escape
   from Earth's gravity, producing a plasma fountain, which in turn has
   been found to supply plasma to the acceleration regions that generate
   disruptive space plasma storms. The basic physics of moving plasmas,
   and their interactions with bodies in space, provide the fundamental
   basis for our research.
