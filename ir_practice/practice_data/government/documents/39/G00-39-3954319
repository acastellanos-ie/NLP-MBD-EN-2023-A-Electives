   Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics

LHEA Organization: An Overview

   The scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Laboratory for
   High Energy Astrophysics (LHEA), together with their colleagues in the
   community, observe some of the most extreme phenomena in the Universe.
   Some of the key areas addressed are:
     * The origin, evolution and physical environment of black holes
     * Extreme states of matter found in neutron stars and white dwarfs
     * The evolution of the Universe, including the formation of large
       scale structure
     * The nature of dark matter
     * The cause and effect of cosmic explosions including supernovae and
       gamma ray bursts
     * The acceleration of energetic particles to relativistic energies

   the laws of physics under extreme conditions not found on the Earth. To
   do this the LHEA scientists undertake a broad program of experimental
   and theoretical research associated with cosmic sources of X-rays,
   Gamma rays, cosmic rays and gravitational radiation. Instruments are
   designed, built, tested and flown on balloons, rockets and satellites.
   Laboratory scientists develop sensitive X-ray and gamma ray detectors
   and telescopes with particular emphasis on spectroscopy, and
   spectrometers for energetic particle studies. The resulting data are
   analyzed, archived and interpreted by the LHEA staff. A theoretical
   program emphasizes the fundamental physics involved, relying strongly
   on significant new developments in nuclear, high energy particle and
   plasma physics. The laboratory also provides leadership in the planning
   and development of future observatories, including the provision of
   project and study scientists to support the project office activities
   at GSFC. Collaborations with the national and international scientific
   communities are a common feature of the LHEA programs.

   responsible for administering the overall research program of the LHEA:
     * The X-ray Astrophysics Branch
     * The Gamma Ray and Cosmic Ray Astrophysics Branch.

   Two LHEA technical support branches and the other engineering divisions
   at GSFC provide engineering, software and administrative support.

   has overall responsibility for the archiving and supporting the
   utilization by the astrophysics community of X-ray and Gamma ray
   astronomy data. The OGIP includes the High Energy Astrophysics Science
   Archive Research Center (HEASARC) which has the responsibility for
   archiving data from all of NASA and many international EUV, X-ray and
   Gamma ray missions. The OGIP also contains dedicated Guest Observer
   Facilities that provide support to the community for the use of the
   data from individual missions.

   with 40 Goddard employees, with the remainder affiliated to USRA,
   University of Maryland (College Park and Baltimore County campuses),
   George Mason University, Johns Hopkins University and National Research
   Council Research Associates. An additional ~100 staff provide
   engineering, software and administrative support within the LHEA. About
   one third of these are Goddard employees, with the remainder from local
   contractors including Raytheon, Mentor and Swales.
