   Mission:
   The National Program Staff (NPS) is the principal organizational
   component of ARS which, in accordance with the ARS plan, assesses the
   full spectrum of scientific needs of the Agency, the resources
   available for reassignment, and program areas which lack resources or
   which should be terminated. The NPS develops, for the Administrator,
   options and recommendations for resource allocations and the Budget
   Division develops those selected into Departmental budget proposals.
   The NPS adjusts the ARS Six-Year Implementation Plan based on
   Executive, Congressional, and agency priorities. The NPS selects
   research programs to be implemented and recommends allocations of
   agency resources accordingly. This includes distribution of base funds,
   lapse salary funds, and program increases to research units.
