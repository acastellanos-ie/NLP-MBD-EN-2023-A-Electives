   General Information About ERIC
   [appleb2.gif] What is ERIC?

   The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) is a national
   information system designed to provide users with ready access to an
   extensive body of education-related literature. ERIC, established in
   1966, is supported by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of
   Educational Research and Improvement, and the National Library of
   Education.

   [appleb2.gif] How do I get to the education-related literature?

   Through the ERIC database, the world's largest source of education
   information. The database contains more than one million abstracts of
   education-related documents and journal articles. You can access the
   ERIC database on the Internet or through commercial vendors and public
   networks. You can also access ERIC abstracts in the print publications
   Resources in Education and Current Index to Journals in Education. ERIC
   updates the database monthly (quarterly on CD-ROM), ensuring that the
   information you receive is timely and accurate.

   [appleb2.gif] What training materials are available to teach others
   about ERIC?

   A wonderful training tool, the ERIC Slide Show can be downloaded into
   several formats for use in a presentation. A Pocket Guide to ERIC and
   All About ERIC are free handouts that can accompany the slide show;
   call ACCESS ERIC at 1800LETERIC (5383742) to order or send us an
   e-mail with your contact information and the number of copies you would
   like to receive.

   ERIC Database, Documents, and Journal Articles

   [appleb2.gif] How do I search the ERIC database online?

   Go to Search the Database for links to all the ERIC-sponsored access
   points and for detailed instructions for searching the ERIC database.

   [appleb2.gif] Where can I get the full-text of ERIC documents?

   If a publication has an ERIC Document (ED) number, you can find a copy
   at any one of the more than 900 libraries (search the ERIC Resource
   Collection to find the nearest collection to you) that have the ERIC
   microfiche collection, or you can purchase a microfiche or paper copy
   from the ERIC Document Reproduction Service (1800443ERIC), e-mail
   them, or order online. Online documents are available in Adobe Portable
   Document Format (PDF). For publications that are not available from
   ERIC, the abstract will include information on where you can obtain a
   copy.
   [appleb2.gif] Where can I get the full-text of ERIC journal articles?

   Copies of ERIC journal articles, which have EJ numbers in the ERIC
   database, can be found in library periodical collections or obtained
   through interlibrary loan, from the journal publisher, or from article
   reprint services such as Ingenta (online only) or ISI (18003364474).

   [appleb2.gif] How do I cite ERIC documents and journal articles?

   ERIC Documents are cited like books and ERIC Journal Articles are cited
   like journals; the exception is that the ERIC Number (beginning with ED
   or EJ) is specified at the end of the citation in parenthesis. For
   additional information and examples concerning ERIC Documents
   citations, please visit the AskERIC Web site.

   [appleb2.gif] Can I reproduce and distribute ERIC documents or journal
   articles?

   As government documents, ERIC Digests and other documents produced by
   ERIC are in the public domain and can be reproduced and distributed
   freely. Normal copyright restrictions, however, apply to articles or
   documents that were not published by an ERIC component. If you are
   uncertain about the copyright status of a particular publication
   abstracted in the ERIC database, call ACCESS ERIC at 1800LETERIC
   (5383742) or send us an e-mail with the publication's title, author,
   and ERIC Number and we will help you determine if copyright
   restrictions apply to the document in which you are interested.

   [appleb2.gif] How can I subscribe to the ERIC collection of full-text
   documents?

   Call the ERIC Document Reproduction Service (EDRS) at 18004433742 or
   send EDRS an e-mail for information on how to obtain the ERIC document
   collection.

   [appleb2.gif] How do I submit my article or document to the ERIC
   database?

   Send a copy of your article or document and a signed ERIC Reproduction
   Release Form to the ERIC Processing and Reference Facility or to the
   ERIC Clearinghouse that covers your topic. If you choose to submit your
   document directly to an ERIC Clearinghouse, please review the ERIC
   System Directory or call ACCESS ERIC at 1800LETERIC (5383742) to
   determine which clearinghouse processes documents in your topic area.
   For detailed information regarding article submission and selection
   criteria, view Submitting Documents to ERIC: Frequently Asked Questions
   or call the ERIC Processing and Reference Facility at 18007993742.

   ERIC Components

   [appleb2.gif] What are the ERIC Components?

   There are three types of ERIC Components that make up the ERIC System:
   ERIC Clearinghouses, ERIC Adjunct Clearinghouses, and ERIC Support
   Components. See below for a brief description of each of these
   components.

   [appleb2.gif] What do the ERIC Clearinghouses do?

   The ERIC Clearinghouses collect, abstract, and index education
   materials for the ERIC database; respond to requests for information in
   their subject specific areas; and produce special publications on
   current research, programs, and practices.

   [appleb2.gif] What do the Adjunct Clearinghouses do?

   Each Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse is associated with the ERIC
   Clearinghouse whose broader scope encompasses that of the adjunct.
   Adjuncts perform some or all of the following functions in their
   subject areas: identifying and acquiring significant literature within
   their scope area for the ERIC database, providing reference and
   referral services, providing technical assistance, maintaining or
   contributing to Web sites, and producing publications. They receive
   funding from sponsors outside of the ERIC system.

   [appleb2.gif] What do the Support Components do?

   ERIC Support Components produce, publish, and disseminate ERIC
   systemwide products and services.
