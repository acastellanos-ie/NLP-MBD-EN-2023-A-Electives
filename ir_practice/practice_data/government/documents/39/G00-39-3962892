                           Missouri K-16 Coalition
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. The Coordinating Board Resolution The Coordinating Board for Higher
   Education adopted the following resolution at its December 11, 1997
   meeting.

   Whereas, Missouris public elementary/secondary schools and two- and
   four-year colleges/universities are committed to high expectations and
   high performances for all students, and

   Whereas, a strong quality-focused, coordinated educational system is
   necessary to provide a secure future for Missouris citizens, and

   Whereas, student success is the joint responsibility not only of
   students, the community and the general public but also of faculty and
   administrators at all levels within the states educational system, and

   Whereas, there is a need for enhanced cooperation and communications
   within and across educational sectors that will result in increased
   student learning from kindergarten through postsecondary learning
   experiences,
     __________________________________________________________________

   Be it therefore, resolved that the Coordinating Board for Higher
   Education join together with the State Board of Education and the
   University of Missouri Board of Curators in a partnership that promotes
   seamless education initiatives under the structure of a K-16 Coalition.
   This coalition will be appointed jointly by the Commissioner of
   Education, the Commissioner of Higher Education, and the President of
   the University of Missouri. Membership on the K-16 Coalition will
   include business, educational, and legislative leaders with a
   commitment to and interest in promoting educational excellence for all
   Missourians.

   2. The Charge

   The Coordinating Board for Higher Education, the State Board of
   Education and the University of Missouri Board of Curators have formed
   a historic new partnership in support of high quality standards for all
   students in their pursuit of knowledge. Prominent Missourians committed
   to quality education at all levels have been appointed to the Missouri
   K-16 Coalition. Coalition members will work together in an effort to
   create a seamless education system and to raise expectations and
   performance levels of all students, from kindergarten through the
   baccalaureate degree.

   The coalition will work with all sectors of elementary, secondary, and
   higher education, both public and private. The coalition is initially
   being asked to concentrate on the important area of mathematics and to
   consider ways in which the success of Missouri students in mathematics
   can be increased. The focus will be on grades 11 and 12 and the first
   two years of higher education. The coalition is charged with:
     * Promoting quality performance standards
     * Encouraging faculty agreements on content and expectations in the
       major disciplines, beginning with mathematics
     * Increasing public awareness of the importance of improved student
       performance
     * Supporting full articulation within and across educational sectors
     * Identifying strategies for enhanced performance based upon
       preparation and ability
     * Developing policy recommendations to be shared with the
       Coordinating Board for Higher Education, the State Board of
       Education, and the UM Board of Curators

   Dr. Melvin D. George, President Emeritus of the University of Missouri,
   will chair the coalition. Additional projects beyond mathematics will
   be considered throughout the year. Educators and business and
   government leaders are joining together to make a difference for
   Missouris youth as they prepare for a future that will be filled with
   challenge and change.
