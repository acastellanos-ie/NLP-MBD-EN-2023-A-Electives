   Endricine Disruption in American Alligators. Environmental Contaminants
   are any physical, chemical, biological or radiological substance or
   matter that has an adverse effect on air, water, soil or living
   organisms.  The goal of the Ecotoxicology Program at the USGS Florida
   Caribbean Science Center is to identify sensitive toxic endpoints
   (biomarkers) and to evaluate the effects of environmental contaminants
   on vulnerable wildlife populations.

   Significant evidence suggests that exposure to a variety of
   environmental contaminants can alter the normal biological functions of
   the endocrine, reproductive, and immune systems in wildlife. Although
   many of the observed effects are sub lethal, problems such as impaired
   hormone production or activity; modified adult sexual behavior; and
   reduced fertility, hatchability of eggs, and survival of offspring can
   lead to substantial losses in wildlife populations.
   Endricine Disruption in Largemouth Bass. High concentrations of
   nutrients and pesticides from agriculture, effluents from industries
   and sewage treatment facilities, and chemical contamination resulting
   from human use and misuse are all avenues for exposure to environmental
   contaminants.
   One of the primary objectives of the Ecotoxicology Program is the
   development and application of  techniques to monitor subtle
   physiological alterations, such as changes in hormone concentrations
   and gonadal development, that may result from exposure to
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs).  The following are among methods
   currently being used:
     * surveys to identify potential environmental contaminants and their
       effects on a variety of wildlife species, including invertebrates,
       fish, reptiles, and mammals;
     * controlled field experiments to evaluate direct and
       multigenerational effects of EDCs;
     * investigations to document mechanisms of toxicity and their
       biological and ecological  relevance; and
     * analytical procedures and expertise provided to other research and
       regulatory programs within USGS, DOI, and partner agencies.
