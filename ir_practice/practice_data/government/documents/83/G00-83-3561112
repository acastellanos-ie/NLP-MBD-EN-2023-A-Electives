   marriages (a) Whenever, in the consideration of any claim filed by a
   per- son as the widow or widower of a veteran for gratuitous death ben-
   efits under laws administered by the Secretary, it is established by
   evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that such person, without
   knowledge of any legal impediment, entered into a marriage with such
   veteran which, but for a legal impediment, would have been valid, and
   thereafter cohabited with the veteran for one year or more immediately
   before the veteran's death, or for any period of time if a child was
   born of the purported marriage or was born to them before such
   marriage, the purported marriage shall be deemed to be a valid
   marriage, but only if no claim has been filed by a legal widow or
   widower of such veteran who is found to be entitled to such benefits.
   No duplicate payments shall be made by virtue of this subsection. (b)
   Where a surviving spouse has been legally married to a vet- eran more
   than once, the date of original marriage will be used in determining
   whether the statutory requirement as to date of mar- riage has been
   met. (c) In determining whether or not a person is or was the spouse of
   a veteran, their marriage shall be proven as valid for the purposes of
   all laws administered by the Secretary according to the law of the
   place where the parties resided at the time of the mar- riage or the
   law of the place where the parties resided when the right to benefits
   accrued. (d)(1) The remarriage of the surviving spouse of a veteran
   shall not bar the furnishing of benefits to such person as the
   surviving spouse of the veteran if the remarriage is void, or has been
   an- nulled by a court with basic authority to render annulment decrees
   unless the Secretary determines that the annulment was secured through
   fraud by either party or collusion. (2) The remarriage of the surviving
   spouse of a veteran shall not bar the furnishing of benefits specified
   in paragraph (5) to such person as the surviving spouse of the veteran
   if the remarriage has been terminated by death or divorce unless the
   Secretary deter- mines that the divorce was secured through fraud or
   collusion. (3) If the surviving spouse of a veteran ceases living with
   an- other person and holding himself or herself out openly to the
   public as that person's spouse, the bar to granting that person
   benefits as the surviving spouse of the veteran shall not apply in the
   case of the benefits specified in paragraph (5). 17 CH. 1-GENERAL ยง 105
   (4) The first month of eligibility for benefits for a surviving spouse
   by reason of this subsection shall be the month after- (A) the month of
   the termination of such remarriage, in the case of a surviving spouse
   described in paragraph (2); or (B) the month of the cessation described
   in paragraph (3), in the case of a surviving spouse described in that
   paragraph. (5) Paragraphs (2) and (3) apply with respect to benefits
   under the following provisions of this title: (A) Section 1311,
   relating to dependency and indemnity compensation. (B) Section 1713,
   relating to medical care for survivors and dependents of certain
   veterans. (C) Chapter 35, relating to educational assistance. (D)
   Chapter 37, relating to housing loans. (e) The marriage of a child of a
   veteran shall not bar recogni- tion of such child as the child of the
   veteran for benefit purposes if the marriage is void, or has been
   annulled by a court with basic authority to render annulment decrees
   unless the Secretary deter- mines that the annulment was secured
   through fraud by either party or collusion. (P.L. 85857, Sept. 2, 1958,

   title) for a child over the age of eighteen years and under the age of
   twenty-three years who is attending a school, college, academy,
   seminary, tech- nical institute, university, or other educational
   institution, the Sec- retary may approve or disapprove such educational
   institutions. (b) The Secretary may not approve an educational
   institution under this section unless such institution has agreed to
   report to the Secretary the termination of attendance of any child. If
   any educational institution fails to report any such termination
   prompt- ly, the approval of the Secretary shall be withdrawn. (P.L.

   Line of duty and misconduct (a) An injury or disease incurred during
   active military, naval, or air service will be deemed to have been
   incurred in line of duty and not the result of the veteran's own
   misconduct when the per- son on whose account benefits are claimed was,
   at the time the in- jury was suffered or disease contracted, in active
   military, naval, or air service, whether on active duty or on
   authorized leave, un- less such injury or disease was a result of the
   person's own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. Venereal
   disease shall not be presumed to be due to willful misconduct if the
   person in service complies with the regulations of the appropriate
   service depart- ยง 106 CH. 1-GENERAL 18 ment requiring the person to
   report and receive treatment for such disease. (b) The requirement for
   line of duty will not be met if it ap- pears that at the time the
   injury was suffered or disease contracted the person on whose account
   benefits are claimed (1) was avoiding duty by deserting the service or
   by absenting himself or herself without leave materially interfering
   with the performance of mili- tary duties; (2) was confined under
   sentence of court-martial in- volving an unremitted dishonorable
   discharge; or (3) was confined under sentence of a civil court for a
   felony (as determined under the laws of the jurisdiction where the
   person was convicted by such court). (c) For the purposes of any
   provision relating to the extension of a delimiting period under any
   education-benefit or rehabilitation program administered by the
   Secretary, the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism shall not be
   considered to be the result of willful misconduct. (P.L. 85857, Sept.

   active service (a)(1) Service as a member of the Women's Army Auxiliary
   Corps for ninety days or more by any woman who before October 1, 1943,
   was honorably discharged for disability incurred or aggra- vated in
   line of duty which rendered her physically unfit to perform further
   service in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps or the Wom- en's Army Corps
   shall be considered active duty for the purposes of all laws
   administered by the Secretary. (2) Any person entitled to compensation
   or pension by reason of this subsection and to employees' compensation
   based upon the same service under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5

   and has reported pursuant to the call of the per- son's local draft
   board and before rejection; or (3) who has been called into the Federal
   service as a mem- ber of the National Guard, but has not been enrolled
   for the Federal service; and who has suffered an injury or contracted a
   disease in line of duty while en route to or from, or at, a place for
   final acceptance or entry upon active duty, will, for the purposes of
   chapters 11, 13, 19, 21, 31, and 39 of this title, and for purposes of
   determining service-connection of a disability under chapter 17 of this
   title, be considered to have been on active duty and to have incurred
   such disability in the active military, naval, or air service. (c) For
   the purposes of this title, an individual discharged or released from a
   period of active duty shall be deemed to have con- 19 CH. 1-GENERAL ยง
   107 tinued on active duty during the period of time immediately fol-
   lowing the date of such discharge or release from such duty deter-
   mined by the Secretary concerned to have been required for that
   individual to proceed to that individual's home by the most direct
   route, and in any event that individual shall be deemed to have
   continued on active duty until midnight of the date of such dis- charge
   or release. (d)(1) For the purposes of this title, any individual- (A)
   who, when authorized or required by competent au- thority, assumes an
   obligation to perform active duty for train- ing or inactive duty
   training; and (B) who is disabled or dies from an injury or covered
   dis- ease incurred while proceeding directly to or returning directly
   from such active duty for training or inactive duty training, as the
   case may be; shall be deemed to have been on active duty for training
   or inactive duty training, as the case may be, at the time such injury
   or cov- ered disease was incurred. (2) In determining whether or not
   such individual was so au- thorized or required to perform such duty,
   and whether or not such individual was disabled or died from injury or
   covered disease so incurred, the Secretary shall take into account the
   hour on which such individual began so to proceed or to return; the
   hour on which such individual was scheduled to arrive for, or on which
   such indi- vidual ceased to perform, such duty; the method of travel
   em- ployed; the itinerary; the manner in which the travel was per-
   formed; and the immediate cause of disability or death. (3) Whenever
   any claim is filed alleging that the claimant is entitled to benefits
   by reason of this subsection, the burden of proof shall be on the
   claimant. (4) For purposes of this subsection, the term ``covered
   disease'' means any of the following: (A) Acute myocardial infarction.
   (B) A cardiac arrest. (C) A cerebrovascular accident. (e) Each person
   who has incurred a disability as a result of an injury or disease
   described in subsection (b) shall be entitled to the same rights,
   privileges, and benefits under title 5 as a preference eligible
   described in section 2108(3)(C) of title 5. (f) Service as a member of
   the Alaska Territorial Guard during World War II of any individual who

   dollar limitations in the law specifying such annual income shall apply
   at a rate of $0.50 for each dollar. (c) In the case of benefits under

   prescribe, medical, surgical, and dental treatment, hospital care,
   transportation and traveling expenses, prosthetic ap- pliances,
   education, training, or similar benefits authorized by the laws of such
   nation for its veterans, and services required in ex- tending such
   benefits. Hospitalization in a Department facility shall not be

   Secretary may also pay the court costs and other expenses incident to
   the proceedings taken for the commitment of ยง 110 CH. 1-GENERAL 22 such

   services in private, State, and other Government hospitals. (3) All
   amounts received by the Department as reimbursement for such services
   shall be credited to the current appropriation of the Department from
   which expenditures were made under this subsection. (b) Persons who
   served in the active service in the armed forces of any government
   allied with the United States in World War II and who at time of
   entrance into such active service were citizens of the United States
   shall, by virtue of such service, and if otherwise qualified, be
   entitled to the benefits of chapters 31 and 37 of this title in the

   person who has applied for and received the same or any similar benefit
   from the government in whose armed forces such person served. (c)(1)

   authenticated certification from the French Ministry of Defense or the
   British War Office as to records in either such Office which clearly
   indicate military serv- ice of the applicant in the Czechoslovakian or

   Payments or allowances for beneficiary travel (a) Under regulations
   prescribed by the President pursuant to the provisions of this section,
   the Secretary may pay the actual necessary expense of travel (including
   lodging and subsistence), or in lieu thereof an allowance based upon
   mileage traveled, of any person to or from a Department facility or
   other place in connection with vocational rehabilitation, counseling
   required by the Secretary pursuant to chapter 34 or 35 of this title,
   or for the purpose of ex- amination, treatment, or care. In addition to
   the mileage allowance authorized by this section, there may be allowed
   reimbursement for the actual cost of ferry fares, and bridge, road, and
   tunnel tolls. (b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this
   section and notwithstanding subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section or any
   other provision of law, if, with respect to any fiscal year, the
   Secretary exercises the authority under this section to make any
   payments, the Secretary shall make the payments provided for in this
   section to or for the following persons for travel during such fiscal
   year for examination, treatment, or care for which the person is
   eligible: (A) A veteran or other person whose travel is in connection
   with treatment or care for a service-connected disability. (B) A
   veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or
   more. (C) A veteran receiving pension under section 1521 of this
   title.(D) A veteran (i) whose annual income (as determined under
   section 1503 of this title) does not exceed the maximum annual rate of
   pension which would be payable to such veteran if such veteran were
   eligible for pension under section 1521 of this title, or (ii) who is
   determined, under regulations pre- scribed by the Secretary, to be
   unable to defray the expenses of the travel for which payment under
   this section is claimed. (E) Subject to paragraph (3) of this
   subsection, a veteran or other person whose travel to or from a
   Department facility is medically required to be performed by a special
   mode of travel and who is determined under such regulations to be un-
   able to defray the expenses of the travel for which payment under this
   section is claimed. (F) A veteran whose travel to a Department facility
   is inci- dent to a scheduled compensation and pension examination. (2)
   The Secretary may make payments provided for in this sec- tion to or
   for any person not covered by paragraph (1) of this sub- section for
   travel by such person for examination, treatment, or care. Such
   payments shall be made in accordance with regulations which the
   Secretary shall prescribe. ยง 111 CH. 1-GENERAL 24 (3)(A) Except as
   provided in subparagraph (B) of this para- graph, the Secretary shall
   not make payments under this section for travel performed by a special
   mode of travel unless (i) the travel by such mode is medically required
   and is authorized by the Sec- retary before the travel begins, or (ii)
   the travel by such mode is in connection with a medical emergency of
   such a nature that the delay incident to obtaining authorization from
   the Secretary to use that mode of travel would have been hazardous to
   the person's life or health. (B) In the case of travel by a person to
   or from a Department facility by special mode of travel, the Secretary
   may provide pay- ment under this section to the provider of the
   transportation by special mode before determining the eligibility of
   such person for such payment if the Secretary determines that providing
   such pay- ment is in the best interest of furnishing care and services.
   Such a payment shall be made subject to subsequently recovering from
   such person the amount of the payment if such person is deter- mined to
   have been ineligible for payment for such travel. (c)(1) Except as
   otherwise provided in this subsection, the Sec- retary, in making a
   payment under this section to or for a person described in subparagraph
   (A), (B), (C), or (D) of subsection (b)(1) of this section for travel
   for examination, treatment, or care, shall deduct from the amount
   otherwise payable an amount equal to $3 for each one-way trip. (2) In
   the case of a person who is determined by the Secretary to be a person
   who is required to make six or more one-way trips for needed
   examination, treatment, or care during the remainder of the calendar
   month in which the determination is made or during any subsequent
   calendar month during the one-year period fol- lowing the last day of
   the month in which the determination is made, the amount deducted by
   the Secretary pursuant to para- graph (1) of this subsection from
   payments for trips made to or from such facility during any such month
   shall not, except as pro- vided in paragraph (5) of this subsection,
   exceed $18. (3) No deduction shall be made pursuant to paragraph (1) of
   this subsection in the case of a person whose travel to or from a
   Department facility is performed by a special mode of travel for which
   payment under this section is authorized under subsection (b)(3) of
   this section. (4) The Secretary may waive the deduction requirement of
   paragraph (1) of this subsection in the case of the travel of any vet-
   eran for whom the imposition of the deduction would cause severe
   financial hardship. The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations the
   conditions under which a finding of severe financial hardship is
   warranted for purposes of this paragraph. (5) Whenever the Secretary
   increases or decreases the rates of allowances or reimbursement to be
   paid under this section, the Sec- retary shall, effective on the date
   on which such increase or de- crease takes effect, adjust
   proportionately the dollar amounts speci- fied in paragraphs (1) and
   (2) of this subsection as such amounts may have been increased or
   decreased pursuant to this paragraph before such date. (d) Payment of
   the following expenses or allowances in connec- tion with vocational
   rehabilitation, counseling, or upon termination 25 CH. 1-GENERAL ยง 111
   of examination, treatment, or care, may be made before the comple- tion
   of travel: (1) The mileage allowance authorized by subsection (a) of
   this section. (2) Actual local travel expenses. (3) The expense of
   hiring an automobile or ambulance, or the fee authorized for the
   services of a nonemployee attendant. (e) When any person entitled to
   mileage under this section re- quires an attendant (other than an
   employee of the Department) in order to perform such travel, the
   attendant may be allowed ex- penses of travel upon the same basis as
   such person. (f) The Secretary may provide for the purchase of printed
   re- duced-fare requests for use by veterans and their authorized at-
   tendants when traveling at their own expense to or from any De-
   partment facility. (g)(1) In carrying out the purposes of this section,
   the Sec- retary, in consultation with the Administrator of General
   Services, the Secretary of Transportation, the Comptroller General of
   the United States, and representatives of organizations of veterans,
   shall conduct periodic investigations of the actual cost of travel (in-
   cluding lodging and subsistence) to beneficiaries while traveling to or
   from a Department facility or other place pursuant to the provi- sions
   of this section, and the estimated cost of alternative modes of travel,
   including public transportation and the operation of pri- vately owned
   vehicles. The Secretary shall conduct such investiga- tions immediately
   following any alteration in the rates described in paragraph (3)(C) of
   this subsection, and, in any event, immediately following the enactment
   of this subsection and not less often than annually thereafter, and
   based thereon, shall determine rates of al- lowances or reimbursement
   to be paid under this section. (2) In no event shall payment be
   provided under this section- (A) unless the person claiming
   reimbursement has been determined, pursuant to regulations which the
   Secretary shall prescribe, to be unable to defray the expenses of such
   travel (except with respect to a person receiving benefits for or in
   con- nection with a service-connected disability under this title, a
   veteran receiving or eligible to receive pension under section 1521 of
   this title, or a person whose annual income, deter- mined in accordance
   with section 1503 of this title, does not ex- ceed the maximum annual
   rate of pension which would be pay- able to such person if such person
   were eligible for pension under section 1521 of this title); (B) to
   reimburse for the cost of travel by privately owned vehicle in any
   amount in excess of the cost of such travel by public transportation
   unless (i) public transportation is not rea- sonably accessible or
   would be medically inadvisable, or (ii) the cost of such travel is not
   greater than the cost of public trans- portation; and (C) in excess of
   the actual expense incurred by such person as certified in writing by
   such person. (3) In conducting investigations and determining rates
   under this section, the Secretary shall review and analyze, among other
   factors, the following factors: (A)(i) Depreciation of original vehicle
   costs; ยง 112 CH. 1-GENERAL 26 (ii) gasoline and oil costs; (iii)
   maintenance, accessories, parts, and tire costs; (iv) insurance costs;
   and (v) State and Federal taxes. (B) The availability of and time
   required for public trans- portation. (C) The per diem rates, mileage
   allowances, and expenses of travel authorized under sections 5702 and
   5704 of title 5 for employees of the United States. (4) Before
   determining rates or adjusting amounts under this section and not later
   than sixty days after any alteration in the rates described in
   paragraph (3)(C) of this subsection, the Secretary shall submit to the
   Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the
   Senate a report containing the rates and amounts the Secretary proposes
   to establish or continue with a full justification therefor in terms of
   each of the limitations and factors set forth in this section. (h) The
   Secretary, in consultation and coordination with the Secretary of
   Transportation and appropriate representatives of vet- erans' service
   organizations, shall take all appropriate steps to fa- cilitate the
   establishment and maintenance of a program under which such
   organizations, or individuals who are volunteering their services to
   the Department, would take responsibility for the trans- portation,
   without reimbursement from the Department, to Depart- ment facilities
   of veterans (primarily those residing in areas which are geographically
   accessible to such facilities) who seek services or benefits from the
   Department under chapter 17 or other provisions of this title. (P.L.

   of deceased veterans, dis- charged under honorable conditions, by
   preparing and sending to eligible recipients a certificate bearing the
   signature of the Presi- dent and expressing the country's grateful

   of a certificate to one eligible recipient will not preclude
   authorization of another cer- tificate if a request is received from

   benefit is paid.(3) In implementation of a sequestration order or law
   with re- spect to each account from which a benefit described in
   paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection is paid (including the making
   of deter- minations of the amounts by which such benefits are to be re-
   duced), the total of the amounts (as estimated by the Secretary after
   consultation with the Director of the Congressional Budget Office) by
   which payments of such benefit will be reduced by reason of such
   paragraph after the last day of the period during which such order or
   law is in effect shall be deemed to be additional re- ductions in the
   payments of such benefit made, and in new budget authority for such
   payments, during such period. (d) In computing the amount of new budget
   authority by which a budget account of the Department is to be reduced
   for a fiscal year under a report of the Director of the Office of
   Management and Budget, or under an order of the President under part C
   of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the
   base from which the amount of the reduction for such account is
   determined shall be established without regard to any amount of new
   budget authority in such account (determined under section 251(a)(6) of
   such Act) for any of the programs listed in subsection (a) of this
   section. (e) This section applies without regard to any other provision
   of law (whether enacted before, on, or after the date of the enact-
   ment of this section) unless such Act expressly provides that it is
   enacted as a limitation to this section. (f) For the purposes of this
   section: (1) The term ``sequestration'' means a reduction in spend- ing
   authority and loan guarantee commitments generally throughout the
   Government under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act
   of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) or any other law. (2) The term
   ``sequestration law'' means a law enacted with respect to a
   sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
   Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) or any other law (under the
   procedures specified in that Act or otherwise). (3) The term
   ``sequestration order'' means an order of the President issued under
   part C of such Act. (Added P.L. 99576, ยง 601(a)(1), Oct. 28, 1986, 100

   into a multiyear contract for the procurement of supplies or services
   if the Secretary makes each of the following determinations: (1)
   Appropriations are available for obligations that are necessary for
   total payments that would be required during the fiscal year in which
   the contract is entered into, plus the esti- 29 CH. 1-GENERAL ยง 114
   mated amount of any cancellation charge payable under the contract. (2)
   The contract is in the best interest of the United States by reason of
   the effect that use of a multiyear, rather than one- year, contract
   would have in- (A) reducing costs; (B) achieving economies in contract
   administration or in any other Department activities; (C) increasing
   quality of performance by or service from the contractors; or (D)
   encouraging effective competition. (3) During the proposed contract
   period- (A) there will be a continuing or recurring need for the
   supplies or services being procured; (B) there is not a substantial
   likelihood of substantial changes in the need for such supplies or
   services in terms of the total quantity of such supplies or services or
   of the rate of delivery of such supplies or services; and (C) the
   specifications for the supplies or services are expected to be
   reasonably stable. (4) The risks relating to the prospective
   contractor's ability to perform in accordance with the specifications
   and other terms of the contract are not excessive. (5) The use of a
   multiyear contract will not inhibit small business concerns in
   competing for the contract. (6) In the case of the procurement of a
   pharmaceutical item for which a patent has expired less than four years
   before the date on which the solicitation of offers is issued, there is
   no substantial likelihood that increased competition among po- tential
   contractors would occur during the term of the contract as the result
   of the availability of generic equivalents increas- ing during the term
   of the contract. (b)(1) A multiyear contract authorized by this section
   shall contain-(A) a provision that the obligation of the United States
   under the contract during any fiscal year which is included in the
   contract period and is subsequent to the fiscal year during which the
   contract is entered into is contingent on the avail- ability of
   sufficient appropriations (as determined by the Sec- retary pursuant to
   paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection) if, at the time the contract is
   entered into, appropriations are not available to cover the total
   estimated payments that will be re- quired during the full term of the
   contract; and (B) notwithstanding section 1502(a) of title 31, a
   provision for the payment of reasonable cancellation charges to com-
   pensate the contractor for nonrecurring, unrecovered costs, if any, if
   the performance is cancelled pursuant to the provision required by
   subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. (2)(A) If, during a fiscal year
   after the fiscal year during which a multiyear contract is entered into
   under this section, the Sec- retary determines that, in light of other
   funding needs involved in the operation of Department programs, the
   amount of funds appro- priated for such subsequent fiscal year is not
   sufficient for such ยง 115 CH. 1-GENERAL 30 contract, the Secretary
   shall cancel such contract pursuant to the provisions required by
   paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection. (B) Cancellation charges under a
   multiyear contract shall be paid from the appropriated funds which were
   originally available for performance of the contract or the payment of
   cancellation costs unless such funds are not available in an amount
   sufficient to pay the entire amount of the cancellation charges payable
   under the contract. In a case in which such funds are not available in
   such amount, funds available for the procurement of supplies and serv-
   ices for use for the same purposes as the supplies or services pro-
   cured through such contract shall be used to the extent necessary to
   pay such cost. (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to
   restrict the Secretary's exercise of the right to terminate for
   convenience a contract under any other provision of law which
   authorizes multiyear contracting. (d) The Secretary shall prescribe
   regulations for the implemen- tation of this section. (e) For the
   purposes of this section: (1) The term ``appropriations'' has the
   meaning given that term in section 1511 of title 31. (2) The term
   ``multiyear contract'' means a contract which by its term is to remain
   in effect for a period which extends beyond the end of the fiscal year
   during which the contract is entered into but not beyond the end of the
   fourth fiscal year following such fiscal year. Such term does not
   include a con- tract for construction or for a lease of real property.
   (3) The term ``nonrecurring, unrecovered costs'' means those costs
   reasonably incurred by the contractor in performing a multiyear
   contract which (as determined under regulations prescribed under
   subsection (d) of this section) are generally incurred on a one-time
   basis. (Added P.L. 100322, ยง 404(a), May 20, 1988, 102 Stat. 545;

   sections 314, 315, 316, and 2406 of this title and subchapter I of
   chapter 81 of this title, the Secretary may acquire and use real
   property- (1) before title to the property is approved under section
   355 of the Revised Statutes (40 U.S.C. 255); and (2) even though the
   property will be held in other than a fee simple interest in a case in
   which the Secretary determines that the interest to be acquired is
   sufficient for the purposes of the intended use. (Added P.L. 10286, ยง

   report that is required by law or by a joint 31 CH. 1-GENERAL ยง 116
   explanatory statement of a committee of conference of the Con- gress,
