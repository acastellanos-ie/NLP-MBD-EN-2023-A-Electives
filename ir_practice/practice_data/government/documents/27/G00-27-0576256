                          OOPS! We have a problem here...

      Our web server was unable to find the web page you hoped to visit. This
      doesn't mean that it isn't here somewhere, maybe we moved it, or maybe
      you have a typo in the address (check it and please make sure you type
      it in lower-case), or maybe there are just gremlins running around in
      the system. If it isn't a typo, here's what to do now.

      1.  If you were looking for one of the following pages click on it to
      go to the new location on our web site:
        * 2001 Consumer Action Handbook (formerly the Consumer's Resource
          Handbook)
        * Small Business Publications
        * Patent Information
        * Trademark Information
        * Kid's page

      2.  Visit our Home Page (www.pueblo.gsa.gov) and see an overview of
      what our site has to offer.

      3.  If you're in a hurry, type in your search criteria below. It will
      then show all the related titles matching your query, and display a
      link to take you  to that page.
