   Traveler Briefing
   Travel and Safety Tips
   Photo of Administrator Garvey

   Welcome to the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) travel
   information web site. This site is designed to provide you with the
   most up-to-date information when preparing to travel by air in the
   United States or overseas.
   Air travel continues to be the safest, most efficient mode of
   transportation in the United States. The FAA, along with the airlines
   and aircraft manufacturers, is responsible for aviation safety. Yet,
   you the traveler, have an important role in making your journey as safe
   and comfortable as possible.
   Who Does What
   The Department of Transportation (DOT) oversees consumer issues such as
   denied boarding, lost baggage, overbooking, ticketing, as well as
   statistics on on-time performance. The FAA is responsible for civil
   aviation safety, including security, developing safety regulations, and
   certifying pilots and aircraft.  The FAA operates the nation's air
   traffic control system and through the world wide web provides
   real-time flight delay information.

   Connecting to Useful Information
   This site includes direct, one-click links to the DOT and the airlines,
   as well as a host of other useful sites such as airports, the
   Department of State, safety and enforcement statistics, the Centers for
   Disease Control and U.S. Customs Service.
   I hope this web site answers all of your questions about travelling by
   air. However, if you cant find the information you need, at the end of
   this site you can pose your questions directly to the FAA via e-mail. I
   am committed to having all of your questions answered as soon as
   practical.
   Thank you for visiting the FAAs passenger information web site and have
   a safe trip!
   Jane F. Garvey

   Your Trip

   What to Wear
   Passengers who wear sensible clothing can reduce their chances of
   serious injury in the unlikely event of an emergency .
     * Wear clothes made of natural fabrics such as cotton, wool, denim or
       leather. Synthetics may melt when heated.
     * Dress to cover as much skin as possible.
     * Wear clothing that is roomy, avoiding restrictive clothing.
     * Wear low-heeled, leather or canvas shoes.

   What Not To Pack or Carry On Board Common Household Hazardous Materials
     * Watch for common household items that can be hazardous materials
       when transported by air. The changes in temperature and pressure
       during flight can cause items to leak, generate toxic fumes or
       start a fire.
     * Fireworks, signal flares, sparklers or other explosives.
     * Pressure Containers such as spray cans,scuba tanks, propane tanks,
       CO2 cartridges, and self-inflating rafts.
     * Weapons such as firearms, ammunition, gunpowder, mace, tear gas or
       pepper spray. Firearms may be checked and declared, if unloaded.
     * Knives and cutting instruments of all kinds are prohibited. Contact
       the airline to determine any additional airline restrictions ,
       www.faa.gov/airlineinfo.htm, that may apply.
     * Other hazardous materials - dry ice, gasoline-powered tools,
       wet-cell batteries, camping equipment with fuel, radioactive
       materials (except limited quantities), poisons, and infectioius
       substances.
     * Dry ice (4 pounds or less) for packing perishables, may be carried
       on board an aircraft provided the package is vented.
     * You must declare hazardous materials to airlines, express package
       carriers or the Postal Service. Violations carry a civil penalty of
       up to $27,500 for each occurrence and, in appropriate cases, a
       criminal penalty of up to $500,000 and/or up to five years
       imprisonment.

   Carry-On Baggage

   Think Small, Think Smart, Think Safe
     * Check with airline on the maximum size and number of carry-on bags
       allowed. Or, check out the carry-on bag web site,PDF,
       www.faa.gov/apa/carryon.htm
     * Keep essentials such as prescriptions, personal hygiene items,
       passports, important documents and valuables (jewelry or cameras)
       in your carry-on bag.
     * Plan to check more of your baggage and carry on less.
     * Be safety conscious when stowing baggage.
     * Stow heavy items under the seat in front of you, not overhead.
     * Dont stack items in the overhead bin.
     * Dont be a bin hog.
     * Dont overstuff the overhead bin.
     * IN AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION LEAVE YOUR BELONGINGS BEHIND.

   Airport Security Issues
     * For special travel advisories concerning security threats at your
       destination, call the Department of Transportations Travel Advisory
       Line at 1-800-221-0673.
     * Arrive early. Current security measures increase time needed to
       check in. When traveling with young children, infants, elderly or
       disabled passengers, build in even more time.
     * DO NOT leave your car unattended in front of the terminal. Security
       measures mean local parking rules are being strictly enforced and
       your car may be towed.
     * Keep your photo identification handy. If you do not have a photo
       ID, make sure you have two pieces of identification, one of which
       must be issued by a government authority. Minors are not required
       to have identification. Failure to have proper identification may
       result in additional security scrutiny. Some airlines may prohibit
       you from boarding without proper ID.
     * For international flights, airlines are required to collect your
       full name and ask you for a contact name and phone number.
     * Keep your eyes open for unattended packages and bags, and report
       them to authorities. Watch your bags and dont accept packages from
       strangers.
     * Be prepared to answer questions about who packed your bags and
       whether you might have left them unattended at any time. Think
       carefully and answer honestly--history has shown that criminals and
       terrorists use unwitting passengers to carry bombs or other
       dangerous items on board aircraft, either by tricking passengers
       into carrying packages or by simply slipping items into unwatched
       bags. If you have any doubts, say so.
     * Do not joke about having a bomb or firearm in your possession.
       Security personnel are trained to react when they hear these words.
       Penalties can be severe, and can include the possibility of time in
       prison and/or fines.
     * Both carry-on and checked bags are subject to being hand-searched,
       especially when airline security personnel cannot determine by
       X-ray the contents of a package.
     * Leave gifts unwrapped until after you arrive at your destination.
       Airline security personnel will open it if X-rays are unable to
       identify the contents.
     * Leave your firearms at home, and do not pack fireworks, flammable
       materials, household cleaners, or pressurized containers. Remember
       that violators of hazardous materials regulations are subject to
       civil penalties of up to $27,500 per violation, as well as possible
       criminal prosecution.

   Passenger Safety Information
     * Review the passenger safety card before takeoff and landing.
     * Listen carefully to the safety briefing.
     * Be able to locate emergency exits both in front and behind you.
       Count the rows between you and the nearest front and rear exits.
     * Locate the flotation device.
     * Make a mental plan of action in case of emergency.

   Turbulence

   Turbulence happens and much of it is unpredicted. And when it does
   happen, adults and children who are not buckled up can be seriously
   injured. Indeed, the majority of turbulence-related injuries and deaths
   occur when the seat belt sign is on.
     * Wear your seat belt at all times, turbulence is not always
       predictable.
     * Make sure your seat belt is secured snugly and low across the hips.
     * In non-fatal accidents, in-flight turbulence is the leading cause
       of injuries to airline passengers and flight attendants.
     * Each year, approximately 58 airline passengers in the United States
       are injured by turbulence while not wearing their seat belts.
     * From 1981 through December 1997, there were 342 reports of
       turbulence affecting major air carriers. As a result, three
       passengers died, 80 suffered serious injuries and 769 received
       minor injuries.
     * At least two of the three fatalities involved passengers who were
       not wearing their seat belts while the seat belt sign was
       illuminated.
     * Of the 80 passengers who were seriously injured, approximately 73
       were not wearing their seat belts while the seat belt sign was
       illuminated.
     * Generally, two-thirds of turbulence-related accidents occur at or
       above 30,000 feet. In 1997, about half of the accidents occurred
       above 30,000 feet.

   Child Safety Seats
     * FAA strongly recommends the use child safety seats for children
       under 40 lbs. It is important to check with the airline to see if
       the child seat will fit the width of the airline seat. While
       airline seats vary in width, a safety seat no wider than 16" in
       width should fit most coach seats.
     * Ask about discount fares for children under two travelling in a
       safety seat. Purchasing a discounted seat for your child is the
       only way to guarantee you will be able use a safety seat.
     * Ask about the airlines busiest travel times. Avoiding these times
       make it more likely you will have an empty seat next to you. In
       many cases, airlines will allow you to place your child
       infant/toddler in an empty seat next to you.
     * Children under 20 lbs should be in a rear-facing seat.
     * From 20-40 lbs use a forward-facing seat.
     * Place the infant seat in the window seat.
     * Ask airlines to arrange for assistance in making connections when
       traveling with children and a child safety seat.
     * Infant seats should not be placed in an aisle seat.

   For more information about child safety seats :
   www.faa.gov/apa/TURB/CRSTips/FRCRS.htm

   Exit Row Seating
     * You must be physically capable and willing to perform emergency
       actions when seated in emergency or exit rows. If you are not, ask
       for another seat.
     * Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the emergency evacuation
       techniques outlined on the written safety instructions. Ask
       questions if instructions are unclear.

   Cellulars, Laptops and Computer Games
     * The FCC and FAA ban cell phones for airborne use because its
       signals could interfere with critical aircraft instruments. Radios
       and televisions are also prohibited.
     * Laptops and other personal electronic devices (PEDs) such as
       hand-held computer games and tape or CD players are also restricted
       to use above 10,000 feet owing to concerns they could interfere
       with aircraft instrumentation.

   Unruly Passengers
     * Interference with the duties of any crewmember is a violation of
       federal law.
     * Fines could range up to $25,000 per violation in addition to
       criminal penalties.
     * The FBI, federal enforcement agencies, airlines, crewmembers and
       FAA have combined to vigorously pursue prosecution, which has
       resulted in imprisonment.

   Fire or Smoke
     * Use wet napkin or handkerchief over nose and mouth
     * Move away from fire and smoke.
     * Stay low.

   Evacuation
     * LEAVE YOUR POSSESSIONS BEHIND.
     * Stay low.
     * Proceed to the nearest front or rear exit count the rows between
       your seat and the exits.
     * Follow floor lighting to exit.
     * Jump feet first onto evacuation slide. Dont sit down to slide.
       Place arms across your chest, elbows in, and legs and feet
       together. Remove high-heeled shoes.
     * Exit the aircraft and clear the area.
     * Remain alert for emergency vehicles.
     * NEVER RETURN TO A BURNING AIRCRAFT.

   International Travel Resources

   International Aviation Safety Assessment Program (IASA)
   The FAA, as part of its responsibility to inform the public about
   safety issues, assesses the civil aviation authority of each country
   with service to the United States. These assessments determine whether
   or not the civil aviation authority (CAA) overseeing airline operations
   to and from the United States meets the safety standards set by a

   United Nations body known as the International Civil Aviation
   Organization (ICAO). CAAs are FAAs counterparts abroad. This assessment
   program began in 1992.

   The FAA has established two ratings for the status of these civil
   aviation authorities at the time of the assessment: (1) does comply
   with ICAO standards, (2) does not comply with ICAO standards.
     * Category 1, Does Comply with ICAO Standards: A civil aviation
       authority has been assessed by FAA inspectors and has been found to
       license and oversee air carriers in accordance with ICAO aviation
       safety standards.

     * Category 2. Does Not Comply with ICAO Standards: The FAA assessed
       this countrys civil aviation authority (CAA) and determined that it
       does not provide safety oversight of its air carrier operators in
       accordance with the minimum safety oversight standards established
       by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

   In general, carriers from countries in Category 2 status with existing
   flights to the United States at the time of the assessment will be
   allowed to continue operations at current levels under heightened FAA
   surveillance. Expansion or changes in services to the United States by
   such carriers are not permitted.

   Countries that do not have existing operations to the United States at
   the time of the assessment will not be permitted to commence service to
   the United States while in Category 2 status.

   Safety Record of Airlines/Aircraft

   A report prepared for the FAA by GRA, Inc. entitled A Report on Issues
   Related to Public Interest in Aviation Safety Data, found that:

   "... there currently is no evidence in accident data that would support
   the ranking of individual airlines based on their safety records.While
   there may be apparent differences in carrier safety records at any
   particular time, due largely to the infrequent but catastrophic nature
   of an air accident, there is no evidence that such distinctions persist
   nor that they are predictive of future safety performance. Rankings of
   airlines based on past accident records therefore provide no
   information to consumers seeking to make safety-enhancing comparisons
   for current or future travel choices."
