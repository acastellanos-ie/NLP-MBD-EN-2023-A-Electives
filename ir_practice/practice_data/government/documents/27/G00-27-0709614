Employment at JPL

   Jan 1997 - present: Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Chief Mission
   Planner

   Serving as chief mission planner for SRTM, a 50 million dollar NASA
       mission to map the Earth with synthetic aperture RADAR
       interferometry (launch in 1999). Responsible for all mission
       planning, including development of flight software, operations,
       mission activity timelines and orbit design.

   Feb 1996 - Jan 1997: Cassini Chief Mission Engineer

   Served as chief mission engineer for Cassini, a 1.8 billion dollar NASA
       mission to study Saturn and its environment (launched successfully
       in October 1997). Supervised team of 4-7 and was responsible for
       all mission engineering, including systems-level engineering of
       orbital and spacecraft design, navigation, telecommunications,
       spacecraft dynamics and risk management. Also responsible for
       development and maintenance of Mission Plan and mission-level
       requirements.

   Aug 1991 - Feb 1996: Cassini Mission Engineer

   Served as mission engineer for Cassini project. Heavy reliance on
       engineering, technical and political skills. Used multiple software
       packages in concert to explore complex trade spaces and identify
       creative solutions.

   May 1995 - Jan 1998: Cassini World Wide Web Development Team

   Authored JPL's Cassini home page, Mission section in particular. Used
       multiple software packages in concert to introduce general public
       to the Cassini mission via non-technical, visually stimulating
       world wide web home page.

   JPL World Wide Web Development Team (May 1995 - present)

   Assisting in continuing design of top levels of JPL's home page(s).
       Employing techniques in the forefront of web technology to
       introduce general public to JPL via non-technical, visually
       stimulating world wide web home page. Available to all at
       http://www.jpl.nasa.gov.

   Jan 1993 - present: Computer Graphics and Animation

   Developed the Solar System Simulator, an animation tool available via
       the web used to render views from any body in the solar system to
       any other. Assembled databases of planetary texture maps and
       spacecraft models.
       Developed computer animation & artwork for Cassini, Galileo, Mars
       Global Surveyor, Mars Pathfinder, Stardust, Pluto Express, Solar
       Probe and other NASA projects. Won logo design contests for Mars
       Global Surveyor, Mars Pathfinder and Mars Surveyor '98 projects.
       Animations have appeared in Telly and Intercom award winning videos
       and aired at NASA Headquarters, USA networks and on prime time
       national news affiliates. Artwork has appeared on NASA project
       logos, pins, patches, T-shirts and on PBS, Microsoft & Virtual
       Reality inc. CD-ROMs, U.S. Geological Survey videos and in USA
       Today, Science (Cover), Science News (Cover), Time, Aviation Week &
       Space Technology, Sky & Telescope, Space News, Aerospace America,
       Wired, Engineering & Science (Caltech), The Planetary Society,
       Odyssey, World Space Foundation News, college curricula and other
       periodicals, newspapers, and T-shirts.

   Aug 1991 - Feb 1992: CRAF Mission Engineer

   Served as mission engineer for CRAF project (Comet Rendezvous Asteroid
       Flyby). Major tasks included: development of software which
       illustrated comet viewing geometry via a convenient graphical user
       interface, and computing cometary dust and gas distributions to
       manage risk while satisfying science requirements.

Other professional and work experience

   1989 - 1991: research engineer, C. S. Draper Laboratories Advanced
   Concepts Section, Cambridge, MA

   Directed a Corporate Sponsored Research project on advanced suppression
       of engine compressor instabilities (Master's thesis). Evaluated
       difficulties in controlling engine stall to design a fault-tolerant
       flight-integrated system architecture. Research jointly with the
       MIT Gas Turbine Lab.

Education

   1986-1991: B.S and M.S, Aeronautics & Astronautics (Avionics).
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA

   Concentrated in space system engineering, radio communication, remote
       sensing, and multivariable control. Entered graduate program after
       three years as Draper Laboratory Graduate Fellow.

Publications

   Wolf, A, and D. Seal, "Exposure of the Cassini Spacecraft to Horseshoe
   and Tadpole Particle Zones," AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist
   Conference, AAS 95-382, Halifax, Nova Scotia, August 1995.

Biography

   David Seal grew up in Beverly, MA, a friendly suburb of Boston on
   Massachusetts' North Shore. He is the son of a foreign service officer
   - now a director of international theater development - and a middle
   school teacher and guidance counselor. David has a 13-year-old brother
   attending middle school in Missouri and a 21-year-old sister studying
   genetics at the University of Missouri.

   David attended MIT in Cambridge from 1986-1991, earning Bachelor and
   Masters degrees in Aerospace Engineering, and interning at the C. S.
   Draper Laboratories where he worked on fault tolerant computing and
   detecting stall conditions in jet engine compressors. Since 1991, he
   has been living in the Los Angeles area working for the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory on the Cassini Mission to Saturn and the Shuttle Radar
   Topography Mission. At JPL, David is a member of the Mission Design
   section, and focuses much of his time in orbital design, systems
   engineering, computer programming and web publishing. In his spare
   time, David does computer graphics and space artwork; his work has
   appeared in numerous magazines, including Sky & Telescope, Astronomy,
   Science, Science News, Space News, Time and Newsweek. His JPL
   space-related web sites receive over 50,000 hits per day. David has
   also designed the official project insignias for the Mars Pathfinder,
   Mars Global Surveyor, and Mars Surveyor 98 projects.
