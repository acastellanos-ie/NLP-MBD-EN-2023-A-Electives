     SAMHSA presents the three agency websites that maintain official data
   files on the numbers of people using or needing to use the Nation's
   network of substance abuse prevention, addiction treatment and mental
   health services.  SAMHSA's data-gathering operations help to determine
   the numbers of people at risk for mental and addictive disorders; their
   access to preventive services; treatment and other intervention
   services available in communities to people experiencing mental
   illnesses and substance abuse disorders; dollars available per capita;
   and many other variables.  SAMHSA also assesses what treatments works
   for whom; examines what makes quality care; and determines whether
   needs and services are a good fit.
