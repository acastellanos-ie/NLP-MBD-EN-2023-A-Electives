   The FCC has designated the educational materials listed in its Table of
    Small Entity Compliance Guides to be "small entity compliance guides"
   under Section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness
      Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996)
                                  (SBREFA).

       We believe that these guides can be especially helpful to small
                                  entities.
