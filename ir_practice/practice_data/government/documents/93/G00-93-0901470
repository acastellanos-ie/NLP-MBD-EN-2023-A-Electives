   CLEAN Brownfields Loan Program

   In 2000, Governor Gray Davis signed into law the "Cleanup Loans and
   Environmental Assistance to Neighborhoods (CLEAN) Program" (Senate Bill
   667, Sher) establishing new financial incentives to encourage property
   owners, developers, community groups and local governments to redevelop
   abandoned and underutilized urban properties in California.

   At the present time, funding for the Loan Program is extremely limited.
   For current information on the availability of funds, please contact
   the Department at (916) 324-0706 or loans@dtsc.ca.gov.
