About the New Look

   Why the change?

   Things looking a little different at the AFM web site. We thought so.
   Hopefully, once you get use to the differences, you will be able to
   find things easier and faster with this new layout. See How to Navigate
   the New AFM Site.

   There are a number of reasons why we updated the site, which you may
   read for yourself further along. But basically it ensures that we can
   provide you with continued and improved service.

   Reasons for AFM's new look
    1. Section 508 compliance/compatibility.
       In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require Federal
       agencies to make their electronic and information technology
       accessible to people with disabilities. Inaccessible technology
       interferes with an individual's ability to obtain and use
       information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted to
       eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new
       opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage
       development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The
       law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure,
       maintain, or use electronic and information technology. To read
       more about Section 508 and the government's position, go to
       http://www.section508.gov.
    2. More professional look.
       We decided to revamp the site in the process to present a more
       professional image to the public that is more fitting of an
       official government site.
    3. Consistent/Logical Presentation of Information.
       We are reorganizing the content of our site to make it easier to
       find. All of the same useful information that AFM has provided in
       the past should be more readily available when the redesign is
       complete. Plus, you may notice several new areas of interest as you
       visit.

   Take a look and our updated look and feel of the website. Many thanks
   and big kudos to our excellent team for all that you see.

   What has changed / is changing?
     * New navigation areas.
     * Top navigation
     * Side navigation.
     * What's new. The what's new area is located at the right-hand side
       of your screen. It will hold relevant information about the area
       that you find it in and will be updated as necessary.

Using this web site

   Browser Version

   This Web site is designed to work on the widest possible range of
   operating systems and browsers. The AFM web site and the applications
   used within work most effectively using a relatively modern Java- and
   JavaScript-enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or
   higher, or Netscape Communicator 4.1 or higher. If you are using an
   older browser, you may choose to upgrade to a more recent version:

     Get Netscape Navigator Now
     (http://home.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html)
     Get Internet Explorer Now (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/)

   Screen Resolution

   The AFM web site will work on all screen resolution settings. The
   "Web-safe" colour palette of 216 colours has been used. You can
   set/check what your resolution is by opening
   StartMenu/Settings/ControlPanel/Display. Choose the settings tab.

   Images

   Images on our web site which are in the public domain may be used
   without permission. Please note that some images on our site have been
   obtained from other organizations. Permission to use these images
   should be obtained directly from those organizations.

   Links

   Links may be made to our web site from other personal and
   organizational web pages. We request that you link to our site rather
   than downloading portions of it to another web server, so that our
   viewers will see our most current information.

   Access for Disabled Persons

   If you are a person with a disability and have trouble using our web
   site, services, products, or facilities, please tell us about the
   problem. You also may write to us at

   Technical Web Site Problems

   If you encounter technical difficulties while using our Web site, such
   as a bad link or a file that won't download properly, please tell us
   the URL of the page that needs to be fixed. Also, if you have general
   comments about the design or presentation of the AFM web site, please
   let us know. Send your message to our Web Team.

   How can I learn about getting around in my browser?

   Since there is not a "standard" browser (many of us use Internet
   Explorer, Netscape Navigator, or Netscape Communicator just to name a
   few), it would be difficult to address all the different browsers here.
   Therefore, we suggest that the best way to learn to navigate with your
   browser is to go to the Help option at the top of your screen. Another
   thing that is very important is to brush up on your Windows skills. We
   cannot stress the importance of this enough!

   Why doesn't my screen look the same as Joe's down the hall?

   Well, there are several reasons things don't look the same.

   First, you may have a different browser. Not only do Netscape and
   Internet Explorer display things differently, but different versions of
   Netscape display things differently than the previous version. The same
   holds true for Internet Explorer.

   Second, you may not have the same size of monitor. This can make a real
   difference as to what is displayed.

   Third, your monitor resolution may be set differently than the person
   next to you. I have found that using 800X600 resolution works pretty
   good at getting most things to display. If you need assistance with
   this, please contact your local or Area computer staff.

   Why won't my e-mail work?

   In order to send mail electronically, you must have set up your browser
   preferences for e-mail. In Netscape, click on Options, Mail & News
   Preferences, Server, to insert your e-mail information. In Internet
   Explorer, click on Tools, Internet Options, the Programs Tab, and set
   up your identity and e-mail.

   Printing

   Printing web pages is generally as simple as pushing the print button
   on your browser, but you can have problems with the following:

   PDF Issues

     Printing a .pdf document
     Open a required document in the Reader by clicking on the link.
     Select File-Print from the menu bar in the Adobe Acrobat Reader.
     Low-end printers cannot handle large Adobe Acrobat documents. Send
     the document to the printer in sections to avoid printer memory
     overload.

     Saving a .pdf document
     On your computer, make a directory into which the document will be
     saved (e.g. c:\download).
     On the website, locate the document you wish to download.
     Right click on the link to the required document and select Save
     Target As (Internet Explorer) / Save Link As (Netscape) from the
     drop-down menu.
     When prompted, specify a drive and directory into which the document
     should be saved (e.g. c:\download).
     Click on Save / OK to save the document.

Document Formats and Technologies Used on this site

   This site attempts to provide content which is compatible with as many
   browsers and computer types as possible. As well as the regular HTML
   pages and graphics, you will find that the AFM web site sometimes
   contain the following types of content: Javascript, Cascading style
   sheets, and DHTML.

   Usage of proprietary features of NN or IE, Java applets, VBScript, and
   other advanced features have been limited as much as possible due to
   accessibility issues of our users. Any files that may require plug-in
   usage will be accompanied by a link to that plug-in for convenience.

     About Javascript

     This Web site uses some JavaScript, particularly when its use
     enables us to improve the user interface. This application gives the
     web browser some extra capabilities. Common uses for JavaScript are
     "mouseovers", which are used to make images change when your mouse
     moves over them, and pop-up windows, which are used to make a
     smaller window appear on your screen in front of your main browsing
     window.

     Compatibility Issues: some browsers, and some older versions of
     browsers, can't use JavaScript, or may not understand newer versions
     of JavaScript. If you experience JavaScript-related error messages,
     there are a couple of things you can do to correct the problem. One
     approach is to upgrade to a more
     recent version of your browser. The JavaScript we use is compatible
     with Netscape Navigator 4.0 and greater and with Microsoft Internet
     Explorer 4.0 and greater. Please refer to the Browsers section of
     this page for links to the latest versions. If you do not wish to
     upgrade your browser, try turning off
     JavaScript (find the relevant entry under your browser's
     'Preferences' or 'Options'). Although you will lose some of the
     extra features of our interface, you will not lose the ability to
     effectively use this Web site.
       _______________________________________________________________

     About JAVA
     Java is used to create small programs called "applets" which run
     inside your browser. The AFM web site currently does not use Java.

     Compatibility Issues: Not all browsers can use Java, and some
     Macintosh computers require Java to be installed on the computer and
     not in the browser.

       _______________________________________________________________

     About Portable Document Format (PDF) Files

     To ensure you will be able to see a PDF file in its entirety, please
     obtain the most recent edition of the free Acrobat Reader from the
     Adobe® Web site.

     HTML, the code used to create web pages, can not maintain all of the
     formatting and presentation for many documents. In such cases,
     another process is used to display the document called Portable
     Document Format (PDF). The PDF process maintains the look and
     presentation of the original document using a free reader available
     from Adobe (http://www.adobe.com). These PDF files can be viewed
     across multiple platforms (MAC, PC, UNIX) using the appropriate
     reader for that platform. Please be sure to use the most current
     reader from Adobe to ensure compatibility for all PDF files on AFMs
     site.

     To use a PDF document, a reader program must be installed on your
     computer to display, print, and navigate. To VIEW or PRINT the
     document via the Internet, click on the link as any other file. To
     SAVE the document to your computer, place your mouse cursor over the
     link, click the right mouse
     button and choose the Save As option.

     Adobe provides online conversion tools for Adobe PDF documents that
     help visually disabled users whose screen reader software is not
     compatible with the Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0. These online tools
     convert PDF documents into either HTML or ASCII text, which can then
     be read by a number of common screen reader programs.

     Compatibility Issues: The Adobe Acrobat® Reader is required to read
     PDF documents. If you don't have it, the Adobe* Acrobat* reader
     (http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html) is available
     for downloading at no cost from Adobe's Web site at
     http://www.adobe.com .
