                                 About DataSlate

     The DataSlate architecture provides tools and specifications for a
   system to display large data sets represented as raster images.
   DataSlate is a Java-based browser which allows the user to navigate,
   display, compare and analyze data sets. These data sets are stored in a
   predefined format called DataStruct or SimpleStruct, which provide
   generalized binning schemes to partition large data sets into frames
   and framelets that can easily be accessed via network server or on a
   CD-ROM. A utility called SimpleGen (which requires the IDL processing
   system from Research Systems, Inc.) is used to convert raster data sets
   into SimpleStruct format.

   The DataSlate browser is intended to allow the user to navigate very
   large scientific data sets by traversing a hierarchical file system
   where data sets covering the same area are stored together. Data from
   different sensors or data taken at different times can easily be viewed
   and compared. A major design goal is to simplify the computational
   requirements on the browser by forcing the data organization to be
   optimized in advance.

   Two data storage hierarchies are used by DataSlate, called DataStruct
   and SimpleStruct. DataStruct will provide a geo-referenced structure
   where all data is mapped to standard values of resolution in pixels per
   degree. The starting layer of the DataStruct is layer A and represents
   a data resolution of 8 degrees per pixel. Thus the entire Earth can be
   represented with just 45 pixels (in width) at layer A. The SimpleStruct
   storage hierarchy is much like DataStruct, except that the data sets
   are not required to be in any specific projection or mapped to a
   geographic grid. The data sets are mapped into a hierarchical directory
   structure based on the physical size of the primary data set. Only
   co-registered data sets (images covering exactly the same scene) can be
   stored in the same SimpleStruct.

   Both DataStruct and SimpleStruct organize data sets into frames of
   4,096 x 4,096 pixels. Each frame is stored in a single directory. The
   frames are tiled into framelets of some size, generally an array of 16
   rows and 16 columns with a size of 256 x 256 pixels per framelet. These
   dimensions have been developed to simplify access to related data,
   provide reasonable file sizes for both network and local CD_ROM access,
   and provide reasonable storage hierarchies.

   DataSlate has a simple set of controls for selecting and viewing data
   sets. When DataSlate is invoked it searches for a default data
   inventory label, which identifies data collections that are available
   for viewing and presents icons on the display screen for each data
   collection.

   The selected data set is displayed on the DataSlate screen at its
   lowest resolution. The user presses the plus button to increase the
   resolution by a factor of two. The user can move around the data set by
   holding down the mouse and dragging the image around the screen. The
   user can browse through the different data sets within a collection by
   pressing the left or right buttons on either side of the Channel 1 data
   set name display.

   DataSlate has the ability to display another window on the screen
   called Channel 2. The user can open the channel two window by pressing
   the button to the left of the Channel 2 data set name window. When
   Channel 2 is opened it will display another data set in the window
   which can be compared with the data set in Channel 1. Dragging the
   cursor in either window will move the images in both channels
   simultaneously. The Channel 2 window can be resized by clicking and
   dragging on its outline.

   Clicking on the data set name in the Channel selection window will
   bring up a text file describing the data set. Clicking on "Back to Data
   set" will return to the image display.

   The X and Y coordinates of the current cursor location (measured from
   the upper left of the image) are displayed on the right side of the
   panel. The current resolution level is displayed below the zoom
   buttons. The Load button will return from a data set display to the
   collection menu screen. Hitting the Load button from the collection
   menu screen will allow the user to select another DataSlate collection
   label for loading. The Save button will save the contents of the
   current screen to a gif image. Clicking on the right mouse button (or
   control-clicking on Macintosh) will bring up a shortcut menu of
   DataSlate function and allows immediate selection of alternate data
   sets.

   Clicking on the right mouse button (or control-clicking on Macintosh)
   in either channel will bring up a shortcut menu of DataSlate functions
   and allows immediate selection of alternate data sets for that channel.
