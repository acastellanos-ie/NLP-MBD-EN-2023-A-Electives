                        Operations and Checkout Building

   Horizontally integrated payloads are received, assembled and integrated
   in the Operations and Checkout Building before they are mated with the
   orbiter at the Orbiter Processing Facility. The Spacelab and its
   payloads constitute a large majority of the horizontal payloads.

   The Operations and Checkout Building is a five-story structure
   containing 600,000 square feet of offices, laboratories, astronaut crew
   quarters and spacecraft assembly areas. The rear of the building
   contains a class 100,000 clean room that runs the entire length and
   height of the building. Two 27.5 ton Cranes are used to move payloads
   in this facility. The O&C Building is located in the industrial area
   immediately east of the KSC headquarters building.
