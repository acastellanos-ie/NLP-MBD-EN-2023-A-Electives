     Overview

     The Health Services Research and Development Service (HSR&D) pursues
     research at the interface of health care systems, patients and
     health care outcomes. HSR&D underscores all aspects of VA health
     care; specifically quality, access, patient outcomes and health care
     costs.

     Mission

     The HSR&D mission is to advance knowledge and promote innovations
     that improve the health and care of veterans and the nation. Many of
     the studies conducted by this Service have been used within and
     outside VA to assess new technologies, explore strategies for
     improving health outcomes, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
     services and therapies.

     The need for high quality health services research continues to grow
     to keep pace with and respond to the rapid changes underway within
     the Veterans Health Administration and in the health care community
     as a whole. HSR&D carries out this mission through peer reviewed
     research and through its key centers:
     * thirteen Centers of Excellence
     * Health Economics Resource Center (HERC)
     * Management Decision and Research Center (MDRC)
     * VA Information Resource Center (VIREC)
