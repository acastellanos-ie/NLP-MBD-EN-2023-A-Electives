      Welcome to the Childstats' Related Sites page. This page contains links
      to data sets, tables, databases, and reports provided by related
      websites on different aspects of child well-being. These links are
      organized into the following major categories:
        * Child Well-Being and Youth Indicators
        * Population and Family Characteristics
        * Economic Security
        * Health
        * Behavior and Social Environment
        * Education
        * Kids' Pages
        * Research on Child Well-Being

      Within the major categories, links are grouped by subtopic, (e.g.,
      below Health, one will find links to birth, children's health status,
      health care, etc.) and level of estimate (e.g., national and state
      data). Links are chosen based on their relevance to data presented in
      the Forum's annual America's Children report, objectivity, and data
      quality. Finally, Children's or Kid's Pages of Forum agencies are also
      listed.

      Links are generally provided to sources of national surveys and
      assessments, vital statistics, census data, and reports or research
      based upon these sources. In general, links are not provided to
      administrative data sources at national, state, or local levels, since
      these data are generally not comparable across jurisdictions.
