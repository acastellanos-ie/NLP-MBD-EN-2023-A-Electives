          FSL Modeling and Visualization: A Collection of Case Studies

   Forecast Research Division
     __________________________________________________________________

  Overview

   On this page is a collection of fairly detailed case studies presented
   to document how the local model, the SFM in this case, performs in the
   area of northeastern Colorado for a variety of weather phenomenon.

  Index of cases

   I. Winter snow events.
   A. Mountain and/or orographically forced events.

   [snowflake_blue.gif] 10-11 February 2000: Mountain snows (also plains
       and DCVZ event).
       Description: Main upper level low morning of 10th still over Calif
       due w of us but minor sht wv ahead of this feature moving across CO
       with relatively unstable lapse rates in zonal flow producing areas
       and some banding of snow in mtns. So not a straightforward or
       simple orographic only case.
       Quick look at the verification/comparison: SFM 15z/10 Feb run had
       more snow in zone 34 than in zone 33 (where there was very little
       predicted), whereas snow model had slightly more in 33 vs. 34. More
       did tend to fall in 33, and even MORE fell just to the east with
       Virginia Dale the big winner with 13.5" (this band extended e
       across the plains, with zones 49/50 getting 6-8" of snow (some of
       this coming after 12z however). SFM did pick up on an e-w band onto
       the plains near the CO/WY border, tho also had one e from COS and
       this srn one did NOT occur. A separate snow max does exist near
       Virginia Dale in the SFM; R/T model (Rhea/Thaler orographic snow
       model) had nothing to up to an inch for Virginia Dale/Zone 35.
       So, mixed results, would say that it appears the 15z SFM did not do
       quite as well with the mountain snows, since it erroneously favored
       the more srn over the more nrn mtns.

   [snowflake_blue.gif] 14 February 2000: Mountain snows.
       Description: Mountain snowfall for Feb 14th (0800) to Feb 15th
       0800. Part of a continuing event. Concentrating here on the
       evening/overnight snow potential mainly. Turned out to be a
       surprisingly heavy event that began really after midnight (though
       snow did fall much of the day in some mtn areas...tough to say how
       much...Loveland ski area video looked to be at least S-, maybe
       toward S at times during the day, but think some of the day stuff
       diminished before dark, then second batch developed) with passage
       of a sht wave trof (this was actually the remnants of a significant
       wave that had been off the coast on Sunday). Some lightning near
       SLC the near WY/CO border overnight. At ski report time many areas
       were snowing hard, particularly more nrn mtns. This was a pretty
       sig miss for the forecasters as well as the eta 10km model (note
       how the 00z run had very little predicted for the mountains). NO
       SFM for this case, just eta at 10 km.

  [snowflake_blue.gif] 17 February 2000: Potential mountain snows.

    Description: Overprediction of snow for the overnight period as an upper
    level trof advancing on the area. We had consistently predicted snow to
    begin too early with this one, but question is what did the snow model
    produce? Eta had snow begining and accumulating overnight but notice 21z sfm
    did not. NOTE: SFM not available for 21z run after 10z (13h fcst). Also, 21z
    run was the first SFM run in a couple of days. Note that SFM did not predict
    much of anything, which was correct for this case. Snow did fall in far wrn
    CO mtns.

  [snowflake_blue.gif] 7 March 2000: Potential mountain snows.

    Description: Snow and blowing snow advisory was issued. Appears the greatest
    amount of snow fell farther north, or extreme swrn CO. Coop site with the
    greatest snow was at Gould, near the location of where the SFM had a rather
    extreme local max. Note that station Gould CSFC2: GOULD 4SE 9200 0809: 40 /
    4 / 1.03 / 8.2 / 40 reported about 1" of melted, and they are located near
    the SFM precipitation max. (Gould is on the west side of Cameron Pass).
    Granted the SFM 09z/7 Mar run did have a whopping 3.8" of melted in this
    area but it is interesting that this DOES appear to be a favored area for
    this storm.

  [snowflake_blue.gif] 10 March 2000: Potential very heavy foothill snows.

    Description: This potential snow followed the end of a period of mountain
    orographic snows with some SFM output saved, but no gif files. This case was
    saved because of the very focused heavy foothill snows forecasted for the
    foothills of western Boulder and northern Jefferson Counties up to and east
    of the Divide. Very persistent forecast of well over a foot of snow in this
    area, with snow forecast area spreading east to about I-25 (BOU forecast to
    get as much as 9" of snow). There was also an area of snow forecast on the
    west side of the mountains in NWly flow but to a much lesser extent.

    Why the focused snowfall? Surface pattern on the plains was a Longmont
    Anticyclone in the SFM forecast, so low-level winds were converging into the
    foothills from the east, whereas there was NWly flow from the west that
    would serve to enhance the convergence even further. Couple this with a
    fairly unstable atmosphere, and the ingredients were set (at least in the
    model) for a persistent area of convective snows. What happened? Need to get
    more info, but there was never any snow in Boulder, and basically none in
    the foothills either. The snowfall farther west in the NWly flow was
    probably a pretty good forecast.

  [snowflake_blue.gif] 12 March 2000: Significant but underforecast
  orographically forced mountain snows.

    Description: A pretty intense period of snow in NWly flow with the passage
    of an embedded shortwave trough, mostly falling overnight after 02z on 12
    March. This was a highly orographically forced event where the max is often
    squeezed out in the springtime. Snow amounts forecast for the event were way
    underdone, though snow was predicted.

    Unfortunately did not save the critical SFM runs, which would be the 15z or
    21z runs from 11 March. May try to rerun this case.

  [snowflake_blue.gif] 6 November 2000: Potential snow with a Longmont
  Anticyclone

    Very nice LGM Anticyclone case. Associated with it was a persistent area of
    light to perhaps moderate low-density snow mainly over the srn/wrn DEN
    suburbs in the aftn/evening of the 6th.

    Saved the 1800 UTC runs of the hot-start MM5 and the Mesoeta.

   [snowflake_red.gif] More stuff: Text saved data (forecasts, obs, etc.).

   [snowflake_blue.gif] Figure 1: MM5 1800 UTC run 0 h surface wind and
       reflectivity, overlaid with obs and NOWRAD. Notice how the MM5
       initial wind field nicely matches the observations showing the
       lighter winds with different directions near Boulder County, as
       would be expected since it initialized with LAPS.

   [snowflake_blue.gif] Figure 2: Mesoeta 1800 UTC run 0 h surface wind,
       overlaid with obs and NOWRAD. The match of the winds with the obs
       is not nearly as good as with MM5 at 0 h.

   [snowflake_blue.gif] Figure 3: 0 h surface winds from MM5 and the
       Mesoeta overlaid for direct comparison. These are displayed at
       maximum resolution, which for the AWIPS display is 20 km for the

  [snowflake_blue.gif] 15 November 2000: Potential plains snowfall associated
  with a Longmont Anticyclone as well as mountain orographic snowfall.

    Hot start MM5 runs saved from 1200 UTC and 1800 UTC on 15 November.

    Shortwave trough passage with synoptic NWly flow behind it, with potential
    for a LGM Anticyclone and of course mountain orographic snowfall. In this
    case the NWlys tended to overwhelm any significant LGM Anticyclone, which
    was overpredicted by the model runs. A nice snowband did occur on the plains
    but appeared to be at the leading edge of the trough and surge of NWly low
    level flow, and proceeded to move from near the foothills at 13-14 UTC to
    vicinity of AKO by ~1800 UTC. This band was not predicted very well by the
    1200 UTC MM5 run, while with the hot start the 1800 UTC run nicely captured
    it and held it together for awhile as it continued east (while diminishing
    in real life), about as forecast.

   In the mountains good snowfall occurred commencing probably ~1000 UTC
   on 15 Nov, with most of it probably over by the evening of the 15 Nov.
   Both runs tended to underforecast the amount of snowfall, but appeared
   to do a decent job with distribution, with Steamboat (12" for 24 h
   ending 16 Nov at 1200 UTC) and Vail (10" for similar) getting by far
   the most.

       while snowfall associated with the Longmont Anticyclone (zone 39,
       for example) was overforecast.

       total precipitation and snowfall, for 18 h period ending at 1200

       farther east on the plains, capturing the area of snow associated
       with the shortwave trough, but still having a band with the LGM
       Anticyclone that was not there. While it is not possible to know
       how much snow fell during the 1200-1800 UTC period on 15 Nov in the
       mountains, it looks like this run did not do as well as the 1200
       UTC run, with both underforecasting mountain snowfall for this
       event.

   [snowflake_blue.gif] Figure 21: Closeup with cities overlay of MM5 1800
       UTC run 18 h forecast of storm total precipitation and snowfall,
       for 18 h period ending at 1200 UTC on 16 Nov 00. Note there is a
       max of snowfall near Steamboat, where 12" in 24 h ending at 1200
       UTC/16 Nov fell. The forecast is only for a max of 1.5", but it may
       be fair to subtract ~6" from the 24 h snowfall total (based on the
       ~2 pm snow report on 15 Nov) at Steamboat to get a comparitive ob
       of ~6". So while still a substantial underforecast, at least the
       max in location had the right idea.



  [snowflake_blue.gif] 17 November 2000: Quick snow event with a northerly surge
  (Longmont Anticyclone) and shortwave trough in the northerly flow; also
  mountain orographic snowfall.

    Setup was a shortwave moving south in the upper level ~nly flow with an
    accompanying LGM Anticyclone type surge. A similar type of feature on
    Wednesday produced a burst of snow more on the eastern plains but pretty
    much a null event many areas along the Front Range. MM5 run did not predict
    much with this event except for an area of snow more over zone 35 into zone
    36, but very little out on the plains or even on the plains near the
    foothills. This despite a good job of predicting the strong turning (to
    upslope) winds with the LGM Anticyclone/post-surge flow. Mesoeta forecast
    also had precipitation predicted, but not nearly focused enough, or enough
    predicted. At 20 km resolution perhaps the strong e-w gradient away from the
    foothills would be too much to expect.

    What happened was a burst of snow began ~23z locally and quickly became at
    least moderate snow here, with a good burst of nely winds producing some
    blowing snow. By ~715 pm had accumulated ~3.5" here in the parking lot, but
    when I got home at ~730pm could only measure 1.5", so quite an extreme
    dropoff with distance east of the foothills. Heaviest accumulations were in
    fact in the foothills themselves of zone 36, with up to 8" near Tiny Town.
    Note how Allenspark had less than an inch. One thing about the snow was it
    had very low liquid water content; at least 20:1 or higher, so in effect
    some model predictions were not far off from that perspective.

   Saved the 18z run of both the hot-start MM5 and the Mesoeta. Most of
   the snow fell here in BOU from 23z/17th to 04z/18th.

   In terms of the mountains, both models predicted a rather light event,
   and generally only an inch or two fell, with Eldora getting 3" (upslope
   from the east there probably responsible for most of this).
