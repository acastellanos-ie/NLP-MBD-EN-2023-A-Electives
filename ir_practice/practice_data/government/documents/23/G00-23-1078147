   Burial & Memorial Benefits
   A Sacred Trust: The Story of the National Cemetery Administration
       This video program provides an overview of the National Cemetery
       Administration and the many services it provides to our Nation's
       veterans. Through a dramatic presentation of one family's
       experience, this program depicts the entire burial process,
       covering such topics as eligibility requirements, military funeral
       honors, headstones and markers, and the Presidential Memorial
       Certificate that is given to the next of kin. Numerous cemetery
       directors provide counterpoint to the story, describing the
       National Cemetery Administration's history, its efforts to expand
       burial capacity, its care and compassion for veterans' families,
       and its dedication to the perpetual care and maintenance of
       veterans' gravesites. For more information on burial eligibility or
       other VA benefits, call 1-800-827-1000.
