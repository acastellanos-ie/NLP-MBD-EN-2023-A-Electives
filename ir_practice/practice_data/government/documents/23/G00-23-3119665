                The Department of Preventive Medicine of the University of
                Iowa College of Medicine was contracted to prepare a
                document addressing the research needs for maintaining the
                safe mobility of older women in the United States, with an
                emphasis of automobile driving as well as other modes of
                transportation. This activity was funded by a grant from
                the National Safety Council.


        * Research Note: Estimating the Number of Vehicles Adapted for Use
                by Persons with Disabilities PDF version (11.6k)
                NHTSA is interested in estimating the size of the
                population of vehicles adapted specifically for
                transporting persons with disabilities, as it is not
                presently known how many vehicles have such adaptations.
                NHTSA is also interested in the safety of vehicles with
                adaptive equipment.

                      The introduction of new technology continues to
                      broaden opportunities for people with disabilities
                      to drive vehicles with adaptive devices. Taking
                      advantage of these opportunities, however, can be
                      time consuming and, sometimes, frustrating.
