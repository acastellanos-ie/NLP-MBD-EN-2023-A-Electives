   sell topographic maps. To locate a USGS map dealer near you, click
   here. USGS Earth Science Information Centers (ESICs) also sell
   topographic maps.  Follow this link to the ESIC home page or call
   1-888-ASK-USGS.
   Scanned versions of all the topographic maps are also available online.
   Follow this link for information on how to use the National Atlas to
   view a topographic map.

    3. Can I use nationalatlas.gov to get driving directions between two
   points in the United States?

   No, this is not a function of the National Atlas. The following web
   sites do provide this service and we welcome information on additional
   sites.
   MapQuest
   MapBlast
   MSN Expedia

    4. What is the scale of the atlas maps?

   Most of our data are collected at a scale of 1:2,000,000 and are
   intended for use at a national or large regional scales. In the map
   browser, a bar scale appears under the map.

    5. How do I get more detailed information?

   The National Atlas data layers come from many different Federal
   agencies, and these agencies are the most appropriate sources for more
   detailed information. Links from nationalatlas.gov to these agency web
   sites are provided in several ways. The Identify function returns
   information with links to additional sites. There are also links
   provided in many of the metadata (data documentation) files. Click a
   map layer name in the upper right-hand frame of the interactive mapper
   to display its documentation.
   You may also find detailed maps by searching the National Geospatial
   Data Clearinghouse. Follow this link to the Clearinghouse.
   You can also use nationalatlas.gov to view detailed aerial photographs
   and large-scale topographic maps. Follow this link for information on
   how to use the National Atlas to view aerial photos and topographic
   maps.
   The USGS Earth Science Information Center (ESIC) also has a diverse
   collection of natural science information available both in digital and
   printed formats and at a variety of scales. Follow this link to the
   ESIC or call them toll-free at 1-888-ASK-USGS.

    6. How do I find (a town, place, feature, etc.)?

   The National Atlas can be used to locate named places within the United
   States. Please follow this link for more information on the Query
   Function and other map browser capabilities.

    7. I need a page-size map of the United States that I can print from
   my computer. Is there one on your site?

   No, not yet. You can use nationalatlas.gov to make and print maps of
   your own design. But we do not yet offer a polished reference map of
   the United States. However, the following sites have links to simple
   outline maps in formats appropriate for printing. We welcome
   information on other sites that provide similar maps.

   Austin
   About.com Geography
   Houghton Mifflin Company Education Place
   National Geographic Xpeditions
   Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook

    8. I need a zip code map of the United States. Is one included in
   nationalatlas.gov?

   We do not have a zip code layer at this time. As far as we know, there
   are no free zip code maps available online. Several private companies
   sell zip code maps, either online or on CD-ROM. Follow this link to the
   U.S. Postal Service zip code information page.

    9. Does the National Atlas include a map showing the regions of the
   United States?

   We have not included a "Regions" map layer because the definition of
   regions is highly subjective. The definition of a particular region
   depends on the perspective of the user, the purpose of the map, or
   other factors. The following sites contain more information on the
   determination of regions.
   Helping Your Child Learn Geography, U.S. Department of Education
   An Outline of American Geography, by Birdsall & Florin

   10. How do I report a problem with the data or with nationalatlas.gov?

   Please send comments, bug reports, suggestions for improvements,
   questions, and any other communications to us at atlasmail@usgs.gov. We
   appreciate your input and try to respond promptly to all messages.

   11. I can't find the map I need or an answer to my question here. Who
   should I contact?

   We suggest trying the U.S. Geological Survey's Earth Science
   Information Center (ESIC). The ESIC offers nationwide information and
   sales service for USGS map products and natural science publications.
   ESIC can fill orders for custom products such as aerial photographs and
   orthophotoquads, digital cartographic data, and geographic names data.
   ESIC can also provide information about maps from other organizations.
   Follow this link to the ESIC home page or call 1-888-ASK-USGS.

   12. What products and services are included in the National Atlas?

   Current Products and Services

   Make maps - Online Interactive Maps
   Since April, 1998, you've been able to make and use your own National
   Atlas maps. All you need is a Web browser and a connection to the
   Internet.
   Multimedia Maps
   Multimedia technologies are used to supplement and enhance cartographic
   information products; to tell narrative stories; to deliver interactive
   maps; to develop maps that show change over time; and to facilitate the
   visual presentation and understanding of complex geographic phenomena
   and relationships.
   Printed Maps
   In the tradition of the original National Atlas of 1970, the new atlas
   includes high-quality paper maps depicting a variety of national
   conditions. A traditional, bound collection of maps is not planned at
   this time.
   Printable Maps
   In addition to interactive maps, the National Atlas of the United
   States includes page-size (8.5 by 11 inch) maps designed for printing
   and reproduction. These maps are offered in the following file formats:
     * Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) format. Maps in this format can be
       viewed in your browser window.
     * Portable Document Format (PDF). You will need Acrobat Reader
       software to view and print PDF files. Get Acrobat Reader.
     * Encapsulated PostScript format (EPS), a format used by publishing
       professionals. National Atlas EPS files were generated as Adobe
       Illustrator 8.0 files.

   Spatial Data Bases
   This is a fancy phrase that means "digital map layer." Federal partners
   produce a wide variety of information and statistics that have a
   spatial component. That is, the information they collect is keyed to
   some location (space) in the United States. There are many different
   types of keys to American locations. Latitude and longitude, state and
   county boundaries, zip code boundaries, addresses, and the boundaries
   of Congressional Districts are examples of spatial keys. Any data base
   with a spatial component can be turned into a map. These digital map
   layers are available now.
   Metadata
   Information about a spatial data base is commonly called "metadata."
   For each spatial data base (map layer) included in the National Atlas
   we have produced a separate metadata file. Each metadata file includes
   information describing the contents of a map layer. Metadata files also
   include information describing how a map layer was made, its lineage,
   and its quality.
   Scientific and Expository Articles:
   We've been asking prospective customers to tell us what they expect
   from a National Atlas. In addition to interactive maps and mapping
   information, these people have told us that they're interested in
   learning more about topics that directly affect or contribute to their
   quality of life. They want their curiosity stimulated and they want
   Atlas to raise the standard for the level of information presented and
   the way it is presented. These folks want a National Atlas that will
   enhance their knowledge of their place in society. And they want a
   deeper understanding of how the natural environment affects their
   choices and fresh insights into changes that humans have made to that
   environment. We will continue to supplement our cartographic products
   with well-written, authoritative, and provocative narratives.

   13. I've noticed the little registered trademark symbol in "The
   National Atlas of the United States of America^®." Does this mean that
   National Atlas data is proprietary?

   No. Nearly all information collected by the Federal Government is in
   the public domain and use of data produced under this project will not
   be restricted in any way. Both "National Atlas of the United States^®"
   and "The National Atlas of the United States of America^® " are
   registered trademarks of the United States Department of the Interior.
   The USGS has been publishing National Atlas products since 1970 and has
   simply taken action to trademark this term to incorporate all new
   graphic and electronic products of The National Atlas of the United
   States of America^®.

   14. What is the appropriate citation for National Atlas data layers?

   To cite the National Atlas, we suggest:

   National Atlas of the United States, December 8, 2000,
   http://nationalatlas.gov

   Use the date found on the bottom of the map layers warehouse page
   (http://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html).
   For individual layers, we suggest a slightly different format including
   the author and the layer title, and using the publication date for the
   individual data layer, i.e.

   U.S. Geological Survey, April 10, 2000, Congressional Districts of the
   United States - 106th Congress, in National Atlas of the United States,
   http://nationalatlas.gov.
   Chris Daly, Spatial Climate Analysis Service, September 2000, United
   States Average Annual Precipitation, 1961-1990, in National Atlas of
   the United States, http://nationalatlas.gov.

   15. I use a geographic information system (GIS). Can I order National
   Atlas map layers?

   Yes. Nearly all map layers presented within our online, interactive
   mapping system are available now. You can download these map layers at
   no cost using file transfer protocol or you may pay to have them
   delivered on compact disc. Follow this link for more information about
   downloading National Atlas map layers.

   16. Is the old National Atlas still available?

   No. The National Atlas of the United States of America® published by
   the USGS in 1970, is out of print. However, the Library of Congress has
   added the original National Atlas to its American Memory collection on
   the World Wide Web. Please follow this link to browse through the
   earlier atlas.
   Also, many maps from the 1970 edition can be purchased separately.
   Follow this link for information on older National Atlas maps.
   To locate a USGS map dealer near you, follow this link. Used or antique
   book stores are possible sources for the original National Atlas.
   Reference copies are available in many libraries.

   17. Is the National Atlas mapping the West Nile Virus again in 2001?

   No. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is mapping West Nile
   Virus in 2001. Follow this link for information on 2001 WNV maps.
