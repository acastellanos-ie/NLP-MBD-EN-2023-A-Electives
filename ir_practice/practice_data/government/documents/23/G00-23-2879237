     USTR Underlines Need
     for Trade Promotion Authority

        The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) issued December 3 a
        fact sheet outlining a timetable for trade talks following the World
        Trade Organization's (WTO) decision to launch a new round of global
        negotiations.

        USTR has emphasized the need for Congress to approve trade promotion
        authority (TPA) that would give the president more leeway to negotiate
        trade agreements while restricting Congress to approving or rejecting
        them, within strict time limits and without amendments. Fact Sheet

     Doha Set Stage for
     Agriculture Reform, Veneman Says


     Ann Veneman U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman at WTO meeting in
                                                             Doha. (AP/WWP)

        The Doha declaration launching new global trade talks sets the stage
        for agriculture reform that will substantially reduce tariffs, increase
        market access and reduce trade distorting subsidies, Agriculture Ann
        Veneman says.

        "We went into the negotiations in Doha saying we would aggressively
        seek language that would tear down the walls that other countries have
        built that hurt our farmers -- particularly the large export subsidies
        of the European Union," she said.

        Speaking November 28 to a meeting sponsored by the Farm Journal,
        Veneman also said homeland security and the protection of U.S. farms
        and food systems are receiving increasing attention since September 11.

     Results of the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference

        Trade Ministers representing over 140 countries met from November 9-14
        at the 4th World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Doha,
        Qatar.

        The ambitious agenda calls for a comprehensive 3-year negotiation (to
        be concluded by 2005), covering a variety of areas affecting
        international business and commerce, such as agriculture, services,
        industrial tariffs, investment, and environmentally harmful fishing
        subsidies.
