        INTRODUCTION

        The Research Services Branch is currently comprised of the Office of
        the Chief and the Section on Instrumentation and Computers. The Section
        on Instrumentation and Computers provides broad technical support for
        the Intramural Research Programs of NIMH and NINDS by: (1) assessing
        the instrumentation, computer and networking needs of intramural staff;
        (2) designing, developing and constructing special-purpose
        instrumentation; (3) specifying, evaluating, selecting, installing,
        configuring, and managing personal computers, workstations, and
        multiuser servers; (4) specifying, designing and developing custom
        software for scientific and administrative applications; (5) managing a
        central computer facility consisting of UNIX and Windows NT servers, an
        image processing system, and a user area with Macintosh and
        IBM-compatible personal computers, scanners, and monochrome and color
        printers; and (6) developing and managing computer networks in the
        Weicker, Conte, and Clinical Center Buildings. In addition, Section
        personnel provide consultation and assistance in areas relating to
        basic and clinical research, including measurement and analysis
        techniques, signal processing, applied mathematics, statistics,
        laboratory and office computer techniques, and equipment and ADP
        purchases.

        INSTRUMENTATION

        The Section has a staff of engineers and technicians that design and
        fabricate custom electronic and electromechanical devices and
        instruments. Most of our efforts involve animal and human activity
        monitoring and stimulation systems, cellular perfusion controllers,
        multichannel amplifier, pulse generator, and stimulator systems, and
        computer and instrument interfaces. The Section's engineering,
        fabrication and machine shop operations are located in Building 13.
          __________________________________________________________________

        MACHINE SHOP FACILITY

        The Section maintains a well-equipped machine shop specialized for
        working with metals and synthetic materials. This facility is critical
        to the development and fabrication of the electronic and
        electromechanical instrumentation projects described above. Our machine
        shop is equipped with a Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) milling
        machine and Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing
        (CAD/CAM) programs. The CNC mill and the CAD/CAM software are used by
        our staff to design and produce a wide range of machined parts. Many of
        these parts could not be produced with manual milling operations, and
        all of them benefit from the efficiency and precision of automated
        machining. The machine shop is located in Building 13.
          __________________________________________________________________

        CENTRAL COMPUTER FACILITY

        The Section maintains a central computing facility with five Macintosh
        computers, three Windows workstation, a laser printer, a Tektronix
        Phaser 340 plain-paper color printer, three flatbed scanners, and a
        Polaroid slide scanner. All the machines have Ethernet network
        connections and are capable of communicating and sharing files with
        machines on the Internet. More than 35 software applications are
        available on the Joe Public server for intramural staff to use for
        mathematical and statistical analysis, word and image processing, and
        for the creation of posters, slides, charts, graphs, and images. The
        Phaser 340 provides the users with fast, inexpensive laser-quality
        color prints. The Section also supports a Tektronix Phaser 450 dye
        sublimation printer for the production of publication-ready
        continuous-tone color prints.

        One of the Macintoshes in the Personal Computer Facility is configured
        as an image processing system with a video camera and lightbox. This
        system, with NIH Image as the core program, is used for numerous
        applications, including analysis of CT, MRI or PET images, receptor
        binding studies, analysis of electrophoretic gels, and quantitative
        evaluation of cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism, or protein
        synthesis.
          __________________________________________________________________

        NETWORKS

        The Section manages a large, multi-protocol network in the Weicker
        Building comprised of two large and two small Ethernet subnets. A
        remote access server with 12 28.8 KBaud modems is also managed to
        provide full AppleTalk and PPP network connections for over 300
        registered users who dial in from home or remote sites.

        The Section also manages a PC-based Ethernet network, including
        Microsoft Exchange, that supports NIMH DIRP administrative, budget and
        personnel functions. This LAN supports users within the Offices of the
        Scientific Director and the Clinical Director, the Budget Office, the
        Personnel Office and the Administrative Offices in the Clinical Center,
        and in the Conte Building. This administrative LAN provides users the
        benefits of standard software applications and easy sharing of files,
        printers and other resources within their local working groups.
          __________________________________________________________________

        SERVERS (Codon, Joe Public, RSBNT)

        The Section manages a Sun Enterprise 3000 (Codon), with over 1000
        registered users, as our primary POP3 mail server and as a platform for
        the comprehensive DNA and protein sequence analysis software from the
        Genetic Computing Group.

        An AppleShare file server (Joe Public) is provided by the Section as a
        software application server and as clearinghouse for Macintosh software
        and documents useful to intramural staff. Joe Public contains demos of
        commercial programs, shareware applications, and a variety of popular
        free programs. Users can also take advantage of a large temporary
        storage space to exchange files with other colleagues.

        RSBNT is a PC-based Microsoft Windows NT server that provides two
        important services: PC users can now access numerous AppleTalk
        printers, both in their own labs and in the Section's central
        facilities; and PC and Mac users can use the large disk space to
        exchange files between the two types of platforms.

        PERSONAL COMPUTERS

        IBM-compatible personal computers (PCs) and Macintosh computers have
        become essential research tools. They are widely used in the intramural
        laboratories for data acquisition, experimental control, mathematical
        and statistical data analysis, graphics, image processing, word
        processing, and communication over local networks and the Internet.
        They are also used in all intramural offices for administrative
        functions and for the preparation of scientific publications. The
        Section provides consultation on the specification and selection of
        these systems and provides on-site support to help increase their
        effective utilization. The hardware support available includes setup
        and testing of new systems; installing floppy drives, hard drives,
        CD-ROM and tape drives, memory SIMMs, and video and Ethernet cards;
        diagnosing hardware component malfunctions; and recovering data from
        damaged floppy and hard drives. Software support includes installing
        new versions and upgrades of operating systems, application programs
        and network software; configuring the operating system, applications
        and network software to function together and to provide access to
        local, NIH, and Internet network services; and detecting and
        eliminating computer viruses. On-site support also often involves
        advice and training to further aid the user.

        COLLABORATIVE SUPPORT

        Section specialists provide collaborative support for selected research
        projects through expertise in experimental design, software
        development, and statistical and mathematical analysis.
