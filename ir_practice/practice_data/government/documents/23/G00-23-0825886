                                     California Historic Sites and Structures

   Leland Stanford State Historic Park The historic era has left a wealth
   of structures, features and sites of immeasurable importance to the
   citizens of California. Mission period adobes, Russian frontier forts,
   gold-rush era sites, ghost towns, early shipwrecks, unique structures,
   industrial sites and "gold diggins" are but a few of the many
   significant historical resources to be found in California's parks.

   Like archaeological sites, artifacts and historic documents, historic
   buildings have great potential to provide important insight into
   historic people and lifeways, as well as architectural history.
   Historic buildings are not static entities, but have often grown and
   changed extensively since their initial construction.  As such, they
   must be viewed not simply as an example of a particular architectural
   style, but as the end products of complex evolutionary processes.

   Buildings frequently embody valuable evidence about their earlier
   configuration, inhabitants, and uses.  Discovering and recording that
   evidence is similar in many ways to the procedures used by
   archaeologists to understand more traditional buried sites.  In the
   State Park System, detailed studies of historic buildings are
   frequently undertaken by architects, archaeologists and historians to
   provide the information needed to plan restoration and interpretation,
   and to document historic features before they are modified or replaced
   during modern renovation efforts.

   Recent historic building studies in California state parks are
   discussed in the following web pages
