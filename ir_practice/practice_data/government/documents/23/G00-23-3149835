   The Indianapolis Field Office is the OSM office responsible for
   coordinating between OSM and State Regulatory Authorities, citizens,
   the coal industry and environmental concerns in the States of  Indiana
   and Illinois.   State coal regulatory and abandoned mine land programs
   are monitored to ensure that surface coal mining operations and the
   surface effects of underground coal mining and the reclamation of
   abandoned mine lands are conducted in an environmentally sound manner.

   The Field Office Director (FOD) is responsible for all activities of
   the Indianapolis Field Office and for financial management and property
   and acquisition management. The IFO consists of the Director, two
   program specialists, two program assistants, two inspectors, a
   secretary, a computer specialist and a hydrologist.

                              PROGRAM FUNCTIONS

   The IFO Program staff is responsible for gathering data about coal
   mining and reclamation operations in each of the states, assisting the
   states under the IFO jurisdiction in improving inspection and
   enforcement activities and recommending actions needed to address
   program deficiencies. The accomplishment of these tasks will assist the
   States in the implementation of programs and ensure proper reclamation
   of the land. The Program Staff:
     * Reviews and analyzes proposed state program amendments and monitors
       and evaluates State regulatory programs, cooperative agreements and
       abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation programs.
     * Assists in resolving identified program issues within each of the
       states.
     * Works with each state to develop an annual performance agreement
       which defines the oversight and assistance activities for the
       current evaluation year.
     * Solicits stakeholder comments concerning oversight, conducts
       performance reviews in accordance with the negotiated performance
       agreement, inspects mines in accordance with existing OSM policy,
       citizen concerns or concerns from routine program and document
       review.
     * Provides technical assistance, or access to technical assistance on
       issues relating to mine permitting, compliance monitoring,
       mitigation, AML issues or reclamation decisions.
     * Reviews grant documents and assures programmatic compliance with
       all grant conditions.
     * Assists the States in aggressively pursuing reclamation of the most
       serious and high priority non-emergency AML sites.
     * Participates in technical forums, meetings, and conferences to
       maintain technical expertise and stay abreast of developments in
       mining and reclamation technology.

    Below is a brief profile of  the states covered by our office.

                                   INDIANA

   Coal mining in Indiana is limited to the southwestern portion of the
   State with coal currently being mined in 12 counties. The coal
   producing area of the State covers approximately 6500 square miles. The
   coal mining industry provides a strong economic base in these primarily
   agricultural counties by providing employment and through purchase of
   mining related equipment, goods and services.

   In recent years, coal production has ranged from 28 to 35 million tons.
   Coal mining operations in the State range from small mines of less than
   100 acres to larger area mines of 10,000 acres or more. While most of
   the coal in Indiana is removed by surface mining methods, an increasing
   amount is being removed through underground mining.

   According to the Indiana Coal Council, about 40% of the known surface
   coal reserves has been removed. Estimates are that Indiana has about 34
   billion tons of unmined coal remaining. Of this, only 18 billion tons
   is recoverable using current technology.

                                  ILLINOIS

   Recoverable bituminous coal reserves in Illinois are estimated to be
   about 30 billion tons. Sixty-four percent of the StateÂ’s area is
   underlain by coal bearing Pennsylvanian Era Rock. Surface, underground
   and auger mining methods are used in Illinois to extract the coal. The
   amount of coal mined in Illinois in 1997 was 41.1 million tons. This
   represents a decrease of 8.3 million tons from 1996.

   There are currently 21 active coal mines in Illinois, 5 surface and 16
   underground. While there is no active surface mining occurring on
   Federal Lands in Illinois, there is currently 1 active long wall
   underground mine, and 4 inactive underground mines located on these
   lands.
