  [world.gif] Tropospheric ozone production in the Northern Hemisphere: the
  North Atlantic Regional Experiment (NARE)

   [bluebar.gif]

   In the 1990s, the Aeronomy Lab participated in a major international
   field and modeling campaign that has shown that human-made chemicals
   are responsible for the generation of ozone in the troposphere over the
   North Atlantic Ocean. The research addresses the growing concern that
   ozone and its precursors (the "starting ingredients," volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides) are transported from the North
   American continent and can influence ozone on a hemispheric scale,
   where it acts as one of the gases that could perturb the Earth's
   radiation budget.

   The effort was part of the North Atlantic Regional Experiment (NARE),
   an activity of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project
   (IGAC). In field intensives starting in 1991, comprehensive chemical
   and dynamical measurements have been made from several airborne
   platforms and from various ground-based stations along the Atlantic
   Seaboard and spanning the northern Atlantic Ocean. The measurements
   tracked the changing composition of air masses containing pollutants
   from eastern North America as these air masses were carried across the
   North Atlantic. By measuring carbon monoxide, ozone, and other trace
   gases, the researchers have shown that the "seeds" of the summertime
   ozone are the human-made precursors emitted from the heavily populated
   regions of the North American Continent.

   Members of the Tropospheric Chemistry and Theoretical Aeronomy Projects
   of the Aeronomy Lab have played leading roles not only in the field and
   modeling components of NARE, but also in its design and organization.

   Evidence of Anthropogenic Ozone Production and Export. Measurements of
   ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) at three sites in the North Atlantic
   have shown that summertime ozone is produced from human emissions of
   "precursor" (ingredient) gases from the North American continent.
   Carbon monoxide is an anthropogenic pollutant that is relatively
   unreactive (lifetime: about 1 month in the summer) and can be used as a
   "tracer" of human-made pollution. The measured relations between the
   concentrations of O[3] and CO in the air carried over the North
   Atlantic, coupled with the inventoried emissions of CO in eastern North
   America, leads to the estimate that approximately 10 billion pounds of
   ozone are exported per summer from the North American continent. This
   amount is greater than that reaching the lower troposphere in this
   region from the stratosphere, which is the primary natural source of
   ozone.
