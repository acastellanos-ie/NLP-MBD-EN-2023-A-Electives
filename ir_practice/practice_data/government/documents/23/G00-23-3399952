               Frequently Asked Questions - Search

   Q. Which Web sites are searched?
   A. The search results cover Farm Service Agency (FSA), Natural
   Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and Rural Development (RD) Web
   sites, but not USDA Web sites. The USDA Web site has a separate search
   page.

   Q. Why don't the search results include a page I'm sure exists?
   A. To make the system respond quickly to your requests, we crawl the
   Web sites once a week and make catalogs of the results. These catalogs
   are updated once a week, so
     * the page could be too new to be in the catalog
     * the page could have been recently moved
     * links to the page are broken
     * the page has been deleted.

   It's also possible the page is not on our list of sites to crawl, since
   the site owner must specifically request that their site be included.
