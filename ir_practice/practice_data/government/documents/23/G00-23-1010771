   The Mayor's Plan for Economic Vitality

   "On Sunday, September 23, 2001, American flags returned to full staff,
   a message thatwhile our nation is still in mourningit is time to
   return to the business of America. In the District, that means helping
   our young people succeed in school, improving our emergency and
   terrorism response plans, and restoring the vitality of our
   fundamentally strong economy." — Mayor Anthony A. Williams

   In response to the events of September 11, Mayor Williams has
   instituted an immediate action plan to guide us from economic
   uncertainty to financial stability once again. His efforts will focus
   on promoting tourism and business, awarding unemployment assistance,
   preserving jobs, and preserving our current economic development
   projects.

   This page will serve as a timely resource for the steps Mayor Williams
   is taking to keep the District's economy strong.
