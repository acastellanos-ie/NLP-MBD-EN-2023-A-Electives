   The USGS has two options for acquiring 1:24,000-Scale (7.5-minute)
   Digital Elevation Model data.
   1) The original DEM 7.5 minute tiled data available only in Spatial
   Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) form is available at no cost via
   downloads from the GeoComm International Corporation at
   http://gisdatadepot.com/dem and from MapMart.com at
   http://www.mapmart.com. (See disclaimer).
   2) The National Elevation Dataset (NED) is the result of the maturation
   of the USGS effort to provide 1:24,000-scale Digital Elevation Model
   (DEM) data for the conterminous U.S. and 1:63,360-scale DEM data for
   Alaska in a seamless form. Available data formats include ArcGrid,
   Floating Point, and BILS. For more information see (30m NED button), or
   go directly to the Seamless Data Distribution System at (Seamless
   Store).

   Files are not directly viewable!          Close this window
   Note: These data files are for use in geographical information
   systems(GIS) for analysis and integration with other geospatial data.
   They are not directly viewable using WWW browser or image viewing
   tools. The USGS offers free software for viewing some digital
   cartographic products, including DLG-O, DEM, DLG/SDTS and DRG data.
   These viewers run on Windows 95/NT only. They are tools for data
   preview, and are not substitutes for commercial geographic information
   system software. Available display software may be found in the "Public

   FTP File Access                   Close this window
   The EROS Data Center provides file transfer protocol (FTP) access to a
   variety of USGS digital data sets. The following is a list of each data
   set and includes: a link to data examples, a hyperlink to user guide
   information, and a list of the methods available for transferring the
   data using FTP. You can download files by connecting to the data set's
   anonymous FTP account and selecting files from the existing directory
   structure (FTP from account), by selecting from a list of states that
   will guide you to the appropriate files (FTP sorted by state), or by
   using the graphic option which allows you to select files using an
   index map (Graphics FTP). Not all FTP options are available for each
   data set. The user guide provides detailed information about the data
   set, including distribution formats.
   If you use FTP from account, be sure to review the README (or 00README)
   file located in the first directory you encounter.

   Effective July 1, 1996               Close this window
   NOTICE: Effective July 1, 1996, the U.S. Geological Survey discontinued
   providing the Digital Line Graph (DLG-S) data in the Standard format.
   The Digital Line Graph (DLG-O) data in the Optional (Native) format
   will continue to be available. The newer Spatial Data Transfer Standard
   (SDTS) format availability will continue to increase as data are
   converted and/or produced in this format.

   Note                        Close this window
   Due to an error in processing, some 7.5' DEM files may contain an
   incorrect compilation method and version number. The problem is being
   corrected. To determine if a file has incurred this error, you may
   query the Global Land Information System and check the comment field of
   the detail window.

   Note: Name Changes                Close this window
   Note: The file names have been changed to match the file naming
   structure from the production centers. A cross reference from the old
   naming convention to the new naming convention is available for
   optional (native) and SDTS formats.

   30 Meter Resolution National Elevation Dataset   Close this window
   Merging the highest-resolution, best-quality elevation data available
   across the United States into a seamless raster format has developed
   the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED). NED is the result of the
   maturation of the USGS effort to provide 1:24,000-scale Digital
   Elevation Model (DEM) data for the conterminous US and 1:63,360-scale
   DEM data for Alaska. Seamless Data Distribution System (SDDS) offers
   seamless data for sale, by user-defined area, in a variety of formats.

   Disclaimer                     Close this window
   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has entered into an agreement with
   the GeoCommunity and MapMart.com to serve updated, SDTS format, Digital
   Elevation Models (DEMs) through the GIS Data Depot at
   http://www.gisdatadepot.com and http://www.mapmart.com for no charge.
   The 7.5' SDTS DEM data are also available for purchase via premium
   (fast) download and on CD-ROM from GeoCommunity.
   The decision to provide SDTS DEMs through commercial vendors is
   consistent with the USGS goal of making more public domain data
   available at no charge while enabling the private sector to have a
   greater role in the distribution of USGS data. SDTS DEMs placed on
   media in response to customer orders will be sold by the GeoCommunity
   at a price less than the USGS currently charges.
   The GeoCommunity and MapMart.com will continue to receive SDTS versions
   of the DEMs as they are made available by the USGS. Native format DEMs
   are still available for sale from USGS on various media and via ftp.
   If you have additional questions or comments, please contact us at
   sdts@usgs.gov. Please monitor the SDTS Home Page for further news and
   updates on this issue. http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/sdts
