   How Does Your Building's Energy Use Compare?
   How does your building's energy use compare to that of other buildings?
   Cal-Arch provides a simple way to see how your building's energy use
   compares to similar buildings. Currently you may compare your building
   to buildings in one of eighteen activity categories. These can be
   further filtered to compare only buildings with similar floor area and
   location.

   You may leave any of the fields blank, except for building activity.
   Note that providing more information will narrow the buildings in the
   comparison to those more closely matching your building. Providing less
   information will result in a greater number of buildings to compare
   your building to. Note: With the current database size, filtering on
   both floor area and climate zone is not advised.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Step One:
   What is the principle activity of your building?
   [Office/Professional ________________]

   Step Two:
   Enter the zipcode of your building. _______
   If a zip code is entered, only buildings within the same climate zone
   will be displayed. Use this field only if your building is within PG&E
   service territory.

   Step Three:
   Enter the building's floor area. _______ (gross square feet)
   If both floor area and energy use are entered, an EUI will be
   calculated for your building and displayed on the graph. To display
   only buildings with comparable floor area check here [ ] . Buildings
   are considered to have comparable floor areas if they have between half
   and twice your area.

   Step Four:
   If both annual energy use and floor area are entered, your EUI will be
   calculated and displayed relative to comparison buildings. Enter the
   annual energy consumption based on the utility bills for your building
   for each of the following fuels:

   Fuel        Energy Consumption
   Electricity 0______[kWh/year ]
   Natural Gas 0______[therms/year _____]
   Other       0______Million Btu/year

   Step Five:
   Building energy use can be reported as the actual energy used on site,
   or as the energy used at the energy source (about 2/3 of the "primary
   energy" that goes into an electric power plant is lost in the process
   as waste heat).
   Select which you want to use: (*) Site  ( ) Source

   Step Six:
   Data entered on this website is saved and may later be added to our
   database.
   If you are entering real data and think they would be useful to add to
   our database, please check here:  [ ] .
