     * Collaborative Drug Therapy Agreements to Promote Public Health -
       One of the ways to increase access to services that improve public
       health is through Pharmacists. Pharmacists in Washington state have
       prescriptive authority through collaborative drug therapy
       agreements with physicians. A successful example of this service is
       how pharmacists in Washington are helping to make Emergency
       Contraceptive Pills more accessible to clients who need them.
     * Family Planning and Reproductive Health
     * Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)
       Definition: A permanent birth defect syndrome caused by maternal
       consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. FAS is characterized by
       growth deficiency, cognitive/behavioral problems, and a unique
       cluster of facial features. FAS is the leading known cause of
       mental retardation, and while its effects never go away, early
       diagnosis and intervention reduces the secondary disabilities
       associated with it.
       Diagnosis and Treatment: is available at the University of
       Washington FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN). This
       network, of clinics focuses on screening, diagnosis, and prevention
       of FAS and its secondary disabilities. The FAS DPN include seven
       clinics, including community-based diagnostic clinics in Pierce,
       Snohomish, Spokane, south King, Whitman and Yakima counties.
       Information on FAS and the FAS DPN is available at:
