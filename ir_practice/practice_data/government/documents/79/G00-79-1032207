                                Perkins Loans

     A
   Federal Perkins Loan is a low-interest (5 percent) loan for both
   undergraduate and graduate students with exceptional financial need.
   Your school is your lender. The loan is disbursed using government
   funds with a share contributed by your school. You must repay this loan
   to your school.

   A Perkins Loan borrower is not charged any servicing fees. However, if
   you skip a payment, make a payment late, or make less than a full
   payment, you may incur a late charge plus any collection costs. Late
   charges will continue until your payments are current.
