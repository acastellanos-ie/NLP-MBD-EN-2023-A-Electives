     Notification to Potential Members of Class Action Suit


   NOTIFICATION TO POTENTIAL MEMBERS
          OF CLASS COMPLAINT

   On May 9, 2001, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
   accepted a class complaint alleging non-promotion and non-selection of
   all Native American women employed by the Indian Health Service (IHS)
   since April 12, 1996, in technical and professional positions above
   GS-7. EEOC has made no determination on the merits of the class
   complaint. In the near future, an EEOC Administrative Judge will
   preside over a hearing on the class complaint. A final decision on the
   class complaint shall, subject to appeal, be binding on all members of
   the class and the Agency.

   ELIGIBILITY  To be eligible to be part of the class complaint, the
   following criteria must be met: a Native American woman employed by the
   Indian Health Service at any time since April 12, 1996, in a
   professional or technical position above GS-7 and who the agency failed
   or refused to promote due to disparate treatment, including the failure
   to provide an opportunity to compete for vacancies that are routinely
   filled non-competitively through the reassignment of males or
   non-Native Americans, pre-selection, generally classifying women lower
   than men who are doing the same or similar work, or subordinating the
   qualifications of women by not selecting them when they are most
   qualified to fill vacant positions. [ top ]

   NONELIGIBILITY  Native American women employed by the Indian Health
   Service, since April 12, 1996, as a U.S. Public Health Service
   Commissioned Corps Officer, or a Federal employee under direct hire
   with a tribal organization, or as an IPA/MOA employee with a tribal
   organization are ineligible to be a part of the class complaint. [ top
   ]

   If you meet the criteria for eligibility, please provide in writing
   your qualifying information, including contact information (such as
   name, address, and telephone number), to:

   Dennis Chappabitty
   Attorney at Law, Class Complaint Representative
   Sara Crazythunder (aka Sara Crazythunder-Collier), Class Agent
   P.O. Box 292122
   Sacramento, California 95829
   Telephone: (916) 682-0575
