   Patient Safety at the Clinical Interface

      Background Information

      In response to the Institute of Medicines (IOM) report, To Err is
      Human: Building a Safer Health System, the Quality Interagency
      Coordination Task Force (QuIC) endorsed the IOMs recommendation for
      making a national priority of enhancing the existing knowledge base in
      the area of patient safety. In particular, the QuIC called for a
      National Summit on Medical Errors and Patient Safety Research, which
      was held in Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2000, to begin the
      process of setting a national research agenda.

      During the National Summit, which had representation from diverse
      interest groups (e.g., consumers, state and local policymakers,
      purchasers, health care professionals, and researchers), the QuIC and
      other patient safety funding organizations heard from the users of
      patient safety research about their pressing needs and the specific
      research questions related to those needs. To ensure that the users
      input led to a coordinated privatepublic action plan by funders of
      patient safety research, representatives from 14 public- and
      private-sector organizations that fund patient safety research were
      asked review the input from the users. After the review, the
      representatives met to develop an integrated, coordinated, user-driven,
      patient-focused, system-based patient safety research agenda. Given the
      extent of both the users comments as well as of the patient safety
      field, the current Preliminary Research Agenda is rather broad in
      scope. Future discussions and meetings, such as "Patient Safety at the
      Clinical Interface," have been scheduled to provide more detail for the
      current research framework.

      "Patient Safety at the Clinical Interface" was designed:
        * To obtain feedback concerning the Preliminary Research Agenda
          produced from the National Summit.
        * To articulate in greater depth some of the key issues that
          clinicians want to have researched so that they can improve patient
          safety.
        * To explore the role of the professional societies in reducing
          errors.
        * To discuss means by which to address various implementation issues.

      To reach those stated objectives, the basic format for the meeting
      involved two different sets of breakout sessionswith a focus on
      research topics as well as implementation issuesand a working lunch
      focused on the patient/consumer research agenda. In each of the
      breakout sessions, a member from one of the 14 funders of patient
      safety research at the National Summit served as a moderator while two
      other individuals with differing viewpoints served to catalyze the
      discussion.

      In an effort to capture the meeting discussion, a preliminary summary
      of the meeting is currently available (Word® file, 139 KB). Comments
      and suggestions about this summary may be submitted to Shana Christrup,
      (301) 594-6673 (SChristrup@ahrq.gov) until January 2, 2001. After that
      time, the AHRQ staff will be working to finalize the summary and to
      produce a meeting monograph.

      Printed copies of the final summary will be available at the Agency for
      Healthcare Research and Qualitys Clearinghouse in mid-January 2001. To
      request a copy of the summary, please call the Clearinghouse's
      toll-free number 800-358-9295 or write to AHRQ Publications
      Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 8547, Silver Spring, MD 20907-8547. Callers
