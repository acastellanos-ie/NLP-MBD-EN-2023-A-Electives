   Atmospheric Sciences Modeling Division

   The Atmospheric Sciences Modeling Division (ASMD) of NOAA's Air
   Resources Laboratory (ARL) was established to collaborate with the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in developing advanced air
   quality models that can simulate the transport and fate of pollutants
   in the atmosphere. The ASMD's mission is to develop and evaluate
   predictive models on all spatial and temporal scales for assessing
   changes in air quality and air pollutant exposures, as affected by
   changes in ecosystem management and regulatory decisions. The models
   developed by ASMD are being used by EPA and the general air pollution
   community in understanding not only the magnitude of the air pollution
   problem, but also in developing emission control policies and
   regulations. The ASMD is responsible for providing sound scientific and
   technical basis for regulatory policies.

   Established in 1955, ASMD serves as the vehicle for implementing the
   agreements with EPA, which funds the research efforts in air pollution
   meteorology and atmospheric modeling. The Division conducts atmospheric
   research in-house and through contract and cooperative agreements. With
   a staff of about 50 NOAA meteorologists and 10 EPA scientists, Division
   provides technical information, observational and forecasting support,
   and consulting on all meteorological aspects of the air pollution
   control program to many EPA offices in the country. ASMD scientists are
   currently assigned to EPA's National Exposure Research Laboratory
   (NERL) and Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS).

   In addition to facilitating in-house research in the fields of air
   pollution meteorology and atmospheric modeling, ASMD interacts
   extensively with academic and other scientific institutions in the
   country and abroad to help support NOAA's and EPA's mission-oriented
   efforts as well as to ensure that the environmental community has the
   benefit of the highest quality peer-reviewed science in dealing with
   air pollution problems.
