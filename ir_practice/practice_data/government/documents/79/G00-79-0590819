   TDA funds project planning activities that directly influence the
   procurement decisions related to major industrial or infrastructure
   projects in developing and middle-income countries - projects that
   typically represent millions of dollars in U.S. export potential. From
   radar for airports in Asia to process controls for refineries in Latin
   America, hundreds of goods and services are required to implement a
   project. TDA works to ensure that the services and products needed for
   projects will be stamped "Made in the U.S.A."

   All TDA activities are carried out by U.S. firms. The following is a
   brief summary of the activites that TDA funds:

   FEASIBILITY STUDIES - TDA's primary tool for getting U.S. firms in on
   the "ground floor" of major projects abroad is the funding of
   feasibility studies. Feasibility studies examine the technical, legal,
   economic, and finanical aspects of a development project in the concept
   stage.

   Study grants are signed directly with the host country project sponsor
   on the condition that an American firm will be selected to perform the
   study.

   When U.S. companies compete in project development, they are likely to
   be selected when the contracts are awared to supply goods and services
   to implement the project.

   DEFINITIONAL MISSIONS & DESK STUDIES - Almost all feasibility studies
   are preceded by either a Definitional Mission or a Desk Study. TDA
   contracts directly with a small or minority U.S. business to provide
   preliminary information about a proposed study and project.

   Definitional Missions (DMs) are comprised of teams of technical
   specialists contracted for a short-term visit to a host country. Their
   task is to gather additional information on the project.

   Desk Studies (DSs) also involve information gathering and analysis;
   however, they do not require overseas travel by the specialist.

   Based on the recommendations contained in the definitional mission or
   desk study, the advice of the U.S. Embassy, TDA's internal analysis,
   and budget capabilities, the agency decides on funding requests by
   feasibility studies.

   TDA also sponsors conferences and reverse trade missions called
   "orientation visits." Both of these activities familiarize foreign
   decision makers with American-made products and services, build
   business relationships, and encourage U.S. companies to export to
   developing and middle-income countries.

   In certain regions, TDA also funds trade-related training, which
   enables host country project personnel to receive technical and
   managerial training when a U.S. firm is selected to implement a
   project. Technical assistance is funded by TDA in some situations where
   the complex demands of a given project require expertise that is
   unavailable from the host country.
