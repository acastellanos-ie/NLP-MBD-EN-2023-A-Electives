   Instrument Remote Control

   Background

      Goddard Space Flight Center's Instrument Remote Control (IRC) project
      is an ongoing effort led by the Advanced Architectures and Automations
      Branch (Code 588). IRC supports NASA's mission by defining an adaptive
      framework that provides robust interactive and distributed control and
      monitoring of remote instruments. IRC will eventually enable trusted
      astronomers from around the world to easily access infrared instruments
      (e.g., telescopes, cameras, and spectrometers) located in remote,
      inhospitable environments, such as the South Pole, a high mountaintop,
      or an airborne observatory. The IRC framework will ultimately enable
      astronomers, instrument designers, hardware engineers, and other
      scientists to define onboard instruments, to control the instruments
      remotely, and to monitor vital instrument telemetry over an intranet
      or, for trusted users, possibly the Internet.

      IRC technology will be making its debut as an operational solution on
      an actual twenty-year NASA mission. The initial effort is targeted for
      the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) project, a
      Boeing 747-SP aircraft modified to accommodate a 2.5 meter reflecting
      telescope. In 2001, SOFIA will be the largest airborne telescope in the
      world. One of the first light instruments named HAWC (High Resolution
      Airborne Wideband Camera), is the first focus of our technology.

   Goals

        * Enabling access of infrared astronomical instruments located in
          remote, inhospitable environments.
        * Configurable software architecture supporting instrument remote
          control.
        * Easy to develop, modify, maintain, extend.
        * Distributed - assign processes to different computers, regardless
          of operating system.

   History

        * Instrument Remote Control (IRC) began as a small prototyping effort
          for CARA at the South Pole in 1997.
        * Developed a distributed architecture and Graphical User Inteface to
          remotely control heaters attached to a telescope located at the
          South Pole.
        * Early 1998: Idea to describe instrument control via XML (Extensible
          Markup Language).
        * Mid 1998: Began SOFIA HAWC effort.
        * Feb. 1999: Completed HAWC prototype.
        * Feb. 1999: Began ESA SPIRE effort.
