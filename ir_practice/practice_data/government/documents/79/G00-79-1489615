                        ANL Reactor Engineering Division

  Systems and Components Development Expertise

   The Reactor Engineering Division has demonstrated expertise in applying
   a wide range of engineering disciplines and design methods to the
   development of first-of-a-kind large-scale systems and components with
   complex requirements including corrosive and hazardous materials,
   high-temperature structural integrity, vacuum and pressure conditions,
   and remote handling operations.

   Division engineers and scientists have developed systems and components
   from the conceptual design stage through manufacture and qualification
   testing. Procedures were developed and followed during the entire
   process to ensure that the equipment met operational requirements,
   applicable codes and standards, and the interface requirements with
   other equipment and facilities. Detailed documentation was maintained
   for procurement, installation, operations and maintenance.

Recent Projects

   The conceptual designs in recent projects utilized knowledge of basic
   science and chemical thermodynamics to identify phase transformations
   during molten metal and molten salt process cycles.
     * Materials tests were performed to resolve the unique problems of
       materials compatibility caused by the corrosive materials and the
       high temperature and vacuum conditions.
     * Scaled simulation experiments were conducted to verify the design
       concepts.
     * Finite element radiation heat transfer analyses were performed to
       determine the internal temperatures.
     * Detailed stress analyses were performed for operational, seismic,
       and thermal loads to ensure structural integrity and to prevent
       unacceptable thermal distortions or seal failures.
     * Electromagnetic calculations, with finite element computer codes
       and empirical methods, were used to design an induction heating
       coil and a shield to protect a pressure vessel wall from
       eddy-current heating.
     * Computer control strategies were developed to use measured internal
       pressures and temperatures to control process operations and ensure
       safety.
     * To meet the requirements for remote operations, the systems were
       designed to be operated and maintained using mechanical
       manipulators and cranes.
