                          harmony between agriculture and the environment

            Scenes of conservation and environment, USDA photos.

                                  overview
      Understanding links between farm economics and the use of natural
   resources is critical to fostering greater harmony between agriculture
     and ecosystems that support us and other species. Research can help
        find ways in which agricultural competitiveness and economic
     development can coexist with the natural resource base and enhanced
      environmental quality. Federal policies must constantly evolve to
     promote stewardship in light of new opportunities for productivity
   growth, resource-saving technologies, and threats to biodiversity. More

    Food and Agricultural PolicyTaking Stock for the New Century: This
   USDA report recognizes that the success of the Nation's agriculture and
      food system is the result of farsighted planning, investment, and
   policy decisions. Taking a long-term view, USDA sets out principles for
      equipping the food and agriculture sector to operate in a modern
    business environment that is globally integrated, highly competitive,
   technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious, and which must
              respond to increasingly sophisticated consumers.

     [biofeature.jpg] Economic Issues in Agricultural BiotechnologyNew
   developments in marketing and contractual arrangements between farmers
     and grain and food processors will likely become critical issues as
     more genetically engineered (GE) crops enter the marketplace. This
      report explores some implications for grades and standards for GE
      products, as well as the extent of biotechnology adoption by U.S.
      farmers and some of the farm-level effects. Other topics include
      important advances in biological science, the roles of public and
      private research, and recent changes in input industry structure.

   Adoption of Agricultural Production Practices: Lessons Learned from the
       U.S. Department of Agriculture Area Studies ProjectData for 12
        watersheds across the Nation were analyzed using a consistent
    methodological approach to study the constraints associated with the
     adoption of micronutrients, N-testing, split nitrogen applications,
   green manure, biological pest controls, pest-resistant varieties, crop
   rotations, pheromones, scouting, conservation tillage, contour farming,
             strip cropping, grassed waterways, and irrigation.

    Agri-Environmental Policy at the Crossroads: Guideposts on a Changing
     LandscapeEmerging agri-environmental concerns, flux in farm income
   support programs, and limits imposed on policy by trade agreements are
     among factors suggesting a shift in agri-environmental policy. This
      report identifies the implications of alternative policy options,
      focusing especially on agri-environmental payments. How income is
   distributed and how much environmental quality gets improved both vary
     substantially by program design features. Such features include how
      goals are specified, how eligibility for payments is defined, and
   whether payment levels are determined by benefits derived from or costs
                       incurred by approved practices.
