   The VA HyperFAQ (Hypertext-based Frequently Asked Questions) index is
   an easy, simplified way to navigate through the top 200 sites on
   www.va.gov. You'll answer no more than seven questions about the
   information you want, and the HyperFAQ will recommend web sites based
   on your answers. You can quit, return to the beginning, or send a
   message to the VA at any location in the HyperFAQ.
