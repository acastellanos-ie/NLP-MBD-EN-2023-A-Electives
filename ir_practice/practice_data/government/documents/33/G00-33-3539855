                                        Attention


         Our system detects that you are not using an NIH computer.

   If you are a researcher/research staff or other person receiving funds
   through NIH grants or contacts you will be directed to a CBT that is
   designed specifically for NIH grantees.

       Before you begin the CBT, please write down this email address:
         support@cine-med.com. Contact this address if you have problems
            with this CBT (i.e., unable to print your certificate of
         completion, etc.). The Office of Human Research Subjects cannot
                       help you with this training module.
       Click HERE to start the training module for extramural researchers,
          "Human Participant Protections Education for Research Teams."

                              NIH access only:

   If you are a researcher, research staff or other person employed by the
   NIH or otherwise required to take the CBT on protecting human subjects
   designed for the NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP), you must use an
            NIH computer to fulfill this educational requirement.
