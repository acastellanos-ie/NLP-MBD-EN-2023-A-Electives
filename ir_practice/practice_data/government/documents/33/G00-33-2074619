                               Robert Deering
                 Support Manager for Airspace and Procedures

     On July 1, 2001, Robert Deering retired after 31 years with the
     FAA.  Robert was the support manager for Airspace and Procedures
     since August 1991.  Frank Pecere, Support Manager for Quality
     Assurance, will be acting Support Manager for Airspace and
     Procedures until a new Support Manager can be selected.  Bob's
     expertise will be missed in the airspace arena.  We wish him well in
     his retirement!

   Welcome to the Airspace and Procedures portion of our web site. We have
   oversight responsibility of the procedures and associated airspace that
   make up the National Airspace System (NAS). In addition we continually
   evaluate system requirements and validate that the equipment,
   navigational aids, and automation meet these requirements. We also
   provide cartographic services for the facility.  It is our goal to
   provide the best airspace system possible for all users.
