   The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and Clinical Trials
   Monitoring Branch (CTMB) has established two special electronic mailing
   lists: the CTEPTECH ListServ and the CTMBTECH ListServ.

   The CTEPTECH ListServ provides subscribers with technical information
   on technical issues related to the CTEP and its surrounding information
   systems.

   The CTMBTECH ListServ facilitates technical discussions regarding the
   redesign of the current CTMB Audit Database System (CTMB-ADS) to a
   Web-based system. Subscribers can participate in discussions concerning
   the redesign of the CTMB-ADS by sending and receiving E-mailed messages
   to and from the CTMB and other Cooperative Groups.
