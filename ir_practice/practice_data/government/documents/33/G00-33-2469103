   [3foto8-sm.gif] Russia's War in Afghanistan - Photography, paintings
   and psywar materials from the 1979-1989 Afghanistan war.
   [RU-Army-film2-SM.jpg] Russian MOD seeks to bolster image.  "The 1990s
   have been difficult for both the army and culture, but now it has
   become clear that we need each other," Culture Minister Mikhail
   Shvydkoi said Thursday at ceremony where he signed a cooperation
   agreement with the Defense Ministry.
   [tsar-tsarina-sm.gif] Russia's Last Tsar - A series of articles from
   the St. Petersburg Times about Nicholas II and Russia's royal family,
   the Romanovs.
   [couple-sm.jpg] "Mail Order brides" - Dozens of companies offer their
   services to American men seeking to meet women from Ukraine, Russia and
   other parts of the Former Soviet Union.  The US Embassy Kiev has posted
   a cautionary note about the internet "love trap."  Some of these
   relationships end tragically -- a man in Washington state is accused of
   murdering his "mail order bride."
   [jam_in-sm.JPG] Vladivostok's Big Snow - Russia's metropolis of the Far
   East has its biggest snowfall in 50 years.
   [shkidchenko-sm.jpg] Shkidchenko's trip to Brussels It is an open
   secret that Minister of Defense Volodymyr  Shkidchenko projected a far
   better image in the West than did his predecessor. Little wonder, for
   the new Ukrainian minister spoke in English, which is still rare for
   the former USSR. Moreover, he cited concrete facts rather than mouthing
   hackneyed phrases about the progress of military reform. (Dehn)

   US Cuts Aid to Ukraine A compromise foreign-aid budget passed on Dec.
   20 includes a whopping 12 percent cut in funds earmarked for Ukraine.
   The appropriation of $154 million is significantly less than the $180
   million the U.S. Senate had wanted to spend, and more than the $125
   million proposed by the U.S. House of Representatives. (Kyiv Post)

   Census Counts 48.86 Million in Ukraine According to preliminary results
   of Ukraine's national census released Thursday, the country's
   population has decreased by 3 million since the last census, in 1989,
   to 48.86 million.

   Sukhoi Claims Banner Year Russia's leading manufacturer of fighter
   jets, Sukhoi, said Thursday that 2001 was its best year since the
   collapse of the Soviet Union and business will be even better next
   year, as new projects evolve and a reorganization of the company is
   completed.

   Russian Secret Police Archive Released Soviet history may have to be
   rewritten now that the Russian secret police headquarters has released
   the archives of Stalin's secret agents into the public domain. Russia's
   NTV said the three-volume collection of unabridged documents stored at
   the Lubyanka spy HQ contains "sensational material on abuses of power
   at the highest levels". The collection, entitled "Top secret: Lubyanka
   reports to Stalin on the situation in the country", is now under the
   scrutiny of Russian scholars.  The documents, released on December 19,
   are stamped "for Stalin's eyes only" and "destroy after reading".

   Russian Peacekeepers Unlikely in Kabul - Russia will probably not be
   among the countries that the UN Security Council picks to deploy
   peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, an exclusion that should please
   both Moscow and Kabul, experts said.

   Russian Spy Boss Welcomes New Western Cooperation - Sergei Lebedev, the
   head of Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency, in a rare interview
   published on Thursday, welcomed new cooperation with the West but
   feared it would be forgotten once the U.S.-led anti-terrorist campaign
   was over.  Lebedev was born in Soviet Uzbekistan and had intelligence
   training in Ukraine. He worked for 20 years in Germany, East and West
   and post-reunification, and in the United States before Putin appointed
   him to his current job in May 2000. (Gazeta.ru)
