                        ABOUT THE SECURITIES DIVISION

   The Securities Division was established in the early 1930s and now
   administers the Securities Act (RCW 21.20), Franchise Investment
   Protection Act (RCW 19.100), Business Opportunity Fraud Act (RCW
   19.110), and the Commodities Act (RCW 21.30).

   The Division's primary mission is to protect Washington State residents
   from dishonest or fraudulent practices by people selling investments.
   The Division accomplishes this mission through a variety of regulatory
   and enforcement tools, including registration requirements for
   securities, franchise and business opportunity offerings and licensing
   and examination of broker-dealers and investment advisers.  It also
   undertakes investigations based upon complaints.
