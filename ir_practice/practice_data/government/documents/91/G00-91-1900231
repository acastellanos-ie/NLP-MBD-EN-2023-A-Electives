   10/9/98 Sandia Livermore's Weather Tower Added to the Web Site (TOC)

     Sandia Livermore's weather tower has been incorporated into the LLNL
     Weather pages. The current conditions being reported by the Sandia
     tower are HERE. Data from this tower is also available from all of
     the other LLNL Weather tools such as reports and plots.
     __________________________________________________________________

   4/6/98 Added Report Generation for Daily Statistics(TOC)

     A new page is available which allows users to generate reports from
     the daily weather statistics. Usage is similar to that of the
     weather reports page. Users can select to report min/max/avg (or any
     combination therof) values for each selected parameter. The report
     results can be downloaded to a spreadsheet program on a PC, or
     viewed with the built-in plotting capability.

   11/5/97 Site 300 Pressure Sensor Now Working<(TOC)

     The pressure sensor at Site 300 is now operating. Good data started
     at 12:00 PDT on 20 October 1997. The pressure reading is adjusted to
     Sea Level Pressure so that comparison with other stations can be
     made directly.

     We collected 48 hours of pressure data from Site 300 and three other
     nearby stations. The following graph shows the readings from these 4
     stations. The solid line follows data from the Site 300 sensor. The
     dashed line follows data from Sandia, Livermore which is a similar
     ARAC system located in Livermore Valley. The circles mark hourly
     readings from the National Weather Service station at the Livermore
     Airport. The triangles mark hourly readings from the NWS station at
     the Stockton Airport. These NWS data can be obtained here.

   8/13/97 Yesterday's High/Low Temperatures on Current Conditions
   Page(TOC)

     The current conditions page (Current Weather) now displays the
     previous day's high and low temperatures.
     __________________________________________________________________

   8/13/97 Daily Statistics now Available for Arbitrary Dates (TOC)

     The daily statistics page (Daily Stats) can now accomodate arbitrary
     dates. When first visited, the daily stats page will display
     statistics for the day previous to the current day. Statistics for
     other dates can be generated by entering a date in the input box.
     __________________________________________________________________

   8/13/97 Bar Chart of Number of Returns per Parameter added to Daily
   Statistics (TOC)

     A bar chart has been added to the daily statistics page
     (showDailyStats.pl ) that displays the number of returns for each
     parameter. There should be 96 returns for each parameter for any
     given 24-hour period. If the parameter has 96 returns, the bar for
     the parameter will be plotted in green. If the number of returns is
     not 96, the bar will be plotted as red.
     __________________________________________________________________

   7/17/97 Improved Plots from Reports (TOC)

     The plotting capability for reports has been improved. The time axis
     is now labeled with dates at day boundaries and tick marks have been
     added to indicate 12 noon of each day. The plot key has also been
     moved to the upper left corner.
     __________________________________________________________________

   7/14/97 Absolute Humidity (TOC)

     Absolute humidity has now been added to the Current Weather page for
     the mainsite. The function for absolute humidity is

                                [ahFunc.gif]

     where

     AH is absolute humidity,
     RH is relative humidity in percent, and
     T  is temperature in degrees Celsius.

     Absolute humidity has units of grams per cubic meter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   7/8/97 Small Weather Panels (TOC)

     Small weather panels are now available for both the mainsite and
     site300. The purpose of these panels is to allow continuous
     meteorological data to be available on the desktop while taking up a
     minimum of screen space. These panels are not available from the
     top-level metdat page because they require javascript. Javascript
     has been found to cause difficulties for some browsers and it would
     be unkind to crash someone's mac before warning them. In order to
     take advantage of the automatic sizing of the weather panels, they
     should be accessed from

                              Mainsite Weather
                                     and
                              Site 300 Weather.

     The link to the weather panel for the site of interest is located
     directly below the table of meteorological data for the site.
     The weather panels can also be accessed directly by loading either
     of the URL's

                           Mainsite Weather Panel
                                     or
                           Site 300 Weather Panel.

     However, you will need to manually resize the window (which you may
     wish to do on occasion).
