       INTRODUCTION
        The California Section Collection provides materials to support
       every level of research into California History. It is an
       exhaustive collection of published materials, and includes
       extensive collections of primary materials as well. Though we do
       not have a genealogical department, we have many specialized
       publications and materials which are especially valuable for
       genealogical research regarding Californians. This is a guide to
       the most frequently used genealogical sources in the California
       Section.
       For those of you unable to visit the California Room, a list of
       private researchers is available.

   ^1This index is of the DAR's transcription of the 1852 census. The
   transcription was made because the original and the microfilm of it are
   extremely difficult to read.

   ^2There is also a book index covering Sacramento County for 1870 and
   1880.

   ^3Schedules for Agriculture, Manufactures, Products of Industry, Social
   Statistics and Mortality. The microfilm of these special schedules
   circulates to any library in the United States.

   B. California State Census Records. 1852

   This special California state census for 1852, the only census taken by
   the State of California, has been copied and indexed by the Society of
   the Daughters of the American Revolution, California Chapter. They
   placed one copy in the State Library. A microfilm copy of the DAR
   transcription is available for use in the State Library and on
   interlibrary loan. There are a series of indexes to the transcription
   organized by county or groups of counties, and they are included on the
   microfilm. NOTE: despite published information to the contrary, there
   are no special California population schedules for 1855, 1865, 1875,
   etc. A few special local censuses were done for statistical reasons,
   but they do not provide access by name, nor were they done for the
   entire State. We do not have those censuses.

   COMPILATIONS BY CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN
   REVOLUTION

   Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution Collection:
   California chapters of the DAR have donated and continue to donate
   typescript volumes of indexes and lists to the State Library which are
   specifically designed for genealogical research. With few exceptions,
   those useful for research on Californians are kept in the California
   Room. Those works focused on the genealogy and lives of people living
   outside of California are housed at the Sutro Library in San Francisco.
   However, there are some works that have mixed California and
   out-of-state information that are kept in our stacks and can be paged.

    The nature of these works is sometimes confusing because of the wide
   variety of sources and styles of organization used in producing them.
   The contents of a given volume are seldom drawn from one source of
   information. They rarely contain the full text of official records. The
   term "records" in a title often means a list or index of names found in
   and abstracted from records.

    In the following list, the leading numbers in parentheses refer to a
   shelf order number that we have assigned each volume in order to keep
   it in a special location on our shelves in the California Room. Please
   note that all of the volumes are non-circulating.

    9. INDEXES TO CALIFORNIA VITAL STATISTICS--California Death Index
   (1905-1995) and the California Bride and Groom Indexes (1949-1986).
   These volumes are brief index listings to the official certificates
   obtainable from the California Department of Health Services, Health
   Data and Statistics Branch, 304 "S" Street, Sacramento, California
   95814. The Statistics Branch will search its records for a fee. For
   reliable information on current fees, please contact them at the above
   address. Since July 1, 1905 the State has collected these records
   centrally, but they are also available in the County where the event
   took place. For events prior to July 1, 1905 they are only available in
   the Counties. We do not have indexes to State or County birth records.

   a. DEATH INDEXES: The indexes for 1905-1929, 1930-1939, as well as the
   set of individual indexes for each of the years 1950-1959, are bound,
   paper volumes, which are quite fragile. These may not be photocopied
   under any circumstances. The indexes on microfiche cover 1940 through
   1995 in ten year increments, 1940-49, 1950-59, etc., except for
   1990-1995. Does not circulate.

    b. MARRIAGE INDEXES: For the years 1949-1959 there are two volumes for
   each year, one for Brides and one for Grooms. These volumes are fragile
   and may not be photocopied under any circumstances. The years 1960-69,
   1970-79, 1980-85 and 1986 are published in microfiche, one set for
   Brides and one for Grooms. Does not circulate.
