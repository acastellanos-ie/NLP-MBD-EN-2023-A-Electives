   Primer on Electricity Electricity is a form of energy with a number of
   unique properties. It is constantly in motion and can't be stored,
   although it can be used to create other forms of energy that can be
   stored. There is an analogy between electricty flowing through wires
   and water flowing through pipes, which is helpful in clarifying
   concepts such as current and voltage. Voltage is analogous to water
   pressure -- to keep electricity flowing at the appropriate rate, the
   voltage must be maintained within certain design parameters. But a more
   physically accurate analogy is that electricity is like waves flowing
   through water flowing though pipes. In this picture, the pipes are
   still analogous to wires, but the water is like electrons in the wires,
   and electricity is a type of wave travelling through the wire that can
   transport energy from place to place. Any type of wave has a frequency
   associated with it -- this is basically the speed with which successive
   wave crests pass a given point. Electricity (or more specifically, AC
   current) as it flows has a frequency that, like voltage, has to be kept
   within certain design limits.

   Like water, electricity will flow over any path that is open to it. In
   an interconnected transmission system, this effectively means that, if
   at some point in the system someone is putting electricity in (or
   taking it out), then the flow of electricity will be affected
   everywhere. Unlike water, electricity is quite dangerous to handle. A
   live wire leaking electricity is a much greater hazard than a pipe
   leaking water. Moreover, the equipment that generates, transmits and
   uses electricity is designed to operate with specific voltages and
   frequencies. If these are not maintained, there can be substantial
   damage to equipment or transmission lines. Damage to this equipment may
   make electricity unavailable for days or even weeks.

   Generators and final consumers of electricity are connected to one
   another through an enormous web of wires, transformers and other
   equipment which we will just refer to as the grid. Given the physical
   nature of electricity, operation of the grid is a complicated task that
   requires continuous monitoring, not just of the supply of and demand
   for electricity, but also of various technical parameters such as
   voltage and frequency. Maintaining these parameters at their
   pre-established values, and being ready to compensate for any
   unexpected events such as a generator or transmission line failure, is
   the primary responsibility of the California Independent System
   Operator , or ISO. This is known as maintaining system reliability.
   Ensuring that there is actually enough electricity flowing at all times
   to meet the demand of consumers is called maintaining system adequacy.
   While this is important, it is secondary to maintaining reliability.
   Inadequate supply may lead to rolling blackouts, which are a problem,
   but they are used to avoid the more serious problems that can result
   from a failure of system reliability.

   In economic terms, electricity is a commodity that is produced,
   transported and sold. Currently, the division of labor in California is
   roughly as follows: Electricity is produced by generators that can be
   owned by just about anyone, including private companies whose primary
   business may or may not be electricity, the Municipal Utility Districts
   ( Muni 's) such as LADWP and SMUD , or the utility companies. Transport
   of electricity is the ISO's responsibility inside its own control area
   (see more on this below). The Muni's are responsible for operating the
   grid in their own service areas. These administrative units are
   physically interconnected in one big grid, which also covers the other
   Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico. Obviously, the
   electricity doesn't care who is responsible for which part of the grid,
   and to maintain the overall system reliability, different entities need
   to work closely together. For example, to avoid system failure, the ISO
   may need to ask the Muni's to accept blackouts, or it may need to call
   in emergency power supplies from out-of-state. The organization
   responsible for overseeing operation of the grid in the Western part of
   the continent is called the Western Systems Coordinating Council or
   WSCC. Final distribution of electricity to consumers, billing etc. is
   the business of the Investor Owned Utilities ( PG&E , SCE , and SDG&E )
   in their service areas, and of the Muni's in theirs. A map of the
   different municipal and commercial utility service areas is available
   here .

   In 1996 legislation was passed in California mandating the creation of
   a wholesale market for electricity. Wholesale is the term used to
   describe sales of electricity by generators, to the ISO, the Muni's,
   the in-state utility companies, or out-of-state. These intermediaries
   then distribute it to consumers, also known as retail sales. In a
   market, sellers of electricity state the price they want to receive. If
   they don't get it, they don't generate. This gives a different sense to
   the word supply, which can mean either the amount of electricity a
   generator is physically capable of producing, or the amount that the
   owner of the generation resources is willing to make available on the
   market. To distinguish between these two concepts, we will use the
   terms capacity and market supply . Califoria's current problems are not
   merely a result of insufficient capacity, they are also due to
   difficulties in maintaining adequate market supply at an affordable
   price. Our purpose in creating this site is not to editorialize on this
   situation , but to help clarify the nature of the problem, and give
   concrete definition to some of the issues.

   ISO Control Area The ISO defines a control area as a "geographic area
   which regulates its generation in order to balance load and maintain
   planned interchange schedules with other control areas" ( ISO Summer
   Assessment, p. 40). Loosely, it is a portion of the grid over which a
   single entity has responsiblity for maintaining the balance of supply
   and demand, and ensuring reliability. The ISO control area consists of
   the former control areas of the three Investor Owned Utilities (PG&E,
   SDG&E, and Southern California Edison). It includes the current service
   areas of these utilities, and the service areas of a few of the
   Municipal Utility Districts, including SMUD. The ISO Control Area does
   not include LADWP. A map of the different utility and MUD service areas
   is available here . A map of the ISO control area can be found here .
   Within it's control area, the ISO is responsible for scheduling
   generation and load, contracting for all the services necessary to
   maintain grid reliability ("ancillary services", in the technical
   jargon), and dealing with any and all contingencies. To account for all
   the power that flows through the wires, they also need to keep tabs on
   how much electricity is entering and leaving through the borders of
   their control area. The ISO web site contains extensive information on
   their technical and market operations.

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Maximum Capacity
   As outlined in the Primer above, we need to make a distinction between
   the market supply of electricity (the amount available to be sold) and
   the physical capacity of generation resources. The Maximum Capacity
   defined here corresponds to the latter concept - it represents the
   total amount of electricity that could conceivably be produced by all
   the generators in the ISO control area. Anyone who wants to operate a
   generator inside California has to obtain a license from the state
   government to do so. The California Energy Commission maintains lists
   of all the generators licensed to operate in the state (including the
   Muni's) at their Siting Information Page , under Historical and
   Statistical Data. From this list, the total on-line capacity in state
   is 53,810 MW. There are 9,130 MW in the Municipal districts, and 44,680
   MW of capacity in the ISO area. The latter figure is used on the chart.
   This is a maximum because at any given moment some generators may not
   be operating, or not operating at full capacity, for a wide variety of
   reasons.

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Forced and Planned Outages For system reliability purposes, it isn't
   enough to know if a generator is hooked up to the grid -- you also need
   to know if it's going to be operating. For this reason, every day the
   generators must notify the ISO if they plan to take capacity
   "off-line". A generator that is off-line is called an "outage" or a
   "curtailment". Outages can be scheduled in advance (usually for
   maintenance purposes), in which case they're known as "planned"
   outages. Or they may occur with little or no advance notice, in which
   case they're called "forced" outages. Each day the ISO publishes a
   detailed list of these planned and forced outages, which we use to
   compute the totals in our figure. It's important to realize that plants
   can go off-line or come on-line at any time, so these daily numbers are
   necessarily approximate. As the ISO states, "[b]ecause outages may
   overlap or may not all be simultaneously in effect, this report may
   indicate a different total outage/curtailment than a real-time report
   using only data from curtailments/outages in effect at that time." An
   archive of the ISO files containing this data is available here.

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Imports and Exports Keeping track of the electricity flowing through
   the grid entails monitoring how much enters and leaves the ISO control
   area. Electricity going out is called an "export" while electricity
   coming in is (not surprisingly) referred to as an "import". Exports and
   imports don't necessarily leave the state -- they may also be due to
   exchanges with the Municipal Utility Districts inside California. So,
   for example, if a generator inside the district controlled by LADWP
   sells power to SDG&E, this will be counted as an import to the ISO
   area. A Muni buying electricity from a generator inside the ISO area
   would count as an export. The information on our chart is taken from
   the ISO's OASIS Hour Ahead Market Information, which you will find on
   the menu here. This tells you the volume of imports and exports that
   have been scheduled about two hours in advance of the current (or
   operating) hour. The ISO also operates real-time markets, and buys
   electricity "out-of-market" in real time, so the real-time values of
   imports/exports may be somewhat different.

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Potential Capacity Our estimate of the total capacity that is
   potentially available to supply electricity is computed as the sum of
   (Maximum Capacity) minus (Forced and Planned Outages) plus (Imports)
   minus (Exports). There are uncertainties, and there may be real-time
   variations, in all the quantities that go into this calculation. Some
   of these are discussed under the other headings. The uncertainty is
   partly due to a lack of data, but is also due to the inherently dynamic
   nature of the grid. The quanitity of supply represented by "Potential
   capacity", compared with the current load, is meant to give a rough
   sense of how close we are to over-taxing the available resources, but
   can't be used as an exact measure of how much electricity is really
   available. One reason for this is that the ISO also operates real-time
   markets, but data on the volume of electricity traded in these markets
   is not available to be posted on our chart. Also, some of the power
   plants in the state are "peaker plants", which generally operate only
   during periods of peak demand, and are not available at all times.

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Current Load The current load is the total demand for electricity in
   the ISO control area at the current time. Since it's impossible to
   track changes in demand that occur every second, the current load
   really represents an average over a time period of about ten minutes.
   The ISO web site has a small chart of current and forecast load, along
   with some other information, here . Although the load varies everytime
   anyone flicks a switch, on the average it's fairly predictable, with
   variations due to daily, weekly and seasonal patterns. Load that is
   fairly constant over the entire day is referred to as the "baseload"--
   for residences, it includes such things as refrigerators, water
   heaters, and lights that are never turned off. Baseload for residential
   and commercial buildings can be surprisingly large, considering that
   there is little activity at night. Seasonal variations in load are due
   mainly to changes in the need for heating and cooling, and can be quite
   substantial. This is somewhat inconvenient in terms of managing supply,
   since generation capacity has to be built to satisfy the peak load, but
   for much of the year the actual loads may be much less.

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Forecast Load The demand for electricity is fairly predictable, given
   information about weather, the habits of individuals and businesses,
   economic activity, etc. To facilitate the operation of the grid the ISO
   produces a number of forecasts of the daily system load. Two-day-ahead
   and one-day-ahead forecasts can be found here (click on "Load"). We use
   their one-day-ahead forecast on our chart. The ISO does an adjustment
   to this forecast two hours ahead of the operating hour, and uses this
   value in the chart at their website ( here ). So, the forecast on their
   chart may differ somewhat from ours. The forecast load is an important
   quanitity because it is used to estimate reserve requirements, which
   need to be booked in advance as much as possible.

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Load plus Reserves The current load on the system is determined by what
   everyone who uses electricity is actually doing at the moment. As such,
   it fluctuates constantly. The system is designed to handle these
   fluctuations within limits, but very large fluctuations (due say to an
   unexpected generator failure) can cause major problems, including
   equipment failures that are expensive and time-consuming to fix. To
   avoid these problems, all grid operators (not just the ISO) are
   required to make sure that a certain amount of "reserve" capacity is
   available. There are different types of reserves (spinning,
   non-spinning), as well as other forms of so-called "ancillary services"
   that the ISO must acquire to be able to dynamically maintain the
   balance between supply and demand. Detailed information about the
   markets for these services are available at the ISO OASIS site here.
   The Western Systems Coordinating Council actually sets the standards
   for grid operators in the western part of the continent (they have to
   use the same standards, because all the grids are interconnected). The
   formula is somewhat complicated, but amounts to a requirement of about
   7% of the forecast load, which is the figure we use on the chart. If
   you want the gory details, you can find them here, or search the WSCC
   site for information on "Minimum Operating Reliability Criteria"
   (MORC). The ISO calls emergencies (Stage 1,2 and 3) when reserves are
   in short supply -- physics requires that supply in the grid equal
   demand in the grid, irrespective of what supply in the market is doing,
   so a potential shortfall shows up first in the reserves.
