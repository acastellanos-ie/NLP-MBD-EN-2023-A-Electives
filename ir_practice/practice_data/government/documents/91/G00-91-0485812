                              The GLOBE Program

   Thank you for visiting the Web site of the GLOBE Program, operated by
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration. Our site collects no personal
   information about you unless you choose to provide that information to
   us.

   When you use our web site, we do not record information about
   individuals or about their visits to the Web site. When you send e-mail
   through our Web site, your e-mail address and the information in your
   message are used to help us gather the information you request and to
   respond to your message.

   Our Web server computer systems automatically collect and store certain
   information to help us make our Web site perform better and be more
   useful to GLOBE teachers, students and other Web site visitors. Our
   server computer systems automatically collect and store the following
   information: the name of the part of the Internet from which you are
   connected to the Internet (for example, "XYZcompany.net" if you use a
   private Internet Service Provider account or "yourschoolsystem.edu" if
   you connect through a school system that is directly connected to the
   Internet) and the Internet (IP) address of the user's computer at that
   time, along with the type of Web browser you are using, the address of
   the Web site you may have linked through to get to our site, the Web
   pages you visit, and the date and time of these accesses. The Internet
   (IP) address is usually assigned by the Internet Service Provider for
   the duration of each session on the Internet, but it can sometimes
   identify the computer you are using to access the Internet

   If you log in as a GLOBE school, the information listed above is
   collected along with the identification of the school. All data entered
   are associated with the school in the GLOBE Student Data Archive, which
   is publicly available on the Internet. All GLOBEMail entered is
   accessible to the school or person you address it to as well as to
   anyone at your school who is able to access GLOBEMail.

   If you send us an e-mail message using our Web site, for example, one
   to info@globe.gov or help@globe.gov, we use the information you
   provide, including your e-mail address, to help us gather the
   information you request and to respond to your message. In an effort to
   respond to your request, information you submit may be viewed by some
   government employees and government contractor or grantee employees,
   such as GLOBE Principal Investigator scientists, so as to provide the
   best possible response to you. In some limited circumstances, such as
   requests from Congress or private individuals, we may be required by
   U.S. law to disclose the content of e-mail you submit.

   When you submit your name and information about your school to sign up
   for a GLOBE Teacher Training Workshop, that information is used for the
   purpose of responding to your request. The information is maintained in
   GLOBE computer systems for the purpose of assisting you and your school
   in your participation in the GLOBE Program. When you sign up for a
   GLOBE teacher training workshop sponsored by a GLOBE U.S. Partner
   rather than the GLOBE Training Office, the information you provide is
   forwarded to that U.S. Partner for the purpose of assisting you and
   your school in your participation in the GLOBE Program, including
   arranging for you to attend the GLOBE Teacher Training Workshop.

   Our Web site contains links to various other Web sites of Government
   agencies and private organizations. Once you link to another site, you
   are subject to the policies of the new site. The GLOBE Web server
   computers do not enable "cookies," which are used by many Web sites to
   store information on a user's computer that provides for continuity of
   user support over multiple sessions.

   For Web site security purposes and to ensure that this site remains
   available to all users, the government computer systems used to support
   this Web site employ software programs to monitor network traffic to
   identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or that
   otherwise might cause damage.

   If you have any questions or comments about the information presented
   here, please forward them to info@globe.gov.
