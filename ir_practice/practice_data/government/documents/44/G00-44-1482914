   QWEST COMMUNICATIONS CHAIRMAN AND CEO JOSEPH NACCHIO ASSUMES CHAIR OF
   NETWORK RELIABILITY AND INTEROPERABILITY COUNCIL
   Washington - FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell today announced that Joseph
   P. Nacchio, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Qwest
   Communications, will chair the next term of the Network Reliability and
   Interoperability Council (NRIC VI). Chairman Powell thanked Level 3

   for leading the Council during its previous term (NRIC V).

   The Council's members are senior representatives of providers and users
   of telecommunications services and products, including
   telecommunications carriers, the satellite, cable television, wireless
   and computer industries, trade associations, labor and consumer
   representatives, manufacturers, research organizations and government
   related organizations.

   The role of the Council is to develop recommendations for the
   Commission and the telecommunications industry to assure optimal
   reliability, security, interoperability and interconnectivity of, and
   accessibility to, public telecommunications networks and the Internet.
   NRIC VI will work on traditional reliability issues with a strong
   emphasis on national security.

   Mr. Nacchio is also Vice-Chairman of the National Security
   Telecommunications Advisory Committee, a Federal Advisory Committee Act
   body that advises President Bush on national security
   telecommunications matters.

   Mr. Nacchio said: "I am honored that Chairman Powell has asked me to
   serve as the Chairman of the Network Reliability and Interoperability
   Council at this crucial time and I look forward to working with him and
   the members of the Council."
