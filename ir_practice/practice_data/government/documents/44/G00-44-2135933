   Colorado River Board Homepage


   The Colorado River Board of California was established in 1937 by State
   statute to protect California's rights and interests in the resources
   provided by the Colorado River and to represent California in
   discussions and negotiations regarding the Colorado River and its
   management.

   California's rights and interests in the water and power resources of
   the Colorado River System are vital to the State's economy. Seven
   counties in Southern California, with a population of about 17 million,
   more than half of the state's population, receive water and
   hydroelectric energy from the Colorado River.
