   FAA Advises Air Travelers on Airport, Airline Security Measures

     On Oct. 8, the FAA issued the following tips to help air travelers
     meet and assist the heightened security measures implemented since
     the Sept. 11 attacks. Please note that air travelers are limited to
     one carry-on bag and one personal item on all flights .
     Allow extra time:
     * The heightened measures require more time to properly screen
       travelers. Travelers should contact their airline to find out how
       early they should arrive at the airport.
     * Take public transportation to the airport if possible. Parking and
       curbside access is likely to be controlled and limited.
     * Curbside check-in is available on an airline-by-airline basis.
       Travelers should contact their airline to see if it is in place at
       their airport.

     Check-in:
     * A government-issued ID (federal, state, or local) is required.
       Travelers may be asked to show this ID at subsequent points, such
       as at the gate, along with their boarding passes.
     * Automated check-in kiosks are available for airlines that have
       appropriate security measures in place. Travelers interested in
       this option should check with their airline.
     * E-ticket travelers should check with their airline to make sure
       they have proper documentation. Written confirmation, such as a
       letter from the airline acknowledging the reservation, may be
       required.

     Screener checkpoints:
     * Only ticketed passengers are allowed beyond the screener
       checkpoints, except for those with specific medical or parental
       needs.
     * Each traveler will be limited to one carry-on bag and one personal
       bag (i.e., purse or briefcase).
     * All electronic items, such as laptops and cell phones, may be
       subjected to additional screening. Be prepared to remove your
       laptop from its travel case so that both can be X-rayed separately.
     * Limit metal objects worn on person.
     * Travelers should remove all metal objects prior to passing through
       the metal detectors in order to facilitate the screening process.

     Items prohibited from aircraft cabins:
       The following items must be placed in, or transported as, checked
     baggage or risk confiscation.
     * Knives of any length, composition or description
     * Cutting instruments of any kind and composition, including carpet
       knives and box cutters (and spare blades), any device with a
       folding or retractable blade, ice picks, straight razors, metal
       scissors and metal nail files
     * Corkscrews
     * Baseball/softball bats
     * Golf clubs
     * Pool cues
     * Ski poles
     * Hockey sticks
     * When in doubt, transport item in checked baggage

     Permitted items:
     * Walking canes and umbrellas (once inspected to ensure prohibited
       items are not concealed)
     * Nail clippers
     * Safety razors (including disposable razors)
     * Syringes (with documented proof of medical need)
     * Tweezers
     * Eyelash curlers

     At the gate:
     * Travelers must be prepared to present a valid photo identification
       card, along with their boarding pass.
     * Travelers and their bags may be subjected to additional screening.

     At all times:
     * Control all bags and personal items.
     * Do not bring anything onboard for another person.
     * Report any unattended items in the airport or aircraft to the
       nearest airport or airline personnel.
