   [glendaowens.jpg] As Acting Director of the Office of Surface Mining, I
   would like to take this opportunity to invite you to use our internet
   information source. This one-stop information resource has
   revolutionized the distribution of information to our constituents.
   And, the site is updated daily, so it's continually providing the most
   current information we have available.

   I also invite you to provide comments and suggestions for improving the
   Office of Surface Mining operations or information available from this
   web site. If you have a question, ask it electronically and we will
   send you an e-mail answer.

   This web site has linked thousands of people to the Office of Surface
   Mining information and opened the door for them to quickly and easily
   interact with us on everything from improving the implementation of the
   Surface Mining Law to gaining instant access to important information.
   We think this is exciting, and I hope you will work with us as we grow
   along with this expanding technology.

   Glenda Owens, Deputy Director
