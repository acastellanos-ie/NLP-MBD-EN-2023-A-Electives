Math and Science Partnership (MSP) Program

   Important Dates:

   MSP Program Solicitation available on the web - week of January 28th

   Optional Letter of Intent - March 15, 2002

   Proposals due at NSF - late April 2002

   NSF is launching the new Math and Science Partnership (MSP) program
   that will make $160 million available in fiscal year 2002. The MSP is
   part of the President's initiative --No Child Left Behind -- which
   states that "...we have fallen short in meeting our goals for
   educational excellence. The academic achievement gap between rich and
   poor, Anglo and minority is not only wide, but in some cases is growing
   wider still." The MSP offers the mathematics and science education
   community an opportunity to build on its decade-long dedication to
   educational reform by increasing the capacity of preK-12 educational
   systems and institutions of higher education to provide the requisites
   for learning to high standards in science, technology, engineering and
   mathematics, while being attuned to reducing gaps in achievement among
   student populations.

   A defining feature of the MSP program will be the development and
   implementation of productive partnerships among major stakeholders with
   each partnership requiring commitments from one or more school
   districts and one or more higher education entities. Partnership also
   are encouraged to include other collaborators, such as state or tribal
   governmental agencies, science centers, museums, businesses, and
   community organizations, that bring additional assets to K-12 teaching
   and learning. In all cases, MSP collaborations will unite the efforts
   of K-12 schools with mathematics, science, and/or engineering faculty,
   as well as education faculty, from institutions of higher education.

   Through the initial Program Announcement, the MSP will offer support,
   for up to five years, for two types of partnership efforts: those that
   are comprehensive in nature and those that are more targeted in their
   focus.
