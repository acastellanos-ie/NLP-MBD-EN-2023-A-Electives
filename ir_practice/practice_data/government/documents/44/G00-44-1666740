   Conservation of Private Grazing Lands

        The nation depends on its 642 million acres of private grazing
   lands. They produce food and fiber. They provide aquifer recharge,
   streamflow, and flood protection.
       They offer wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities. To
   people in rural areas, private grazing lands are the economic
   lifeblood. And the environmental benefits that healthy private grazing
   lands provide make life better for us all.

   How Conservation of Private

   Grazing Land Will Work
       Conservation of Private Grazing Land was authorized by the
   conservation provisions of the 1996 Farm Bill. It will ensure that
   technical, educational, and related assistance is provided to those who
   own private grazing lands. This assistance will offer opportunities
   for:
       q Better grazing land management;
       q Protecting soil from erosive wind and water;
       q Using more energy-efficient ways to produce food and fiber;
       q Conserving water;
       q Providing habitat for wildlife;
       q Sustaining forage and grazing plants;
       q Using plants to sequester greenhouse gasses and increase soil
   organic matter; and
       q Using grazing lands as a source of biomass energy and raw
   materials for industrial products.

       Conservation of Private Grazing Land is administered by the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation
   Service (NRCS).

   Funding
       For Conservation of Private Grazing Lands, $10 million has been
   made available for fiscal year 1997 from conservation technical
   assistance funds.
       Legislation states that up to $60 million can be appropriated for
   technical assistance for grazing lands.

   What is the Conservation of Private
   Grazing Land authorization?
       This new authorization will ensure that technical, educational, and
   related assistance is provided to owners of private grazing lands. It
   is authorized by the conservation provisions of the 1996 Farm Bill.
   Conservation of Private Grazing Land is administered by the U.S.

   protect their soil from wind and water erosion, conserve water, provide
   habitat for wildlife, and sustain forage and grazing plants.
