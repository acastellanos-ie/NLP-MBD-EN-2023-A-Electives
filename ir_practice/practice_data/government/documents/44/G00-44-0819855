     The Office of International Affairs welcomes you. We believe that on
     this site you will learn more about what we do, how we accomplish
     our mission and where you can go for additional information. We have
     added many new things, included a massive update, and are providing
     you with what we believe to be a thorough listing of interesting
     international links.

     In addition, we have endeavored to keep our young future scientists,
     engineers, and consumers in mind while developing our new look by
     adding a Students' Page where youth will find items of interest to
     all age groups.

     We encourage you to browse this site and provide any feedback. If
     you would like to make comments on this site, please contact:
