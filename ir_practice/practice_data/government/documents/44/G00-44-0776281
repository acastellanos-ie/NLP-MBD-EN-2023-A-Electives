   NEWS FLASH -  $105 million appropriated for the Community Access
   Program in FY 2002

   Background

   Several Federal grant programs increase access to health services for
   vulnerable populations, place health care professionals in underserved
   communities, and provide support services for people with specific
   health needs.  Few resources, however, are available to help health
   care providers coordinate these "safety net" services for uninsured and
   underinsured Americans.

   Some forward-looking communities have begun to reorganize their health
   care delivery systems to provide better coordinated, more efficient
   care for uninsured residents.  These models of service integration
   have:
     * created networks to share uncompensated care more fairly among
       local health providers;
     * linked hospital and clinic services through state-of-the-art data
       systems that share information and create seamless transitions for
       uninsured patients; and
     * funded managed care networks for the indigent through local tax
       increases.

   CAP builds on these existing models of service integration to help
   health care providers develop integrated, community-wide systems that
   serve the uninsured and underinsured.  CAP grants are designed to
   increase access to health care by eliminating fragmented service
   delivery, improving efficiencies among safety net providers, and by
   encouraging greater private sector involvement.  Many CAP models
   provide for integration of substance abuse and mental health treatment
   into the primary care model and have as collaborative members social
   and human services organizations as well as the faith community.  A
   majority of CAP grants fund the development and implementation of
   disease and case management protocols.  Promotores or  community health
   workers play a key role in health promotion, outreach, enrollment, and
   case management.  Underscoring all CAP efforts is the vision and
   reality of providing "better health for more people for less cost."
   System efficiencies are supported and enhanced with improvements to
   Management Information Systems while disease and case management
   methods serve to reduce inappropriate and costly utilization of
   Emergency Rooms and redirect patient care into more appropriate
   settings.  Creative financing, insurance products and next generation
   MIS are just samplings of the diverse and complex CAP projects.

   Currently, CAP grants support 136 communities in urban and rural areas
   and on tribal lands.

   FY 2000 Grants

   Congress provided $25 million for the Community Access Program in FY
   2000.  In September 2000, HRSA used this investment to fund 23
   communities and consortia of health care providers:
     * Communities were selected based on need; progress toward developing
       an integrated delivery system; the appropriateness and quality of
       services to be provided; potential for sustainability; and sound
       management, budget and evaluation plans.
     * Partners in the CAP coalitions include local health departments,
       public hospitals, community health centers, universities and state
       governments.  Each partner brings a variety of investments and
       range of expertise to the local efforts.
     * The partners use CAP funds to create and expand collaboration in
       three main areas Â– coordinated intake and enrollment systems,
       integrated management information systems, and referral networks
       and coordination of services.  The range of strategies grantees
       take in building their systems reflect different local needs and
       resources.

   The first year of the CAP grant process provides clear evidence of
   local interest in improving health care access.  HRSA had more than
   2,300 requests for application kits for the 23 grants and eventually
   received 207 full applications from 44 states, the District of Columbia
   and Puerto Rico.

FY 2001 Grants

   In FY 2001, Congress provided $125 million for the Community Access
   Program.  With this appropriation HRSA supported several aspects of the
   program, including the following.
     * Fifty-three communities, whose applications had been approved but
       not funded in FY 2000, received awards in March 2001.
     * Sixty communities representing new applicants received awards in
       September 2001.
     * Each of the original 23 communities received supplemental funds in
       an amount approximately 75% of their first year award. Prior to
       receiving supplemental funds, each community was required to
       document satisfactory progress toward meeting the objectives
       outlined in their original application and provide a proposal
       outlining how supplemental funds would be utilized.
     * Training and technical assistance was provided for all 136 CAP
       grantees.
     *  The  foundation for the national evaluation was developed.

   FY 2002 Grants

   There was bi-partisan agreement in the Labor/HHS Appropriations
   Conference Committee to fund the Community Access Program at $105
   million. The $105 million is part of a $120 million Community Access
   Program line item that includes $15 million for the State Planning
   Grant program. HRSA leadership will be making decisions on whether
   funds will be available for new grants and what the future of the
   program will look like. Please check back within the next few months
   for additional information.
