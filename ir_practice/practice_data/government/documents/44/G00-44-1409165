   Center Goal, Objective, and Elements

   Goal: The NASA MSFC shall provide quality language assistance to LEP
   persons, as appropriate, in its respective programs and activities. The
   LAP shall be defined to include MSFC programs that are local, regional,
   and national.

   Objective 1: The NASA MSFC shall develop a LAP for LEP persons.

   Element 1. Assessment: Needs and Capacity
   NASA MSFC shall have in place mechanisms to assess, on an ongoing
   basis, the LEP status and language assistance needs of their target
   audience(s) in their respective conducted programs and activities, as
   well as mechanisms to assess their capacity to meet those needs
   according to the elements of this plan.
   __________________________________________________________________

   1.1.1 - Define a reporting system (examples: a quarterly request for
   input; a form to be completed for each request received, etc.) that
   will provide assistance in defining a metric for assessing success.
   Based on the information received, make modifications as needed in the
   LAP.

   Responsibility - EO Officer for overall assessment; various employees
   (particularly, Media and Community Relations, Education Office,
   Webmaster, and CIO) to ensure that reporting occurs.

   Target Date: September 30, 2001
   __________________________________________________________________

   1.1.2 - Present the LAP to the Director and Senior Staff, and after
   their approval, utilize various media (Newsletter, Daily Planet, EO Web
   site, etc.) to notify MSFC employees of the purpose and mechanics of
   the LAP. Ensure that those who have responsibility for executing the
   LAP are clearly defined and notified so they will understand their
   accountability.

   Responsibility - Center Director and EO Officer

   Target Date: September 30, 2001
   __________________________________________________________________

   1.1.3 - Advertise the LAP to our customers outside of MSFC, especially
   in communities with LEP persons. Post a statement on the EO Office Home
   Page and utilize handouts, news releases, and other outlets so our
   customers are aware of the LAP. Advertisements for specific events will
   also have a statement concerning the availability of assistance for LEP
   persons, if applicable.

   Responsibility - EO Officer, working with other responsible
   organizations.

   Target Date: Calendar year 2002

   Once informed, it will be the responsibility of the individual
   organizations to locate, utilize, and report on the resources that have
   been identified.

   persons in the target audience(s) of the respective conducted programs
   and activities. These written materials may include, but not be limited
   to, paper and electronic documents such as program and/or activity
   announcements, notices, web sites, and correspondence.
   __________________________________________________________________

   1.3.1- Define the LEP target audiences for the local, regional, and
   national conducted programs and activities. Identify written materials
   to be translated. Consider level of material, appropriateness for
   translation, and impact on furthering NASA's mission. Utilize past
   history, input from members of Speakers Bureau, and other MSFC
   employees, as well as input from the local community.

   Responsibility -EO Officer to meet with the appropriate organization to
   identify materials for translation. EO Officer to also identify
   potential funding sources for translation and printing costs. Metrics
   will also be established to ensure that materials translated are used.
