    Information Collected and How it is Used

    If you do nothing during your visit to Access Washington but browse or
    download information, we automatically collect and store the following
    information about your visit:
    1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used but not the
       email address. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical
       identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or
       directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to
       direct Internet traffic to you;
    2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
    3. The date and time you visited this site;
    4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and
    5. The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site.

   The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve
   the content of our web services and to help us understand how people
   are using our services. Access Washington analyzes our web site logs to
   continually improve the value of the materials available on our site.
   Our web site logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no
   attempt to link them with the individuals that browse Access
   Washington.

   If during your visit to Access Washington you participate in a survey
   or send an email, the following additional information will be
   collected:
    1. The email address and contents of the email; and
    2. Information volunteered in response to a survey.

   The information collected is not limited to text characters and may
   include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us. The
   information is retained in accordance with Chapter 40.14 RCW,
   Preservation and Destruction of Public Records.

   We use your email to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to
   you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our web site,
   or to forward the email to another agency for appropriate action.
   Survey information is used for the purpose designated.
       _______________________________________________________________

    Personal Information and Choice

   "Personal information" is information about a natural person that is
   readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information
   includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone
   number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered
   personal information.

   We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily
   participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e. sending an
   email or participating in a survey). If you choose not to participate
   in these activities, your choice will in no way effect your ability to
   use any other feature of Access Washington.

   If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by
   the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.
   However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and
   may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
   federal or state law.

   Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information
   requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by email will be
   treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject
   to public access.
       _______________________________________________________________

    Public Disclosure

   In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is
   open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and
   information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are
   exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve
   various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are
   provided by both state and federal laws.

   All information collected at this site becomes public records that may
   be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption
   in law exists. RCW 42.17. 260(1) states that

   Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available
       for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the
       record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of
       this section [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other
       statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific
       information or records. To the extent required to prevent an
       unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by
       RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying
       details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315
       when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in
       each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained
       fully in writing.

   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public
   Records Act or other law governing the disclosure of records, the
   Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.
       _______________________________________________________________

    Access and Correction of Personal Information

   You can review any personal information we collect about you. You may
   recommend changes to your personal information you believe in error by
   submitting a written request that credibly shows the error. If you
   believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose
   other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact us. In all
   cases, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before
   granting access or making corrections. See Contact Information section.
