   Help for the SIS Questionnaire
     __________________________________________________________________

   This SIS Questionnaire is made up of the following pages:
   1. Main Page
   2. Investigator Page
   3. Partner Page
   4. Client Page
   5. Location of Project Page
   6. Product Page
   7. Review Page
   8. Help Page (this page)

   SIS Information

   1. The starting point for starting this questionnaire is at URL:
   http://sis.cr.usgs.gov/sis. Save this location as a bookmark and always
   start this SIS Questionnaire from this location.

   2. Always finish filling in all applicable boxes on a page before
   clicking on the SUBMIT button and continuing on to the next page.

   3. To save your entries always click on the SUBMIT button when you have
   finished entering information for that page. Clicking on SUBMIT saves
   your entries to a file.

   4. Five categories - Investigator, Partner, Client, Location of
   Project, and Product - loop back to themselves to allow you to enter
   multiple records. That is, every time you click on SUBMIT, you are
   brought back to a new blank page for that category. When you have
   finished entering information for a category (and all boxes are blank),
   click on CONTINUE ON to go to the next SIS category.

   For example, when you fill in all applicable boxes for the Investigator
   Page and then click on the SUBMIT button, you have saved all of the
   information entered on that page. You are then brought back to and
   presented with a clean Investigator Page, with all of the boxes blank
   so that you can enter the next record. This process may be continued
   for as many records (pages) you need. When you have finished entering
   Investigator information (and all boxes are blank on the Investigator
   page), click on CONTINUE ON to go to the next SIS category - in this
   case, the Partner Page.

   5. The Review Page displays all the previous information you have
   entered on the SIS pages: Main, Investigator, Partner, Client, Location
   of Project, and Product. You may modify your entries on the Review Page
   before clicking on FINAL SUBMIT.

   6. The button FINAL SUBMIT saves all the information contained on the
   Review Page and returns you to the beginning of the SIS Questionnaire
   to allow you to enter new SIS information. After clicking on FINAL
   SUBMIT, all of your entries will be forwarded on for review and to be
   incorporated into the SIS Database. Only by clicking on FINAL SUBMIT
   will your entries be permanently saved and forwarded on to the SIS
   Database.

   7. On the Review Page, you may erase any of the fields by simply back
   spacing within that field prior to clicking on FINAL SUBMIT. To remove
   entire records for Investigators, Partners, Clients, Location of
   Projects, and Products, simply blank out all fields for that particular
   record by back spacing within those fields of that record.

   8. The entries on some of the pages require validation. If an entry is
   incorrect, a red check mark will appear next to that entry. Leave
   non-mandatory fields blank if they are not applicable to you. All
   mandatory fields must be filled in.
   Fields that are validated are:
       Project Status (mandatory)
       Project Start Date (mandatory)
       Project End Date (mandatory)
       Facility Contact: Phone, Fax, Email, and State
       Project Contact: Phone, Fax, Email, and State
       Progress/Results Date
       BRD Prior Years Funding (mandatory)
       BRD Current Fiscal Year Funding (mandatory)
       BRD Anticipated Total (mandatory)
       Investigators: State, Phone, and Email
       Partners: Phone
       Partners: Prior Years Funding
       Partners: Current Year Funding
       Partners: Anticipated Total
       Client: Date of Request
       Client: Scope of Request
       Products: Status
       Products: Status: Date

   9. Please do not use either the Back or Forward buttons while executing
   this questionnaire. Use only the buttons SUBMIT, CONTINUE ON, RESET, GO
   TO, START OVER and FINAL SUBMIT within the questionnaire pages. The
   reason you shouldn't be using the Back or Forward buttons is that your
   cache is not being saved for each page and the entry information on
   that page is being retrieved from files rather than cache.

   10. Use of the navigation buttons is entirely optional. They are
   primarily intended for use from the Review Page, to allow you to return
   to SIS pages that requre additional information. For example, if you
   determine from the Review Page that you have entered only three
   Investigator records where there should be four, you can go to the
   Investigator Page by clicking on GO TO. After you add the missing
   Investigator record, you can return to the Review Page from the
   Investigator Page by clicking on GO TO.

   11. Files are created from the information that you enter on the SIS
   questionnaire. Your IP number (remote address) is used to derive unique
   file names for these files. Your IP number may or may not remain the
   same for everytime that you use your particular browser. For some
   browsers, the IP numbers remain constant and for others they don't. To
   verify whether your IP number remains constant or not, first write down
   your personal IP number: 128.173.49.57 (this is your IP number). Now
   exit your browser and then restart it and return to this help page. If
   the IP number remains the same then you can return to the SIS
   questionnaire again and again, and your unfinished files will still be
   saved on the system. In other words, you can enter your information to
   the SIS questionnaire over many separate sessions and your unfinished
   files will remain on the system. All finished files (after FINAL
   SUBMIT) are saved and forwarded on to the SIS Database. These files
   will NOT be immediately incorporated into the SIS Database, but will be
   reviewed prior to their incorporation.

   12. DO NOT PRINT THE WEB PAGE PRIOR TO SUBMITTING!
