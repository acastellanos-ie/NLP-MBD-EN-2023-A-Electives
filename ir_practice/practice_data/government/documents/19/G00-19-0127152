                                 Delia L. Johnson
                                    Director

   Welcome to the IBB Office of Civil Rights (OCR) website.  As Director
   of OCR, I am responsible for directing the development of proactive
   strategies aimed at increasing representation of women, minorities, and
   persons with disabilities in IBB's workforce.  Included in these
   responsibilities are directing the development of the IBB's Multi-Year
   Affirmative Employment Program (AEP), advising the IBB Director and
   Agency managers on the current state of EEO and AEP activities,
   overseeing the planning and implementation of IBB's Federal Financial
   Assistance Program, ensuring that persons with EEO and AEP
   responsibilities are adequately trained, developing programs to ensure
   all agency employees are aware of their EEO rights and IBB's EEO
   objectives, and issuing Final Agency Decisions (called FADS in EEO
   parlance) on complaints of discrimination.  All of these programs are
   designed to insure IBB's compliance with all federal Equal Employment
   Opportunity (EEO) statutes and regulations.

   The OCR staff includes EEO Specialists who process complaints and
   conduct EEO counseling for IBB employees.  Supporting these OCR
   Specialists is a pool of volunteer Collateral EEO Counselors from IBB
   who have been trained by OCR to handle Complaints at the informal stage
   in order to reach resolution between the parties involved.  For formal
   complaints, OCR has experienced contractors who conduct investigations
   that help to provide the background upon which final Complaint
   decisions are made.

   In addition to Complaints, OCR administers an assortment of outreach
   programs which include Mentoring, Partners in Education, Affirmative
   Employment, Special Emphasis, Diversity Training, and Federal Women's
   programs.  Through the implementation of these programs, it is our goal
   to assist IBB managers and employees in maintaining harmonious and fair
   working conditions.  On the website you will find links to EEO
   legislation, articles on EEO, and explanations of OCR programs.  If you
   have questions or comments on the contents of this website, please
   forward them by email to: djohnso@ibb.gov.

   I look forward to hearing from you.
