   IEEE 802.16 Working Group on Broadband Wireless Access Standards

  Welcome!

   The National Wireless Electronic Systems Testbed (N-WEST) is a project
   of two agencies of the United States Department of Commerce: the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National
   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

   N-WEST is a measurements and standards resource for the broadband
   wireless access industry. N-WEST's mission is to promote the
   development of the industry by creating and carrying out tests and
   measurements at the system and component levels and by promoting sound
   operational standards and specifications based on open technical
   results. N-WEST invites the participation of service providers, system
   integrators, and component manufacturers. The standardization effort is
   underway through the IEEE 802.16 Working Group on Broadband Wireless
   Access of the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee.

   Please scan through the table of contents. Don't miss the list of over
   80 Supporting Companies.

   N-WEST welcomes your participation in order to help build the BWA
   industry. Please let us know if you are interested in participating and
   how we can meet your needs. If you'd like to keep up with the progress
   at N-WEST, subscribe to our electronic mailing list. We've also set up
   an easy way to tell a colleague about N-WEST.
