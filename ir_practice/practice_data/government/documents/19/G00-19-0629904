   Payload:

             Space Station Assembly Flight ISS-09-6A (Raffaello MPLM-1,
             Racks/SLP, Canadarm2(SSRMS,SPDM), LCA,RU, UHF Antenna)

   Mission Objectives:

             Click here for Additional Info on STS-100

             The highest priority objectives of the flight are the
             installation,
             activation and checkout of the robotic arm on the station. The
             operation of the arm is critical to the capability to continue
             assembly of the International Space Station and to attach a new
             airlock to the station on the subsequent shuttle flight, mission
             STS-104, planned for launch in June. A final component of the
             Canadian Arm is the Mobile Base System (MBS) that will be
             installed
             onboard the station during the UF-2 STS-111 flight.

             Other major objectives for Endeavour's mission are to berth the
             Raffaello logistics module to the station, activate it, transfer
             cargo between Raffaello and the station, and reberth Raffaello
             in the
             shuttle's payload bay. Raffaello is the second of three Italian
             Space
             Agency-developed multi-purpose logistics modules to be launched
             to
             the station. The Leonardo module was launched and returned on
             the
             last shuttle flight, STS-102, in March.

             Remaining objectives include the transfer of other equipment to
             the
             station such as an Ultra-High Frequency communications antenna
             and a
             spare electronics component to be attached to the exterior
             during
             space walks. Finally, the transfer of supplies and water for use
             aboard the station, the transfer of experiments and experiment
             racks
             to the complex, and the transfer of items for return to Earth
             from
             the station to the shuttle are among the objectives.

             Endeavour also is planned to boost the station's altitude and
             perform
             a flyaround survey of the complex, including recording views of
             the
             station with an IMAX cargo bay camera.

   Launch:

             April 19, 2001 2:41 p.m. EDT. Launch occured ontime at the
             opening of a 4.5 minute launch window. SSME cutoff ontime at T+8
             minutes 39 seconds. Shuttle liftoff weight 4,521,931 lbs.

             On Tuesday, April 17, 2001, engineers completed troubleshooting
             a faulty lighting dimmer switch on the flight deck of the crew
             module. The electrical box was successfully replaced overnight
             following cryogenic loading. Loading of the orbiter's onboard
             cryogenic storage tanks is now complete, and technicians are
             working no further problems at the pad at this time. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 4/18/2001)
             On Monday, April 16, 2001, the launch countdown for mission
             STS-100 began at 6 p.m. as scheduled. Preparation continues
             toward a launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour and the seven-member
             flight crew at 2:41 p.m. Thursday. The orbiter's onboard
             cryogenic storage tanks were then loaded for flight and the
             orbiter midbody umbilical unit demated. Loading operations began
             about one hour late, allowing engineers to troubleshoot a
             lighting dimmer switch in the crew module before clearing the
             pad. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 4/17/2001)

             Space Shuttle Endeavour rolled out of the Vehicle Assembly
             Building today at about 9:50 a.m. Solid rocket booster closeout
             inspections slightly delayed first motion, and Endeavour is now
             expected to arrive at the pad before 4 p.m. Once at the pad,
             routine launch pad validations commence, verifying all vehicle
             and facility interfaces. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             3/22/2001)

             Shuttle orbiter Endeavour departed OPF bay 2 Saturday at about
             9:26
             a.m. headed for the VAB. Orbiter and external tank mating
             activities
             are under way and the Shuttle Interface Test will conclude on
             Wednesday. The full Space Shuttle stack is scheduled to roll out
             of
             VAB high bay 3 at 7 a.m. on Thursday, March 22, and should
             arrive at
             Launch Pad 39B by about 1 p.m.
