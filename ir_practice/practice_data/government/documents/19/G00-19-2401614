   The TRansportation ANalysis SIMulation System (TRANSIMS) is a set of
   new transportation and air quality analysis and forecasting procedures
   developed to meet the Clean Air Act, the Intermodal Surface
   Transportation Efficiency Act, Transportation Equity Act for the 21st
   Century, and other regulations.  It consists of mutually supporting
   simulations, models, and databases that employ advanced computational
   and analytical techniques to create an integrated regional
   transportation system analysis environment.  By applying advanced
   technologies and methods, it simulates the dynamic details that
   contribute to the complexity inherent in today's and tomorrow's
   transportation issues.  The integrated results from the detailed
   simulations will support transportation planners, engineers, decision
   makers, and others who must address environmental pollution, energy
   consumption, traffic congestion, land use planning, traffic safety,
   intelligent vehicle efficiencies, and the transportation infrastructure
   effect on the quality of life, productivity, and economy.
