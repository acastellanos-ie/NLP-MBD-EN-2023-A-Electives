     __________________________________________________________________


   Domestic Partnerships are registered with the Secretary of State's
   Office as provided by Division 2.5 of the Family Code, commencing with
   Section 297.

   A Domestic Partnership is established when persons meeting the criteria
   specified by Section 297 of the Family Code file a Declaration of
   Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State's Office. After the
   form is filed, a copy of the form will be mailed to the common
   residence address provided.

   The Domestic Partnership can be terminated, as provided by Section 299
   of the Family Code, by filing a Termination of Domestic Partnership
   with the Secretary of State's Office.

   The Declaration of Domestic Partnership Form (DP-1) and the Termination
   of Domestic Partnership Form (DP-2) are available in PDF file format
   and can be viewed, filled in and printed from your computer using
   Adobe's Acrobat Reader 4.0 (how to get the free Acrobat Reader). Once
   completed, the documents should submitted to the Secretary of State's
   Office at the address provided on the form.
