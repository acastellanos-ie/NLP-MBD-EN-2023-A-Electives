zTool

   Use zTool to examine a bathymetry data set. You can display a
   cross-section profile, and compute volume above and below the section.
   Using the polygon tool you can compute the volume of an outlined
   polygon at various tide levels.

PLEASE NOTE: zTool has been tested using Netscape rev 4.7 for UNIX and
Windows, and Netscape 6.2 for MacOS and Windows. Your browser must have
JavaScript enabled.

Data Sets:


                      Full Bay
                   100m grid
                   (1950-95 data) San Pablo Bay
                                  50m grid
                                  (1983 data)  Suisun Bay
                                               25m grid
                                               (1990 data)

To compute a cross-section area and
plot the profile:

     * Select a data set from the list above
     * Select the tide level in the Bathy data box
     * If necessary use the scroll bars at the bottom and right of the
       image to locate your area of interest
     * Select the line tool
     * Locate the start of your profile with a single mouse click
     * Move to mouse to the end of your profile and terminate the profile
       with a second mouse click (use the RESET button to relocate your
       profile)
     * Click on the SUBMIT button to obtain your results

To compute volume of a polygon:

     * Select a data set from the list above
     * Select the tide level in the Bathy data box
     * If necessary, use the scroll bars at the bottom and right of the
       image to locate your area of interest
     * Select polygon tool and outline your polygon using the mouse; click
       at each vertex of the polygon; use the spacebar to end the outline
       selection
     * Use the Establish Seed button to set a start point for the volume
       calculation; after selecting Establish Seed, click anywhere within
       your polygon
     * Click on the SUBMIT button to obtain your results

Example Output Screen from Polygon Tool:

   Using the POLYGON TOOL you can compute the volume of a portion of the
   Bay. In the example below, Suisun Bay has been outlined in the
   "Selection Window"; in the "Results Window", an image of the selected
   area and the volume of that segment is returned.
