         Public Utilities is a multi- disciplinary team within the General
         Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Energy Center of
         Expertise. Our mission is to provide leadership within the Federal
         Government with regard to developing contracting vehicles that enable
         our customers to procure utility services at the lowest cost to the
         taxpayer and the greatest value to American citizens. Our services
         cover the procurement of electricity, natural gas, water, and sewage
         services. Current emphasis is on the positioning of the Government to
         take advantage of potential cost savings which may be possible upon the
         restructuring of the electric industry initiatives which are currently
         underway at the State and Federal level.

         Our customers are all Federal agencies (Executive, Legislative,
         Judicial and quasi-Government) requiring public utility services and
         the public utility industry providing these services.

         Stakeholders include Federal, State, and regional regulatory bodies and
         the general rate-paying public.

         Take a moment and look around. We hope your visit is helpful and thanks
         for stopping by.
