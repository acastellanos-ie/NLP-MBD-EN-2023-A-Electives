                                About MOSTARS
               (Missouri Student Assistance Resource Services)
     __________________________________________________________________

   MOSTARS, the student assistance division of the Missouri Department of
   Higher Education, provides free resources, assistance, and customer
   service for students, parents, postsecondary institutions, high
   schools, lenders, secondary student loan markets, legislators, and
   government agencies to help students access postsecondary education in
   Missouri.

   Early Awareness and Outreach Efforts
   MOSTARS provides early college awareness and financial assistance
   information to students and their families. Through the Gaining Early
   Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) project,
   specific activities such as tutoring, mentoring, and financial aid
   seminars ensure that low-income students and their families have the
   information they need to prepare academically and financially for
   postsecondary education.

   Student Financial Assistance Programs
   MOSTARS administers federal and state student financial assistance
   programs that provide approximately $394 million to 120,000 students
   annually.

   Default Prevention and Debt Management Initiatives
   MOSTARS' default prevention and debt management initiatives are to
   designed to:
     * Increase awareness of financing options for postsecondary education
     * Reduce student loan indebtedness
     * Increase awareness of the responsibilities and consequences of
       student loan borrowing and default
     * Reduce consumer debt among postsecondary students

   Customer Services
   MOSTARS provides quality customer service to all of our constituents.
   Major services currently provided include:
     * Automated Transfer of Money (ATOM): Serving as an escrow agent, the
       Missouri Student Loan Program (MSLP) streamlines the delivery of
       Federal Family Education Loan Program funds to institutions for
       students and their parents.
     * Electronic Transmissions: Institutions are able to transmit state
       grant and scholarship program data and funding electronically.
       Institutions and lenders also are capable of processing student
       loans through Comprehensive Loan Information Processing System
       (e*CLIPS) software and receiving loan data electronically through
       the ATOM process. MOSTARS also provides electronic entrance and
       exit loan counseling through Mapping Your Future, a nationally
       sponsored web site to which institutions can link.
     * Compliance Services: Compliance staff provide technical assistance
       to lenders and institutions by interpreting regulations and
       conducting program reviews to determine whether they are in
       compliance with state and federal student assistance program
       requirements.
     * Information Center: Approximately 800 phone calls from parents,
       students, schools, lenders, and others are received weekly through
       the nationwide toll-free phone number. As services expand to reach
       a new constituency, including high school counselors and other
       individuals interested in access to postsecondary education, more
       information about planning for higher education, both financially
       and academically, will become available.
     * Client Services: Client service representatives visit approximately
       350 institutions and lenders annually to help them administer
       student assistance programs efficiently and effectively. To aid in
       disseminating information about new programs and services and to
       promote access to postsecondary education, client service
       representatives participate in high school nights and statewide
       conferences and work with other state and federal associations.
     * Publications: Brochures, newsletters, training materials, and
       manuals are distributed annually to students, parents,
       postsecondary institutions, high schools, lenders, and government
       officials to aid in their pursuit of postsecondary education and to
       help financial aid administrators with their daily administrative
       responsibilities.
