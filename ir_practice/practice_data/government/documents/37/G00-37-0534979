   Publications Header image

   Organizations in all sectors of the economy depend upon information
   systems and communications networks, and share common requirements to
   protect sensitive information. ITL works with industry and government
   to establish secure information technology systems for protecting the
   integrity, confidentiality, reliability, and availability of
   information.

   Under the Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235), the Computer
   Security Division of the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)
   develops computer security prototypes, tests, standards, and procedures
   to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or
   modification. Focus areas include cryptographic technology and
   applications, advanced authentication, public key infrastructure,
   internetworking security, criteria and assurance, and security
   management and support.

   These publications present the results of NIST studies, investigations,
   and research on information technology security issues.

   The publications are issued as Special Publications (Spec. Pubs.),
   NISTIRs (Internal Reports), and ITL (formerly CSL) Bulletins. Special
   Publications series include the Spec. Pub. 500 series (Information
   Technology) and the Spec. Pub. 800 series (Computer Security). Computer
   security-related Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are
   also included.

       List of common searches [All_____] Click here to Search
     * Drafts
       This page consists of draft NIST Publications (FIPS, Special
       Publications) that are either open for public review and to offer
       comments, or the document is waiting to be approved as a final
       document by the Secretary of Commerce.
     * ITL Bulletins
       ITL Bulletins are published by NIST's Information Technology
       Laboratory, with most bulletins written by the Computer Security
       Division. These bulletins are published on the average of six times
       a year. Each bulletin presents an in-depth discussion of a single
       topic of significant interest to the information systems community.
       Not all of ITL Bulletins that are published relate to computer /
       network security. Only the computer security ITL Bulletins are
       found here. There is a link provided on this page to get
       non-computer security ITL Bulletins.
     * Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS)
       FIPS publications are issued by NIST after approval by the
       Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 5131 of the Information
       Technology Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106, and the Computer
       Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235).
     * Special Publications
       Special Publications in the 800 series present documents of general
       interest to the computer security community. The Special
       Publication 800 series was established in 1990 to provide a
       separate identity for information technology security publications.
       This Special Publication 800 series reports on ITL's research,
       guidance, and outreach efforts in computer security, and its
       collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic
       organizations.
     * Interagency Reports
       NIST Internal Reports (NISTIRs) describe research of a technical
       nature of interest to a specialized audience.
       The series includes interim or final reports on work performed by
       NIST for outside sponsors (both government and nongovernment).
       NISTIRs may also report results of NIST projects of transitory or
       limited interest, including those that will be published
       subsequently in more comprehensive form.
     * NIST Publication List 91 & How to order NIST Publications
       Publication List 91 link - This is a complete list of NIST Computer
       Security Publications: NISTIR's, Special Publications, FIPS PUBS,
       ITL Bulletins.
       Order link - If CSRC does not have an electronic copy of the
       document you are looking for, this would be the page to go to get
       the information you need to order a copy.
     * Other NIST Computer Security Division Publications, Documents, and
       Papers
       This page lists publications, papers or documents that the staff of
       the Computer Security Division has written and are not classified
       in the publication categories listed above.
     * History of Computer Security Project: Early Papers
       This list of papers was initially distributed on CD-ROM at NISSC
       '98. These papers are unpublished, seminal works in computer
       security. They are papers every serious student of computer
       security should read. They are not easy to find. The goal of this
       collection is to make them widely available. This list was compiled
       by the Computer Security Laboratory of the Computer Science
       Department at the University of California, Davis.
     * Other Security Publications
       This is a collection of computer security publications that the
       Computer Security Division received from various sources.
     * Rainbow Series
       The rainbow series is a library of about 37 documents that address
       specific areas of computer security. Each of the documents is a
       different color, which is how they became to be refereed to as the
       Rainbow Series. The primary document of the set is the Trusted
       Computer System Evaluation Criteria (5200.28-STD, Orange Book),
       dated December 26, 1985. This document defines the seven different
       levels of trust that a product can achieve under the Trusted
       Product Evaluation Program (TPEP) within NSA. Some of the titles
       include, Password Management, Audit, Discretionary Access Control,
       Trusted Network Interpretation, Configuration Management,
       Identification and Authentication, Object Reuse and Covert
       Channels. A new International criteria for system and product
       evaluation called the International Common Criteria (ICCC) has been
       developed for product evaluations. The TCSEC has been largely
       superceded by the International Common Criteria, but is still used
       for products that require a higher level of assurance in specific
       operational environments. Most of the rainbow series documents are
       available on-line.
