   This table shows each mission location along with the objective,
   aircraft used, completion date, and includes links to the individual
   missions data.

                   Chemical Instrument Test and Evaluation

   Our understanding of tropospheric chemistry is limited primarily by our
   ability to accurately measure minute quantities of key tropospheric
   species. An initial, and continuing, focus of the GTE has been the
   development, testing, and evaluation of techniques capable of airborne
   measurements of trace species. The CITE-1 mission, consisting of a
   ground- based intercomparison, and two separate airborne campaigns to
   evaluate instrumentation for measuring carbon monoxide, nitric oxide,
   and the hydroxyl radical . The CITE- 2 mission focused on
   intercomparison of techniques for measuring nitrogen dioxide, nitric
   acid , and peroxyacetylnitrate, as well as a reevaluation of nitric
   oxide techniques. The CITE-3 mission focused on intercomparison of
   techniques to measure sulfur dioxide, dimethylsulfide, hydrogen
   sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide.

   Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiments

   Nowhere is atmosphere-biosphere interactions more pronounced that
   within the atmospheric boundary layer-the lowest few hundred meters on
   the atmosphere. The ABLE missions have been designed to study emissions
   of gases from the biosphere, and the chemical changes that occur as
   these gases are transported through the boundary layer and into the
   free troposphere. Expeditions have now been completed in three
   ecosystems that are known to exert a major influence over global
   tropospheric chemistry and that are being profoundly affected by
   natural and human activities. These are ABLE-1 in the tropical Atlantic
   ocean; ABLE-2 in the Amazon Rain Forest; and ABLE-3 in the
   wetland/tundra of the North American Continent.

   Pacific Exploratory Missions

   Along the north western rim of the Pacific are the most populated
   countries of the world. The potential for these countries to emerge as
   major industrial centers, with the concurrent pollution is just
   beginning to be recognized. The PEM's were initiated to provide an
   early assessment of the chemistry over the Pacific ocean, and to study
   the impact of emissions from Asia on the Pacific region. The PEM-West
   expedition, focussed on the north western pacific region, conducted
   phase-A during a period of minimum outflow from Asia, while phase-B was
   conducted during enhanced outflow. The PEM-Tropics has focussed on the
   south tropical Pacific Basin, most of which is remote from continental
   regions.

   Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry in the Atlantic
   Transport amd Chemical Evolution over the Pacific

   TRACE-A was deployed in August 1992 to determine the cause and source
   of high concentrations of ozone that accumulate over the Atlantic ocean
   between southern Africa and South America during the months of August
   through October. The enhanced levels of ozone were observed to be the
   highest during the southern hemisphere's springtime, a period of
   intense burning of vegetation in both southern Africa and South
   America. The TRACE-A results showed the link between the biomass
   burning and the ozone pollution. TRACE-P, conducted in March/April
   2001, had as it's major objectives to 1) determine the chemical
   composition of the Asian outflow over the western Pacific in spring in
   order to understand and quantify the export of chemically and
   radiatively important gases and aerosols, and their precursors, from
   the Asian continent and to 2) determine the chemical evolution of the
   Asian outflow over the western Pacific in spring and to understand the
   ensemble of processes that control the evolution.
