   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
   Introduction
       The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) announces that proposals are
   being accepted for participation in the Fiscal Year 2002 Emerging
   Markets Program (EMP). The purpose of the EMP is to assist U.S.
   organizations, public and private, to improve market access and to
   develop and promote U.S. agricultural products and/or processes in
   low-to middle income countries that offer promise of emerging market
   opportunities. This is to be accomplished by providing, or paying the
   costs of, approved technical assistance activities in those emerging
   markets. The EMP is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service
   (FAS).
       The Act defines an emerging market as any country that the
   Secretary of Agriculture determines:
       (1) Is taking steps toward a market-oriented economy through the
   food, agriculture, or rural business sectors of the economy of the
   country; and
       (2) Has the potential to provide a viable and significant market
   for United States agricultural commodities or products of United States
   agricultural commodities.
       Because funds are limited and the range of potential emerging
   market countries is worldwide, proposals for technical assistance
   activities (``proposals'') will be considered which target those
   countries with: (1) Per capita income less than $9,265 (the ceiling on
   upper middle income economies as determined by the World Bank (World
   Development Indicators 2001)); and (2) population greater than 1
   million. Proposals may address suitable regional groupings, e.g., the
   islands of the Caribbean Basin.
   Authority
       The EMP is authorized by Section 1542(d)(1)(D) of the Food,
   Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, as amended (the Act).
   Up to $10 million is available to fund the program.
   Eligible Applicants, Commodities, and Activities
       Any United States agricultural or agribusiness organization,
   university, or state department of agriculture is eligible to
   participate in the EMP. Proposals from research and consulting
   organizations will be considered if they provide evidence of
   substantial participation by the U.S. industry. U.S. market development
   cooperators may seek funding to address priority, market specific
   issues and to undertake activities not suitable for funding under other
   FAS marketing programs, e.g. the Foreign Market Development Cooperator
   Program and the Market Access Program.
       All agricultural products, except tobacco, are eligible for
   consideration. Proposals which include multiple commodities are also
   eligible.
       Only technical assistance activities are eligible for
   reimbursement. Following are examples of the types of activities that
   may be funded:
       --Projects designed specifically to improve market access in
   emerging foreign markets. Examples: activities intended to mitigate the
   impact of sudden political events or economic and currency crises in
   order to maintain U.S. market share; responses to time-sensitive market
   opportunities;
       --Marketing and distribution of value-added products, including new
   products or uses. Examples: food service development; market research
   on potential for consumer-ready foods or new uses of a product;
       --Studies of food distribution channels in emerging markets,
   including infrastructural impediments to U.S. exports; such studies
   should be specific in their focus and may include cross-commodity
   activities which focus on problems, e.g., distribution, which affect
   more than one industry. Examples: grain storage handling and inventory
   systems development; distribution infrastructure development;
       --Projects that specifically address various constraints to U.S.
   exports, including sanitary and phytosanitary issues and other
   non-tariff barriers. Examples: seminars on U.S. food safety standards
   and regulations; assessing and addressing pest and disease problems
   that inhibit U.S. product exports;
       --Assessments and follow up activities designed to improve
   country-wide food and business systems, to reduce trade barriers, to
   increase prospects for U.S. trade and investment in emerging markets,
   and to determine the potential use for general export credit guarantees
   for commodities, facilities and services. Examples: product needs
   assessments and market analysis; assessments for using facilities
   credits to address infrastructural impediments;
       --Projects that help foreign governments collect and use market
   information and develop free trade policies that benefit American
   exporters as well as the target country or countries. Examples:
   agricultural statistical analysis; development of market information
   systems; policy analysis;
       --Short-term training in broad aspects of agriculture and
   agribusiness trade that will benefit U.S. exporters, including seminars
   and training at trade shows designed to expand the potential for U.S.
   agricultural exports by focusing on the trading system. Examples:
   retail training; marketing seminars; transportation seminars; training
   keyed to opening new or expanding existing markets.
       The Program funds technical assistance activities on a
   project-by-project basis. EMP funds may not be used to support normal
   operating costs of individual organizations, nor as a source by which
   to recover
   prior expenses from previous or ongoing projects. Ineligible activities
   include restaurant promotions; branded product promotions (including
   labeling and supplementing normal company sales activities intended to
   increase awareness and stimulate sales of branded products);
   advertising; administrative and operational expenses for trade shows;
   and the preparation and printing of brochures, flyers, posters, etc.,
   except in connection with specific technical assistance activities such
   as training seminars. Other items excluded from funding are contained
   in the FY 2002 EMP Guidelines.
   Project Suitability and Qualification Requirements
       The underlying premise of the EMP is that there are distinctive
   characteristics of emerging agricultural markets that necessitate or
   benefit significantly from U.S. governmental assistance before the
   private sector moves to develop these markets through normal corporate
   or trade promotional activities. The emphasis is on marketing
   opportunities where there are risks that the private sector would not
   normally undertake alone. The EMP is intended to supplement, not
   supplant, the efforts of the U.S. private sector and it complements the
   efforts of other FAS marketing programs. Once a market access issue has
   been addressed by the EMP, further market development activities may be
   considered under other programs such as GSM-102 or GSM-103 credit
   guarantee programs, the Facility Guarantee Program, the Supplier
   Guarantee Program, the Market Access Program, or the Cooperator
   Program. Section 108 funds may be used to complement funding provided
   by the EMP.
       The following marketing criteria will be used to determine the
   suitability of projects for funding under the EMP:
       1. Low U.S. market share and significant market potential.
       Is there a significant lag in U.S. market share of a specific
   commodity in a given country or countries?
       Is there an identifiable obstacle or competitive disadvantage
   facing U.S. exporters (e.g., competitor financing, subsidy, competitor
   market development activity) or a systemic obstacle to imports of U.S.
   products (e.g., inadequate distribution, infrastructure impediments,
   insufficient information, lack of financing
   options or resources)?
       What is the potential of a project to generate a significant
   increase in U.S. agricultural exports in the near-to medium-term?
   (Estimates or projections of trade benefits to commodity exports, and
   the basis for evaluating such, must be included in EMP proposals.)
       2. Recent change in a market.
       Is there, for example, a change in a sanitary or phytosanitary
   trade barrier; a change in an import regime or the lifting of a trade
   embargo; or a shift in the political or financial situation in a
   country?
   Application Requirements and Process
       It is highly recommended that any organization considering applying
   to the Program for FY 2002 first obtain a copy of the 2002 Program
   Guidelines. These Guidelines contain information on requirements that a
   proposal must include in order to be considered for funding under the
   Program.
       Requests for the 2002 EMP Guidelines and additional information may
   be obtained from the Marketing Operations Staff at the address above.
   The Guidelines are also available at the following URL address:
   http://www.fas.usda.gov/mos/em-markets/em-markets.html.
       To assist FAS in making determinations regarding funding,
   applications should be no longer than ten (10) pages and include the
   following information: (a) Name of organization submitting the
   proposal; (b) Federal tax ID number of submitting organization; (c)
   date of proposal; (d) address, telephone and fax numbers of the
   organization; (e) full title of proposal; (f) constraint description
   activities (statement of problem to be addressed); (g) objectives and
   detailed description of project approach and specific; (h) benefits to
   U.S. agricultural exports as a result of the project, including
   specific performance measures; (i) target country/countries for
   proposed activities; (j) supporting market analysis of the target
   market(s)--brief economic analysis for each commodity and country,
   including current market conditions and relevant trade data--and
   existing size of U.S. export market share, in dollars and/or
   quantities, and the basis or source(s) for this data; (k) information
   on whether similar activities are or have previously been funded in
   target country/countries (e.g., under FAS's MAP and/or FMD programs);
   (l) a clearly stated explanation as to why participating
   organization(s) are unlikely to carry out activities without Federal
   financial assistance; (m) projected starting date (should be after 15
   July 2002) and time line(s) for project implementation; (n) detailed,
   line item project budget, including other sources of funding and
   contributions from participating organizations (additional requirements
   are contained in the 2002 Program Guidelines) and any third party
   contributions. Qualifications of applicant(s) should be included, but
   as an attachment.
       This notice is complemented by concurrent notices announcing other
   foreign market development programs administered by FAS including the
   Market Access Program (MAP), the Foreign Market Development Cooperator
   (Cooperator) Program, the Section 108 Program, and the Quality Samples
   Program (QSP). For FY 2002, EMP applicants have the opportunity to
   utilize the Unified Export Strategy (UES) application process, an
   online system which provides a means for interested applicants to
   submit a consolidated and strategically coordinated single proposal
   that incorporates funding requests for any or all of these programs.
   Applicants are not required to use the UES, but are strongly encouraged
   to do so because it reduces paperwork and expedites the FAS processing
   and review cycle.
       Applicants planning to use the on-line system must contact the
   Marketing Operations Staff at (202) 720-4327 to obtain site access
   information. A login ID and password will be supplied to a prospective
   applicant upon request. A ``Help'' file will be available to assist
   applicants with the process. However, the on-line application for the
   EMP will not be available until approximately late January. Therefore,
   all organizations applying for funding assistance in FY 2002 are urged
   to begin preparing their applications in accordance with the
   requirements contained herein and the FY 2002 Program Guidelines, and
   provide this information once the online application is available. A
   notice concerning the availability of the online system will be posted
   on the FAS web site. A printed version of the proposal should also be
   submitted (using WordPerfect, Word or compatible format) to one of the
   following addresses:
       Hand Delivery (including FedEx, DHL, UPS, etc.): Marketing
   Operations Staff, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of
   Agriculture, Room 4932-South,1400 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington,
   DC 20250-1042.
       U.S. Postal Delivery: Marketing Operations Staff, Foreign
   Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, STOP 1042, 1400
   Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250-1042.
   Allocation of Funds
       In general, all qualified proposals received before the application
   deadline will compete for EMP funding. The limited funds and the range
   of emerging markets worldwide in which the funds may be used preclude
   CCC from approving large budgets for individual projects. While there
   is no minimum or maximum amount set for EMP-funded projects, most are
   funded at a level of less than $500,000 and for a duration of one year
   or less. Multi-year proposals may be considered in the context of a
   strategic detailed plan of implementation. Funding in such cases is
   normally provided one year at a time, with commitments beyond the first
   year subject to interim evaluations.
       In general, priority consideration will be given to proposals that
   identify and seek to address specific problems or constraints in rural
   business systems or food and agribusiness systems in emerging markets
   through technical assistance activities to expand or maintain U.S.
   agricultural exports. Priority will also be given to those proposals
   that include the willingness of the applicant to commit its own funds,
   or those of the U.S. industry, to seek export opportunities in an
   emerging market. The percentage of private funding proposed for a
   project will therefore be a critical factor in determining which
   proposals are funded under the EMP. Proposals will also be judged on
   their ability to provide benefits to the organization receiving EMP
   funds and to the broader industry which that organization represents.
   Reporting Requirements
       A performance report detailing the results of each project
   supported with EMP funds must be submitted to the Marketing Operations
   Staff at the address above. Because public funds are used to support
   EMP projects, these reports will be made available to the public.
   Complete final financial reports are to accompany performance reports.
   Closing Date for Applications
       The deadline for all applications to the EMP is 5:00 p.m. Eastern
   Standard Time, March 11, 2002. Announcements of funding decisions for
   the EMP are anticipated sometime after mid-July 2002.
       Signed at Washington, DC on December 31, 2001.

   Acting Administrator, Foreign Agricultural Service, and Vice
   President,
