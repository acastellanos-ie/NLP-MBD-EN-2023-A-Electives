Who We Are and What We Do
     __________________________________________________________________

   FEMCI Is The Finite Element Modeling Continuous Improvement group was
   originally established as a mechanism for structural analysts to
   exchange information on finite elment analysis (FEA) techniques, to
   provide a resource for peer review of analysis efforts, and to act as a
   system for FEA knowledge capture for the group. While the overall goals
   of FEMCI have not changed, the scope has been broadened. Although FEA
   is still a primary concern, FEMCI seeks to encompass all the analytical
   techniques necessary for a complete and accurate structural analysis of
   spacecraft and spacecraft components. The analysts involved in FEMCI
   need access to and familiarization with a wide variety of analytical
   tools and techniques ranging from computer intensive dynamics and
   kinematic analyses to detailed hand stress analysis. FEMCI attempts to
   provide a focal point for discussion and distribution of structural
   analysis knowledge and experience.

   FEMCI approaches this goal through three avenues: First, monthly
   meetings; second, a listserver; and third, the FEMCI web site and The
   Book.

   FEMCI meetings are held monthly and are open to all GSFC civil servants
   and contractors. At these meetings special topics are presented and
   analysis problems discussed. Meetings are run by FEMCI members, and
   presentation are generally given by members as well.

   FEMCI also sponsors an e-mail listserver on the internet, the FEMCI
   Users Mailing List. The list is open to all civil service mechanical
   analysts or engineers at Goddard or any NASA center, one of our
   contractors, or to any mechanical analyst on a NASA Goddard-sponsored
   project. It is meant to provide a more immediate flow of information
   for questions and answers to analytical problems and issues.

   The FEMCI web site houses meeting minutes and presentations as well as
   a number of instructional web pages known as The Book. The FEMCI book
   is an online FEM and structural analysis resource geared toward the
   needs of group members. Specific analysis topics and techniques are
   described in detail in these pages. The web site and all it's
   information are available to anyone on the internet. Pages are
   periodically added to the book, usually in conjunction with
   presentations given at FEMCI meetings. These web pages act as an
   archive of the information collected from FEMCI members.

   FEMCI is a dynamic tool, meant to grow with the needs of its community.
   It acts as a central location for knowledge capture of FEA and other
   analytical techniques and attempts to encourage the distribution of
   that information with the overall goal of improving the accuracy and
   efficiency of structural analysis at GSFC.
