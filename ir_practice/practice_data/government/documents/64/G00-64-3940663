   About Us
   Home Page




   The Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation Program was born in 1971 out
   of the critical need to better manage growing demands for off-highway
   recreation, while at the same time foster respect for private property
   rights and protect California's natural and cultural resources. Today,
   this program, a division of the California Department of Parks and
   Recreation, is the largest and most successful program of its type in
   the U.S. Today, the program continues its commitment to provide safe,
   enjoyable recreation while balancing the need to protect the state's
   resources.

   In addition to providing accessibility to off-highway recreation for
   everyone Image California State Parks Seal from hikers to bikers to
   bird watchers, the program provides a variety of services and benefits
   to California's residents and the state's visitors, including resource
   management of its lands, wildlife habitat protection, youth development
   and law enforcement.

   Program funding comes from fuel taxes that are attributable to the
   recreational use of vehicles off highway, off-highway vehicle
   registration fees and fees collected at state vehicular recreation
   areas.

   OHV History
   The Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation Program was created in 1971 by
   the State Legislature and is operated by the California State Park
   System. The program is primarily financed through vehicle
   registrations, user fees, and that portion of the gas tax that is used
   during off-road recreation.
