   This is a snapshot of the Majorana design process. Fine-grain
   details(e.g. crystal mounting, cable handling, etc) are not shown.
   Several concept revisions have been made since these renders were
   created, but the overall idea is the same.

   1. Single cryostat, 21 crystals, cover removed.

   2. Single wide unit, 2 21 crystal cryostats included with movable
   shield
