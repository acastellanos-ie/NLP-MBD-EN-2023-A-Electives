      The surface of the sun is in constant motion due to the presence of
      several velocity components. These components include: rotation,
      cellular convection, oscillations, and meridional flow. The largest
      velocity signal is that due to solar rotation with an equatorial
      velocity of 2000 m/s. Both the oscillations and the convective motions
      have amplitudes of about 300 m/s. The meridional flow is the weakest at
      only about 20 m/s. Each of these components plays an important role in
      helping us understand the sun and how it produces its 11-year cycle of
      solar activity.

      Solar velocity data is available from the Global Oscillation Network
      Group (GONG) instruments and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on the
      SOHO Mission. Both of these investigations determine the flow
      velocities by measuring the Doppler shift of a spectral line formed by
      nickel atoms in the cooler layers of the solar atmosphere.

      The GONG data presently consists of 256 by 256 pixel intensity images
      at three different spectral positions within the line. These three
      images are processed to produce three primary data images . The sum of
      these raw images gives an intensity image which shows sunspots and limb
      darkening. The size of the change in intensity at the three spectral
      positions gives a modulation image that shows roughly where magnetic
      fields are located. The shift in the position of the spectral line with
      respect to its laboratory position gives a velocity image which is
      dominated by solar rotation and the cellular pattern of solar
      convection called supergranulation. GONG also produces magnetograms,
      images of the sun's magnetic field.

      The primary purpose of these GONG velocity images is to provide data
      for analyzing the oscillations of the sun. For studies of the nearly
      steady flows the oscillatory signal represents a source of noise and
      needs to be removed from the data. This is done by taking a weighted
      average of 17 velocity images taken at 1-minute intervals to produce an
      image of the nearly steady flows.

      These time averaged images are then processed by an image analysis
      program (121 kb GIF image) that separates the signal into its various
      components: (64 kb GIF image) Differential Rotation (142 kb GIF image)
      - the rotation signal that includes a rapidly rotating equator and
      slowly rotating polar regions; Meridional Flow (82 kb GIF image) - a
      flow directed from the equator towards the poles; Convective Blue Shift
      (267 kb GIF image) - a velocity artifact due to the correlation of
      bright convective elements with rising motions; and the
      Supergranulation (26 kb GIF image) convection pattern.

      The SOHO/MDI data consists of 1024 by 1024 pixel intensity images at
      four different spectral positions within the spectral line. This higher
      resolution data provides excellent information on the cellular flows.
      Using the same image analysis program to separate the flow components
      provides a much clearer image of the supergranulation convection
      pattern. This instrument also has a high-resolution mode with 3X
      magnification. This higher magnification reveals even finer details of
      the sun's convective flow elements.
