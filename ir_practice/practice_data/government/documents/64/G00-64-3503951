   Power Plant Security

   Although U.S. nuclear power plants are not specifically designed to be
   impervious to impact by a modern commercial jet airliner, the
   containment buildings at U. S. nuclear power plants are among the most
   massively constructed structures ever built ... (more)

   Video Formats Updated and Optimized
   Several video clips have been re-digitized and are available for
   downloading in several new formats. The video clips have been converted
   to the Video-CD MPEG-1 and RealMedia G2 formats at different
   resolutions to provide you with the best possible compromise between
   downloading performance and video quality. For selected users, these
   videos may also be distributed on CDROM.

       The entire Material Properties Section of the database has been
     redesigned and reviewed for discrepancies. Graphical materials have
       been updated, transfer times shortened, and revised versions of
   material property lookup tables and table generators have been created.

   A chapter for the description of Joint Projects between the US INSC and
    the RINSAC has been added to the web site. The current Joint Projects
       are listed, and related materials will be added as they become
                                 available.

                             Updated Design Data
      The detailed design data for all nuclear power reactors has been
      updated and greatly enhanced. The proprietary materials are only
   accessible to the DOE and it's partners and can be found when querying
   the database for individual reactors or searching for reactors by using
                             the worldwide maps.
