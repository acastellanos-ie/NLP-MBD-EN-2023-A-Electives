  ALEXIS Current Status

   Recent Dual Ported Ram failures have resulted in data only available
   from telescope pairs #1 & #2 and from the Blackbeard experiment. Data
   quality in the telescopes has been degrading as solar maximum is
   approached. Telescope operations will be scaled back over the winter
   holiday break (Dec 24-Jan3) and will resume after the Y2K event has
   past.
