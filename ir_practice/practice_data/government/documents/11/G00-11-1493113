                             About the Institute

   The Los Alamos Computer Science Institute (LACSI) conducts research in
       computer science issues relevant to the Department of Energy's
   Accelerated Strategic Computing Iniative (ASC) program.  The Institute
       conducts research over a longer time frame than the operational
    requirements of the program, yet still focuses on issues that affect
             the successful implementation of ASC's objectives.

                   LACSI was established with these goals:
     * To expand the computer science research program at Los Alamos to a
       level comparable to that of its physics program.
     * To achieve a level of prestige within the computer science
       community that is on par with that of top academic computer science
       departments.
     * To pursue computer science research relevant to the goals of the
       ASC program.
     * To ensure that ASC remains a strong focus in the academic computer
       science community.
