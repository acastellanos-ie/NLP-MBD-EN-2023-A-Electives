      The IHS Primary Care Provider is a monthly publication of the Indian
      Health Service (IHS) Clinical Support Center. It is distributed to
      approximately 8000 health care providers working for IHS, urban Indian,
      and tribal health programs; in addition, it is sent to medical,
      nursing, and pharmacy schools throughout the country.

      The goal of The Provider (as it is commonly referred to) is
      communication. It targets health care professionals including, among
      others, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, and dietitians. The
      editors welcome articles, letters, commentaries, and editorials that
      would be of interest to all those who provide health care to American
      Indians and Alaska Natives.
