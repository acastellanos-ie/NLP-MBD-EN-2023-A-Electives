   Print button image When printing an Adobe Acrobat PDF file that is
   displaying in your Internet browser you must use the print button at
   the top of the viewing window -- see arrow in the picture to the left.
   You CANNOT use the regular browser print command to print these PDF
   files.
   Print setting image If some of the characters don't print or you get
   incorrect characters — especially when printing to a laser printer —
   select a setting in the printer driver that will print the file as an
   image or as bitmap fonts. How this is done will vary from printer to
   printer. The picture at the left shows how it looks in one driver.
