                   What is the National Marine Sanctuary?

   In 1972, in response to a growing awareness of the value of our coastal
   waters, Congress passed the Marine Protection, Research, and
   Sanctuaries Act. The act authorized the designation of National Marine
   Sanctuaries to protect significant waters and secure habitat for
   aquatic species, shelter historically significant shipwrecks and other
   cultural resources, and serve as valuable spots for research, fishing,
   wildlife viewing, boating, and tourism.

   As many have stated, Marine Sanctuaries are like national parks in our
   oceans, coastal waters, and the Great Lakes.
   Fact: Twelve Sanctuaries exist today, ranging in size from 1 to more
   than 5,000 square miles.

               What is the National Marine Sanctuary Program?

   The Sanctuary program is administered by the Sanctuaries and Reserves
   Division in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   within the Department of Commerce.
   Most of the Sanctuary operations are directed by the individual
   Sanctuary managers and staff, in collaboration with the community and
   other federal, state, and local government agencies. With four
   Sanctuaries, California has more than any other state.

                          Sanctuary Program Mission

   The mission of the National Marine Sanctuaries Program is to manage
   marine areas of special significance in order to protect their
   ecological and cultural integrity for current and future generations.
   The Sanctuaries develop and implement stewardship, education and
   research programs that foster understanding, support and participation,
   and promote the ecologically sustainable use of the nation's natural
   and cultural marine resources.
