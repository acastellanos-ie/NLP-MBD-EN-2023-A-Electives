  Fathers Matter!
  Strategies for Engaging Fathers in Children's Learning

   The Departments of Health and Human Servies and Education have been
   working together to provide to provide ideas, strategies, and tools for
   teachers, school principals, child care providers, and others to
   successfully involve fathers in children's learning, including
   readiness to learn at school, at home, and in the community. Available
   from this collaboration are several products:
     * Fathers Matter!, a live, interactive national teleconference for
       educators and family service providers, hosted by the Secretaries
       of Education and Health and Human Services was broadcast on October
       28, 1999 . Fathers Matter! offered strategies for making schools
       more welcoming to parents, developing family-friendly policies at
       work, encouraging support for fathers' roles in education, and
       providing professional development for those who work with children
       and families. Discussion guide, list of panel members, and
       background information. Although not available on-line, you can
       order the video from the Department of Education's ED Pubs On-Line
       Ordering System.
     * A Call to Commitment: Fathers' Involvement in Children's Learning.
       There is overwhelming evidence that a parent's involvement in a
       child's education makes a very positive difference. In the past,
       often an unstated assumption was made that "parent involvement"
       meant "mothers' involvement." New research shows that the
       involvement of both mother and father is important.
     * Fathers' Involvement Tool Kit, this CD-ROM contains publications,
       information, video clip, and tips. Available as a free copy (while
       supplies last). Call 1-877-4ED-PUBS to request "Fathers'
       Involvement in Children's Learning" CD-ROM Tool Kit. Specify
       product number EK0334C. Also available on the Department of
       Education's ED Pubs On-Line Ordering System.
     * Involving Non-Resident Fathers in Children's Learning
       This report focuses on involving non-resident fathers in their
       children's learning. Additional efforts may be needed to help
       fathers who do not live with their children to realize that their
       contributions do matter and to engage them in their children's
       lives. This publication provides ideas, tips, examples, and
       resources for getting non-resident fathers involved in their
       children's learning, and readiness to learn at school, at home, and
       in the community.

  Hispanic

     * Hispanic Fathers and Family Literacy: Strengthening Acheivement in
       Hispanic Communities. 2000.
       In January 2000, HHS convened a meeting of community based programs
       serving Hispanic fathers and families, leaders in the fatherhood
       advocacy community, literacy program providers and federal staff to
       have a dialogue about Hispanic fathers and their role in promoting
       children's learning. This report provides a summary of that meeting
       and contains supplementary information to help organizations
       develop programs and services for Hispanic fathers and their
       families. Printed copies of the report are not yet available. [You
       may download the word processing and other files to print the
       report yourself as a "zipped" file (320K).]

  Head Start

     * The Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project has launched
       research relating to the role low-income fathers play in the lives
       of their infants and toddlers, in their families, and in the Early
       Head Start programs in which they participate. The father research
       is being conducted within an overall study of Early Head Start
       impacts and program implementation. The Early Head Start Father
       Studies are among the first to investigate involvement of
       low-income fathers in children's lives, together with mother
       involvement, in the context of both an intervention program for
       infants and toddlers and a longitudinal study. The Early Head Start
       Father Studies focus on biological fathers as well as father
       figures (sometimes referred to as "social fathers"). The EHS
       Fathers Studies Project is funded by the Administration for
       Children and Families, the National Institute for Child Health and
       Human Development, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for
       Planning and Evaluation, and the Ford Foundation.

     * Getting Off The Ground:  Implementation Findings about Child
       Support Enforcement, Head Start, and Child Care Collaboration
       Demonstrations. 1999
       This report provides early findings on the implementation of state
       inititiated collaboration demonstrations among child support, Head
       Start, and child care programs. The collaboration sites were in
       Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, and Minnesota. The three
       broad goals of the collaboration were to enhance understanding and
       trust among program staff, to increase access to child support
       services, and to increase understanding about the importance of
       fathers' non-financial contribution to children's lives. In
       addition to the findings, the report contains examples of the
       outreach and educational materials developed by the projects.
