   Committee on House Administration
   U.S. House of Representatives Seal The Committee on House
       Administration was created by the Legislative Reorganization Act of
       1946. The Act merged the Committees on Enrolled Bills (created 1789
       as Joint Committee), Elections (created 1794), Accounts (created in
       1803), Printing (created 1846), Disposition of Executive Papers
       (created 1889), Memorials (created 1929), and some functions of the
       Joint Committee on the Library (created 1806 as a Joint Committee)
       into one standing committee, the Committee on House Administration.
       In 1975 jurisdiction was added to include oversight of parking
       facilities and campaign contributions to House candidates.
       In 1995 jurisdiction added to include oversight of the Commission
       on Congressional Mailing Standards, better known as the Franking
       Commission.



   Committee on Rules

     A procedural committee known as the Committee on Rules has
     jurisdiction over "the rules and joint rules... and order of
     business of the House," and authority "to report at any time" on
     such matters (House Rules X, clause 1[q], and XI, clauses 4[a] and
     [b]).

     In Congresses of the late twentieth century, the Rules Committee
     consisted of thirteen members, nine from the majority party, four
     from the minority party. This heavy majority party ratio of 2 to 1
     plus 1 reflected the committee's status since the mid 1970s as an
     "arm of the leadership" and "legislative gatekeeper." The committee
     of the 1990s served principally to assist the majority leadership in
     scheduling bills for floor action. Bills were scheduled by means of
     special rules that gave them priority status for consideration in
     the House and established procedures for their debate and amendment.

     During its first century, however, the Rules Committee exercised a
     quite different and more limited role -- that of recommending
     changes in the standing rules for the House. At other times it has
     acted independently of House leadership. The evolution and changing
     roles of the Rules Committee in many respects mirror the historical
     development of the House itself and the changing relationships among
     its leaders, members committees and parties.

     Technology and the House Subcommittee

     Under the Committee rules, as amended for the 107th Congress, the
     Technology and the House Subcommittee will have general
     responsibility for measures or matters related to the impact of
     technology on the process and procedures of the House, relations
     between the two Houses of Congress, relations between the Congress
     and the Judiciary, and internal operations of the House.

     This subcommittee has the primary responsibility for the continued
     examination of the committee structure and jurisdictional issues of
     all House Committees.

     In the past, the subcommittee has considered measures dealing with
     "fast track" procedures for consideration of trade legislation,
     prohibitions on unfunded mandates, the recodification of the rules
     of the House and issues relating to a 21st century Congress.
