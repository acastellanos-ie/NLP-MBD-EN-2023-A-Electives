  What is OAS?

   OAS reports to the Office of the Associate Commissioner for Planning
   and Policy Development. OAS conducts audits of schools, BOCES, grant
   recipients, not-for-profit organizations and other entities located
   throughout the State that are regulated by the Department and receive
   funds administered by the Department. Such audits provide reasonable
   assurance that organizations receive their appropriate share of funds.
   They also provide reasonable assurance that funds are being used
   effectively in compliance with Department regulations and policies, and
   that adequate management controls are present. OAS also conducts audits
   of internal Department operations. In some instances, internal audits
   may crosscut processes that involve external organizations.

   OAS provides periodic reports to the Regents Subcommittee on Audits,
   which is composed of selected members of the Board of Regents. Members
   receive a briefing on the results of audit findings and
   recommendations. The Subcommittee, in turn, may provide information or
   make recommendations for action to the Board of Regents and other
   Regents committees, as well as to the Commissioner. OASs strategic
   goal and performance are geared toward the Board of Regents goal
   statement five which states:

   "Resources under our care will be used or maintained in the public
   interest."
