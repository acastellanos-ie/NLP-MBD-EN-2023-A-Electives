   Plain Language Regulations Project

Purpose

   The Plain Language Regulations Project was created to reorganize and
   rewrite the VA regulations contained in Part 3 of title 38, Code of
   Federal Regulations.   Those are the regulations that VBA uses to
   decide claims for disability and death benefits.

Public Involvement

   This Project has the ultimate goal of making government more
   responsive, accessible and understandable to the public.   This website
   is an attempt to let the public become more closely and directly
   involved in VBA's rulemaking procedures.

Comments

   Anyone who wants to comment on one of the proposed rules listed on this
   website may do so as long as we receive the comment before the comment
   period closes.   Each proposed rule document contains the date on which
   the comment period closes and a blue hyperlink which anyone can use to
   send comments about the rule.   Or, you may, instead, choose to send
   your comments to us by mail or fax.   The appropriate address and fax
   number are contained in each proposed rulemaking document.   We urge
   everyone who wants to make a meaningful comment about one of our
   proposed rules to do so.
