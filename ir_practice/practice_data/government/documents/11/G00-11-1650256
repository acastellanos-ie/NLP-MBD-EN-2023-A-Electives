                        ANL Reactor Engineering Division

  Nuclear Technologies Research and Development Expertise

   From its beginning the Reactor Engineering Division as part of the
   Engineering Research program has focused on research and development in
   support of nuclear technology. The Division's current activities
   continue to support that technology, particularly its use in the
   generation of electricity from nuclear power. Areas where the Division
   has contributed significantly to Argonne-developed leading edge
   technologies include:

     * Safety technology and assessments, including design basis and
       beyond design basis accidents
     * Improved plant operations, monitoring and control
     * Management of existing and future spent fuel inventory
     * Assessments of materials degradation for plant life extension and
       improved component performance
     * Improved calculational methods for current and advanced reactors,
       with incorporation of advanced computing and communications
       technologies

   The Reactor Engineering Division's long association with the
   development of nuclear power generation has given the Division an
   extensive inventory of facilities, equipment, and computer codes that
   have broad application to current generation and advanced nuclear
   reactor designs. In addition, a number of special-purpose computer
   codes have been developed by the Reactor Engineering Division to
   analyze particular aspects of the behavior of nuclear reactors.

   The Reactor Engineering Division works closely with other divisions
   within the Laboratory that are involved in Nuclear Technologies
   Research and Development so that the combined technical resources of
   the Laboratory can be focused on problem solutions.
