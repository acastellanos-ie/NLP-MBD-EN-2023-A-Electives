     To find the status of a license, select a license type from the list
                                    below.

               Use the following helps to complete your search:

     * Enter the first and/or last name.
     * If you know the license number, use the number only.
     * Do not use the prefix for a license number.
     * Do not use the name and the number.
     * A city or county name will narrow the search.
