SeaDAS - SeaWiFS Data Analysis System

   SeaDAS is a comprehensive image analysis package for the processing,
   display, analysis, and quality control of all SeaWiFS data products
   (L0, L1A, L1B, L2, L3 Binned, L3 SMI, L1A-, L2-, L3-Browse) and
   ancillary meteorological and ozone data. Capabilities for processing
   CZCS,  ADEOS / OCTS and MOS data are also included in SeaDAS.
   Display-only capability is available for MODIS Ocean Products as well
   as AVHRR SST files. SeaDAS is supported by the NASA ocean biochemistry
   program under UPN S79-11-03-20 to Gene Feldman (P.I.)

Current Status:

     * SeaDAS 4.1

     * All SeaDAS 4.1 source code and binaries are freely available for
       download via FTP.
     * Patch #1 for SeaDAS 4.1 is now available.  If you downloaded prior
       to 11/30/01 15:00:00 EDT, you need to get this patch to fix a
       problem with the msl12 program's ability to save and load parameter
       files, and to submit the job in the background.  If you downloaded
       after 11/30/01 15:00:00 EDT, you will not need this patch, as the
       fix is included in the regular tar file distributions.
     * New features in SeaDAS 4.1 vs. SeaDAS 4.0
     * A new SeaWiFS calibration table was put into production as of Dec
       18 2001 00:00:00 (EST).  All level-2 and higher products with a
       processing time later than "2001352000000" will have used this
       version of the calibration table.  You can download this new
       calibration table by clicking here, or you can manually download
       the file through ftp by going to
       ftp://samoa.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/sdps/Cal_Table.  Once you obtain the
       file, place it in the $SEADAS/data/seawifs/cal directory, and
       change the soft link so that it points to the new table.  Remember,
       when downloading the table through your browser, if you left-click
       on the link, you will get a bunch of indecipherable garbage in your
       browser window.  Right-click on the SEAWIFS_SENSOR_CAL.TBL-200009
       link, and select "Save Link As..." in order to save the file to
       your hard drive.
