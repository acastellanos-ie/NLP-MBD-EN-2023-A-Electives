   Charter Document.
   The GPS Applications Exchange Web site has been formed to establish a
   neutral site that showcases the many uses of GPS throughout the world.
   Representatives of the GPS community have volunteered their time and
   support to establish the GPS Applications Exchange Internet site
   initially hosted by the Earth Science Applications Directorate at
   NASA's Stennis Space Center.
   The site provides an open architecture with invitation for submissions
   from anywhere in the world. Applications submitted will be reviewed to
   ensure that any and all text and graphic descriptions of GPS
   applications are accurate and non-advocacy (e.g., do not represent
   marketing promotions for a given GPS product or service). The web site
   is designed to enable:
     *  Access to the full portfolio of GPS application profiles
     *  Submission of GPS application profiles from anywhere in the world
     *  Organization of the GPS profiles by geography
     *  Organization of the GPS profiles by application type
     *  Access to educational and tutorial materials on GPS

   Our goal is to have the GPS Applications Exchange viewed by the global
   community as a credible source of non-technical, realistic, objective
   information on the many practical ways that GPS is critically affecting
   countries and regions throughout the world.
