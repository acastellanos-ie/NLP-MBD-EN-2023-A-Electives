                     Welcome to the home of the MCNPX code!

   MCNPX is a general-purpose Monte Carlo N-Particle code that extends the
   capabilities of the Los Alamos MCNP code. Among other new capabilities,
   MCNPX extends MCNP with support for additional particle types, new
   cross section libraries, and the ability to use physics models for
   energies where tabular data are not available.

News and Announcements

   A new section for MCNPX classes has been added. There is a new Classes
   button over at your left.

   We have removed the access to the Data section from the beta test code
   page. It was redundant as there is a perfectly good Data button over at
   your left...

   A white paper discussing our thoughts on future directions for MCNPX
   version 3 is available in the Documents section. Comments are welcome.

   The Manual button that used to be on your left has been removed. It was
   redundant as the same information is reached from the Documents
   section.

   The MCNPX code is developed by the Accelerator Production of Tritium
   Project and Advanced Accelerator Applications at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory.
