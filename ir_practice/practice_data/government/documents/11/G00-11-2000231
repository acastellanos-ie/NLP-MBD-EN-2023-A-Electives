     Welcome to the California Energy Commission's Jobs/Exams Page.

     The Energy Commission is always looking for talented individuals (as
     our Mission Statement says) "..to (help) assess, advocate and act

     promote a strong economy and a healthy environment."

     * If you are currently not in the California State Civil Service and
       would like to apply for job vacancies with the California Energy
       Commission or any other state agency you must first take a state
       examination. Please go to our Exams page.
     * If you are already in state service, please visit our Job
       Opportunities page.
     * If you are currently an undergraduate student or graduate student

    It is the objective of the State of California to achieve a drug-free
    work place. Any applicant for state employment will be expected to
    behave in accordance with this objective because the use of illegal
    drugs is inconsistent with the law of the state, the rules governing
    civil service, and the special trust placed in public servants.
