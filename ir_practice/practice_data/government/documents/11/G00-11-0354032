                                Mission & Spacecraft Library (MSL)

              Welcome to the Mission and Spacecraft Library, a public source for
   information about spacecraft. All kinds of spacecraft. Big spacecraft,
   and small spacecraft. American, Soviet, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, and
   Luxembourgian (?) spacecraft. Research, communications, astronomy,
   navigation, and spy satellites. You name it, it's probably here,
   including a few you probably wouldn't expect to find. The purpose of
   the library is to provide a general overview of these space missions to
   the average reader, not just those fluent in aerospace geek speak.

   If you've been here before, you know how this works, so go ahead and do
   it. First time visitors will probably want to read an introduction to
   what is contained in the database, learn how you can search through it,
   and find out how to provide comments and corrections to the authors.
