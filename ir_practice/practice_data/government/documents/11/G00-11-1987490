   Dear Sir, My company (Webhelp, Inc., already on the GSA schedule)
   offers "LIVE" chat sessions that can be activated from your web site
   (most of our customers put a button on their web site such as "Have a
   Question? Click here") which will then activate the Live chat session.
   Our current clients are finding it is MUCH cheaper to use our service
   then it is to answer all of the clients phone calls. We offer services
   in almost every language, and anytime (7X24). We also offer e-mail
   answering solutions, along with a product called Co-Pilot which allows
   your help desk to take over and control the users PC to fix the problem
   without ever leaving their seat. We can do all of this for both
   Internally (Benefits, retirement questions, payroll questions, PC
   problems, etc.) or Externally (all of your clients
   questions/needs/problems) We would be glad to give you a demo and show
   you how we can reduce your support costs. If you could forward this
   e-mail to the appropriate person/division I would really appreciate it.
   Our sevices would fit nicely with your eGovernment inititive. I look
   forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you for your time. Tim Wine
   Program Development Manager

   I didn't see a link to the NSSB Web site. I'll ask someone in our
   office to follow up.

   I really like the financial information that is available through EIMS.
   It is a useful grants management tool. The EIMS office has been able to
   accomodate any type of report requested in a short turnaround time. It
   would be good if we could have a similar system for program information
   i.e number of customers served etc. is this information currently
   available? Also, does the E-gov strategy/vision include a a web based
   system for local agencies (such as Native American Tribes) where they
   will be provided a database system to manage their own data and would
   also provide DOL with aggregate data? Thanks, Duane
