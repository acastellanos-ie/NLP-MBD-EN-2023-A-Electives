   The Federal Procurement Data Center

   The Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC), part of the U.S. General
   Services Administration, operates and maintains the Federal Procurement
   Data System (FPDS). The FPDS is the central repository of statistical
   information on Federal contracting. The system contains detailed
   information on contract actions over $25,000 and summary data on
   procurements of less than $25,000. The Executive departments and
   agencies award over $200 billion annually for goods and services. The
   system can identify who bought what, from whom, for how much, when and
   where.
