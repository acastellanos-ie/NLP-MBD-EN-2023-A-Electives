   USGS
   Water Resources of Florida
   Data Reports

   Each year, the USGS produces a series of Water Data Reports for
   Florida, which include records of stream discharge and stage, lake
   elevations, ground water levels, and water quality data from
   measurements and samples taken throughout the year. Water data years
   run from October 1 through September 30. The reports are produced as
   Volumes 1-4, based upon the portion of Florida included in the Volume.
   Volumes 1-3 are each split into Volume A (Surface Water) and B (Ground
   water), but Volume 4 (Northwest Florida) includes both surface- and
   ground-water data in one volume.

   The most recent series of water data volumes is entitled "Water
   Resources Data, Florida, Water Year 1999" (USGS Water-Data Report
   FL-99). These volumes include water data collected between October 1,
   1998 and September 30, 2000.
