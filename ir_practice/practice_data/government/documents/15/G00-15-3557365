                              ATOMIC SPECTRA DATABASES


   Version 2.0   new   (new interface & expanded data)
          This database contains critically evaluated NIST data for
          radiative transitions and energy levels in atoms and atomic
          ions. Data are included for observed transitions of 99 elements
          and energy levels of 52 elements. ASD contains data on about 950
          spectra from about 1 Å to 200 µm, with about 70,000 energy
          levels and 90,000 lines, 40,000 of which have transition
          probabilities. The most current NIST-evaluated data associated
          with each transition are integrated under a single listing.



   Version 1.3  (earlier version)
          This database includes some of the existing critically evaluated
          NIST data on atomic energy levels, transition probabilities, and
          wavelengths that are reasonably up-to-date. This interactive
          database has energy level data for over 500 spectra, transition
          probabilities for Sc through Ni, and wavelength data for spectra
          of several elements.
