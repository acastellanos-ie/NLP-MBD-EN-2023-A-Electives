On-line Discussion Groups

   An exciting capability of the Internet is the advent of Mailservers to
   facilitate on-line discussions via electronic mail.

   Recently, two such mailservers have started, which are of potential
   interest to USGS MDIG members.
   1) The "ENVIROMINE" technical and issues mailservers, maintained by
       Robertson Info-Data, Inc., to facilitate discussions on
       environmental aspects of mining, and
       2) the "Cleanstream" listserver, maintained by the Office of
       Surface Mining, to provide a forum for communicating activities
       relate to the Appalachian Clean Streams Intitiative.

   Following are announcements provided by the sponsors of these two
   mailservers The ENVIROMINE announcement also contains some information
   on the World Wide Web home page (see Other Links of Interest). Thanks
   to Elliott Spiker for providing the information on Cleanstream, which
   also has a related WWW home page (see Other Links of Interest).

   Please Note: The Enviromine discussion group has been split into two
   groups:
   ENVIROMINE_TECHNICAL and ENVIROMINE_ISSUES
   For the latest instructions on subscribing to the ENVIROMINE discussion
   groups, see: http://www.enviromine.com/

  ENVIROMINE_TECHNICAL MAILING LIST

   (Mine/Environmental Discussion Group)

   June 16, 1998 Update

   Robertson GeoConsultants Inc offers a MAILING LIST Discussion Group on
   mining-related environmental technology and management. Certain members
   of the Western Governor's Association Mine Waste Task Force and several
   consulting firms, mining industry, and federal government
   representatives have agreed to assist as mentors in providing technical
   input and to help solicit participation from a wider Internet audience.
   Discussions are encouraged in the following areas:
     * Reclamation
     * Pollution prevention
     * Operating/engineering design
     * Waste management practices and requirements
     * Case histories (active operations and abandoned mines)
     * Acid rock drainage (prediction, control, and mitigation)
     * Environmental monitoring

   Anyone interested in the technical aspects of environmental effects and
   controls at mining operations will find this Internet service
   particularly valuable. The ENVIROMINE_TECHNICAL discussion group
   represents an opportunity to keep abreast of the latest breaking
   developments in the area of environmental technology and management at
   mine sites. If you are an industry representative, regulator, policy
   maker, technology developer, technology user, consultant, or a member
   of an environmental group, academia, or the general public interested
   in mining, you will want to participate in the ENVIROMINE_TECHNICAL
   discussion group.

  "ENVIROMINE_ISSUES" MAILING LIST

   (Mine/Environmental Discussion Group)

   Robertson GeoConsultants Inc. offers a MAILING LIST Discussion Group on
   mining-related environmental issues which are non-technical (i.e.,
   qualitative impacts, socio-economic, cultural, political or
   regulatory). Certain members of the Western Governor's Association Mine
   Waste Task Force and several consulting firms, mining industry, and
   federal government representatives have agreed to assist as mentors in
   providing input and to help solicit participation from a wider Internet
   audience. Discussions are encouraged in the following areas:
     * Laws, regulations and permit requirements.
     * Identification and evaluation of environmental effects and issues.
     * Permit and project review processes.
     * Public involvement and relations.
     * Cultural and land-use issues.

   Anyone interested in the evaluation and regulation of environmental
   effects of mining operations and public interaction will find this
   Internet service particularly valuable. The ENVIROMINE_ISSUES
   discussion group represents an opportunity to keep abreast of the
   latest breaking developments in the area of environmental effects and
   issues at mine sites. If you are an industry representative, regulator,
   policy maker, consultant, or a member of an environmental group,

   Here is some information about the cleanstream listserver:
   >>>> info cleanstream
       [Last updated on: Tue Jan 31 10:08:08 EST 1995]
       The "Cleanstream" list is a forum for communicating activities
       related to the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative (ACSI). OSM has
       staff working on ACSI in the Washington and Pittsburgh regional
       offices; in each Field Office in Appalachia; and in TIPS Denver
       office. These staff will need to inform each other about contacts
       made with congressional staff, citizens, community organizations,
       watershed associations, state agencies, EPA, etc.
       There will also be explanations of ACSI goals; discussions about
       funding of acid mine drainage remediation projects; project
       descriptions and status reports; explanations of AMD clean-up
       technology; citizens' guides; project selection guidelines; ACSI
       geographic information system (GIS) planning and design
       information/instructions; file transfers; reports of field data
       collection activities; discussion of ACSI policy and procedures;
       notices of upcoming ACSI meetings and technology transfer events;
       media and public relations opportunities; and general ACSI
       coordination messages. Eventually the list server will be available
       to other state and Federal agencies and anyone interested in ACSI.
       The descriptors should be:

   - funding of ACSI acid mine drainage remediation projects
       - ACSI project descriptions and status reports
       - explanations of AMD clean-up technology
       - citizens' guides to ACSI
       - ACSI project selection guidelines
       - ACSI geographic information system (GIS) planning and design
       information/instructions
       - file transfers
       - reports of ACSI field data collection activities
       - discussion of ACSI policy and procedures
       - notices of upcoming ACSI meetings and technology transfer events
       - media and public relations opportunities
       - ACSI coordination messages

   The list administrator is Mary Ann Miovas of the ESC office. She can be
   reached at mmiovas@osmre.gov or 412-937-2883.
