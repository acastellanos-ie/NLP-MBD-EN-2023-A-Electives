National Convective Weather Forecast (NCWF)

   The National Convective Weather Forecast (NCWF) is a new aviation
   weather product recently approved by the FAAs Aviation Weather
   Technology Transfer Board.  The NCWF is an automatically generated
   depiction of current convection and extrapolated significant current
   convection.  It is a supplement (not a substitute) to convective
   SIGMETs. Used in conjunction with other weather products such as
   convective SIGMETs, the NCWF provides additional information for
   convective weather avoidance and flight planning.  Detailed information
   on the NCWF.

   The NCWF is available from the Aviation Weather Center's Aviation
   Digital Data Service (ADDS), and selecting Convection.

   For further information on NCWF, please contact the FAA Flight
   Operations Branch, AFS-410,  Hooper Harris, at (202) 267-7186 or by
   emailing hooper.harris@faa.gov.
