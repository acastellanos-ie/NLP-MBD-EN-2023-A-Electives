                                Project Areas

     We divide our work into four main project areas:

   ENERGY STAR program support

     The end-use forecasting team provides extensive analytical support
     for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's voluntary ENERGY STAR
     programs. EPA uses the ENERGY STAR label to recognize and promote
     the most energy efficient products, thereby tapping market forces to
     promote energy efficiency and reduce pollution. We use technology
     and market data to help EPA target their marketing and design new
     programs, addressing most end-uses in the building sector.

   Technology data and modeling

     Energy data are abundant, but the right data for making policy
     decisions are not always available in usable form. The projects
     described here compile technology data for all major end-uses in
     residential and commercial buildings, incorporate them into computer
     models, and summarize them in widely-used reference reports. The
     reports include (where available) data on equipment shipments,
     shipment-weighted efficiencies, hours of use, annual energy use,
     insulation levels, window characteristics, prices for efficient
     products, minimum efficiency standards, and technology performance.

   Policy analysis

     Deeper understanding of policy questions often requires in-depth
     analysis. The reports in this section focus on issues central to
     evaluating how the future may unfold, particularly those related to
     technology adoption and defining resource potentials for efficiency
     and renewable power supplies. These studies also bear strongly on
     the current debate over the costs of reducing carbon emissions. Each
     report is exhaustively researched and extensively documented, and
     each draws upon available data and modeling tools.

   Network for Energy, Environment, Efficiency, and the Information
   Economy (N4E)

     N4E assesses in a comprehensive fashion the physical aspects of
     computing and communication network systems, and their associated
     resource flows and environmental impacts. To accomplish this goal,
     we track equipment sales, materials use, energy use, and emissions,
     and estimate stocks of equipment based on lifetimes and survey data.
     Our research covers all parts of the information technology supply
     chain, including manufacturing, distribution, purchasing, use, and
     final disposal of all types of computing and communication network
     systems. It also includes indirect effects on industrial processes
     and commercial organization insofar as these effects relate to
     energy use and environmental impacts.
