   Field Test Announcement, "Pedestrian Safety Engineering and Intelligent
   Transportation System-based Countermeasures Program for Reducing
   Pedestrian Fatalities, Injuries, Conflicts and Other Surrogate
   Measures."

   The U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (
   FHWA )is seeking applications from local jurisdictional governments (
   city, county, MPO or other local jurisdiction), to demonstrate and
   evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive pedestrian safety
   engineering and Intelligent Transportation System-based countermeasures
   program for reducing pedestrian fatalities, injuries, conflicts and
   other surrogate measures. The FHWA anticipates making multiple awards
   under this Request For Applications (RFA ).

   Award(s) will be made to determine the effectiveness of the combined
   pedestrian safety engineering and ITS countermeasures program. The
   award will comprise 2 phases. Phase 1 primarily consists of the
   development of a "Problem Identification and Countermeasure Selection
   Plan". Phase 2 consists of the implementation of the countermeasures as
   identified in Phase 1 and data collection to assist in the evaluation.

   Applications are due to FHWA by April 26, 2001. The RFA will be full
   and open and competitive. The entire RFA is published on the Electronic
   Posting System (EPS) at http://www.eps.gov and on the FHWA Home Page at
   http://www.fhwa.dot.gov. The solicitation number is DTFH61-01-X-00018.
