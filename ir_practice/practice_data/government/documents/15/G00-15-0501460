   The Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization (NEPO) Program is a U.S.
   Department of Energy (DOE) research and development (R&D) program
   focused on performance of currently operating U.S. nuclear power
   plants. The primary areas of focus for the R&D program are plant aging
   and optimization of electrical production.

   The NEPO Program is also a public-private R&D partnership with equal or
   greater matching funds coming from industry. The NEPO Program was
   initiated in fiscal year (FY) 2000. For FY 2000 and FY 2001, Congress
   approved funding of $5 million each year for the NEPO Program.

        104 commercial nuclear power plants produce one-fifth of U.S.
                                 electricity
