   GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER's First Annual
   Excellence in Information Science and Technology Award 2001

   Information Science & Technology logo The Spring 2001 Series concluded
   on May 23 with a special colloquium held in conjunction with
   presentation of the Center's first annual Excellence in Information
   Science and Technology Award.

   Congratulations to Mr. James Fischer and Dr. Christopher Lynnes,
   recipients of GSFC's First Annual Excellence in Information Science and
   Technology Award.

   This award is presented annually to the Goddard employee(s) who best
   exhibit(s) broad, significant contributions to Goddard programs or
   projects in the areas of information science and technology. The award
   recognizes career achievement or a specific act of exceptional merit
   that was completed in the previous year.

   This year's award recognizes Mr. James R. Fischer and Dr. Christopher
   S. Lynnes for individual accomplishments in information science and
   technology.

   Mr. Fischer's contributions opened a new era of massively parallel
   scientific processing. In the 1980's, he led the successful
   construction of the first Massively Parallel Processor (MPP) in the
   United States. The MPP was a 16,000 processor system with a single
   instruction multiple data stream. He launched the Frontiers of
   Massively Parallel Processing Conference in 1986, which has been
   instrumental in fostering the development of scientific applications
   for these systems. He has provided outstanding leadership to NASA's HPP
   Earth and Space Science Program. Mr. Fischer's vision fostered the
   development of the first Linux-based Beowulf cluster, which has since
   grown to become a pervasive computing tool in academia and government
   and a new product line for computer manufacturers. His many
   contributions have revolutionized high performance computing and have
   earned him world-wide recognition.

   Dr. Lynnes' greatest contributions to IS&T are the systems whose design
   and construction he led on behalf of NASA Earth Science research and
   applications, including the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center's
   (DAAC) first operational system, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring
   Mission (TRMM) Support System (TSS), the Web Hierarchical Ordering
   Mechanism (WHOM), which was a major contributor to the successful,
   timely processing of MODIS data and the Simple Scalable Script-based
   Science Processor (S4P). These contributions, plus Dr. Lynnes'
   expertise in applying state-of-the-art IS&T technologies to Earth
   Science needs have been truly exemplary and are internationally
   acknowledged.
