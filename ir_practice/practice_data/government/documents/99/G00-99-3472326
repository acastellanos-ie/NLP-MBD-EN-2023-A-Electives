          Powell Reaffirms U.S. Commitment to Afghan Reconstruction

    Secretary of State Colin Powell told Foreign Minister Abdullah of the
    Interim Authority of Afghanistan that the Afghan people can count on
                           continued U.S. support.

    "We did the military job, we're performing the humanitarian job, and
    we'll be there for the reconstruction effort," Powell told Abdullah.
   Powell and Abdullah spoke to the press following their luncheon meeting
                         on January 25 at the State
                          Department in Washington.

                     Planning Begins for Reconstruction
                           of Afghan Health Sector

     The Afghan Health Ministry and the World Health Organization (WHO)
                          begin a three-day meeting
     February 3 to plot a course for rebuilding the nation's devastated
                             health care system.

   A WHO press release says the Afghan health system "will be building up
    its health sector practically from scratch." After more than 20 years
   of conflict, the nation's medical infrastructure is so diminished that
   at least six million Afghans have little or no access to medical care.
