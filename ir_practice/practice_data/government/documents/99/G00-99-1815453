       Semiconducting and Metallic Polymers: The Fourth Generation of
                             Polymeric Materials


   When asked to explain the importance of the discovery of conducting
   polymers, I offer two basic answers: first, they did not (could not?)
   exist, and second, they offer a unique combination of properties not
   available from any other known materials. The first expresses an
   intellectual challenge; the second expresses a promise for utility in a
   wide variety of applications. I will review the development of this
   interdisciplinary scientific field and summarize recent progress in the
   science and technology.
