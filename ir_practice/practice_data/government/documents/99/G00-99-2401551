     __________________________________________________________________

   The TRMM Satellite Validation Office (TSVO) at NASA Goddard Space
   Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland is participating in the Keys Area
   Microphysics Project (KAMP), which is being held in the lower and
   middle Keys of Florida from August 15, 2001 through September 24, 2001.
   KAMP is an official part of the CAMEX-4 program, which is being based
   in Jacksonville, FL over the same period. Dr. Michael Biggerstaff of
   Texas A & M University is the Principal KAMP Scientist.

   While the official role of TVSO is to support both KAMP and CAMEX-4
   operations, additional effort and planning will allow the office to
   investigate the possible role of Key West as a principal Ground
   Validation (GV) site for TRMM.

   TVSO will deploy a number of rain gauges and several disdrometers along
   the lower and middle Keys, and will also provide staffing support for
   the new NASA Polarimetric Radar (NPOL) and the NASA/TOGA radar. TVSO
   will also set up and maintain a data processing center on Big Pine Key
   for copying and processing the radar, gauge and disdrometer data.
