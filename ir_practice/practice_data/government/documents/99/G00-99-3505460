                            Constituent Services

   Congressman Sanders' offices are able to assist Vermonters with a large
       number of requests and problems. Our constituent advocates help
      Vermonters get the assistance they need on many issues, including
     Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' needs, immigration,
                     housing, agriculture and education.

    If you need assistance, please contact our advocates directly through
    our Need Assistance? page or call (802) 862-0697 or 1 (800) 339-9834.

      Contacting us in either of these manners, as opposed to writing a
       letter or sending an email to Bernie, will help ensure a speedy
                  response to your request for assistance.
