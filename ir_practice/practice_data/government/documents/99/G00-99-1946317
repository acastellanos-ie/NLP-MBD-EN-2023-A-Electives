                              Precursor Studies

  I. INTRODUCTION

   The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) awarded fifteen Precursor
   Systems Analyses (PSA) research contracts totaling $14.1M to
   investigate the issues and risks related to the design, development,
   and implementation of Automated Highway Systems (AHS). These contracts,
   each of approximately one year duration, were awarded during the period
   July through September, 1993, based on a Broad Agency Announcement
   issued by FHWA in November, 1992. The AHS program is part of the major
   initiative of the US Department of Transportation in Intelligent
   Vehicle/Highway Systems.

   The purpose of this document is to highlight the research activities
   performed under the AHS PSA studies. These PSA studies were conducted
   as part of the early stages of the government's AHS Program. This
   compendium of AHS PSA research activities serves to highlight the areas
   of research and the contractor teams working within these areas.

   Included in this compendium is the following:

     * AHS PSA Contracts
     * Activity Area Summaries
     * Activity Area Matrices
     * Research Summaries

  II. AHS PSA CONTRACTS

   These fifteen PSA contracts were focused upon sixteen activity areas
   which were defined in the original Broad Agency Announcement. These
   activity areas are described in Table 1. Table 2 provides detail on the
   individual contractors and the activities they have addressed. Table 3
   is a list of contractors and subcontractors for each contract team.

   From Table 2, it is evident that several contractors addressed each of
   the activity areas. This overlap added value to the overall body of
   research, in that each discrete effort provided a different perspective
   and emphasis in identifying and analyzing issues and risks. Further,
   three teams, Calspan, Delco, and MITRE were selected to address all
   sixteen activity areas. These teams have generated additional insights
   into the issues because of the extensive interdependencies across the
   activity areas, which were addressed most effectively within a single
   contract team. The perspectives and experience of Calspan and Delco are
   highly complementary, with Calspan providing a broad systems analysis
   and Delco providing analysis from the perspective of the vehicle
   industry. Additional vehicle industry insights will be gained by
   subcontractors on the various teams, notably Ford Motor Company as part
   of the Raytheon team.

   The perspectives and experience of the highway engineering profession
   is crucial to this research, and transportation consultants are well
   represented within the contract teams performing the highway-based
   analyses. In order to enhance the results of the analyses and maintain
   a "real-world" perspective, frequent contact was made with state and
   local highway officials so as to gain feedback on issues such as AHS
   deployment, operations and maintenance, and network-wide impacts. In
   particular, the Calspan team included several state level
   transportation agencies for this purpose.

   These analyses benefited substantially from the experience and
   expertise of the defense industry, as several of the contractors
   selected have had extensive involvement with complex defense system on
   the scale of an AHS. For example, Lockheed Martin is the system
   integrator for the DOD Demo II project involving autonomous ground
   vehicles for military applications, which has clear technological
   similarities to the future AHS.

   There are four efforts shown in the "Other" column in Table 2. The
   Raytheon team investigated the application of Knowledge Based Systems
   to AHS requirements. The Rockwell team studied one possible
   evolutionary scenario for AHS. SRI investigated the application of the
   Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Carrier Phase techniques to
   vehicle position monitoring for AHS. Finally, TASC performed an
   analysis of the feasibility of integrating existing models in diverse
   areas such as vehicle dynamics, sensor characteristics, traffic flow,
   and environmental factors into a coherent modeling framework, to enable
   researchers to evaluate high level AHS concept alternatives.

   The PSA analyses were conducted in a highly interactive and
   collaborative environment. By creating an atmosphere of collegiality
   among the individuals performing the research. The program benefitted
   substantially from the resulting synergy. This group of PSA researches
   has displayed a broad range of perspective and expertise across both
   industry and government, in order to meet this objective.
