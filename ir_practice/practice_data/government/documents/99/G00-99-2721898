                               LITE Instrument

                              [instrument1.gif]

   The LITE instrument was carried in the Shuttle cargo bay on a standard
   Spacelab pallet. The instrument was mounted on an orthogrid platform
   attached to the pallet by 52 struts. The orthogrid is a support
   platform for the instrument subsystems and was designed to be immune to
   thermal deformations which could affect optical alignment. A
   description of the major LITE subsystems follows.

Receiver Assembly

   The receiver includes a one meter telescope and an aft-optics package.
   The telescope collects laser light scattered from the atmosphere, and
   brings it to focus in the aft optics. The aft optics includes
   wavelength selective optics to separate the return signal into its
   three color components. The 532 nm and 355 nm detectors are
   photomultiplier tubes, while the 1064 nm detector is a silicon
   avalanche photodiode.

Boresight Assembly

   The boresight assembly consists of a two-axis motor-driven prism. Its
   purpose is to align the laser beam to the telescope field-of-view so
   that both point to the same column of atmosphere.

Laser Transmitter Module (LTM)

   The LTM consists of two flash lamp-pumped, Q-switched Neodymium:YAG
   lasers which emit simultaneously at the three harmonically related
   wavelengths of 1064 nm (infrared), 532 nm (visible green), and 355 nm
   (ultraviolet). The two-laser system provides redundancy in case one
   laser fails. Only one laser operates at a time.

Orbiter Experiments Autonomous Support Instrumentation System (OASIS-I)

   The OASIS-I is a data-logging, subsystem which was used to record
   accelerations, acoustic loads, strains temperatures, thermal flux and
   pressures during the launch, ascent, on-orbit, descent, and landing
   phases of the LITE mission.

Camera Assembly

   The LITE camera is a modified half-frame 35 mm camera originally used
   for aerial reconnaissance. It was used to photograph the Earth's
   surface and cloud cover during the daylight portions of orbits when
   lidar data were acquired. A 25 mm focal length lens was used, giving a
   coverage of 200 X 200 km^2. The time interval between photographs is
   approximately 21 seconds, giving roughly 20% overlap between successive
   frames. A GMT time stamp recorded on each frame was used to determine
   the latitude and longitude on the surface of the Earth that corresponds
   to the center of each frame. LITE camera photographs may be obtained
   from the LITE Camera Photographs and Photos and Images pages.

   The LITE Camera Photographs page contains the entire set of LITE camera
   photographs. The photographs are available as JPEG images.

   The Photos and Images page contains the LITE camera photographs
   coincident with daytime LITE observations. The LITE camera photographs
   are displayed with color-modulated, altitude-time plots of daytime LITE
   (background subtracted) signal profiles for the 532 nm wavelength. The
   LITE photographs are available as JPEG images.

Instrument Controller

   The Instrument Controller (IC) handles all command and data interfaces
   of the LITE instrument. All subsystems could be commanded and
   controlled via the IC. Health and status of the LITE instrument are
   monitored and transferred to the Spacelab's Smart Flexible
   Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (SFMDM). The IC software consists of over 18
   real-time Ada tasks that perform all commands and data interfaces for
   the IC as well as autonomous operations.
