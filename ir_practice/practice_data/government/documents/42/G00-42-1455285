   Mercury contamination from historic gold mines represents a potential
   risk to human health and the environment. This fact sheet provides
   background information on the use of mercury in historic gold mining
   and processing operations in California, and describes a new USGS
   project that addresses the potential risks associated with mercury from
   these sources, with emphasis on historic hydraulic mining areas.

   Miners used mercury (quicksilver) to recover gold throughout the
   western United States at both placer (alluvial) and hardrock (lode)
   mines. The vast majority of mercury lost to the environment in
   California was from placer-gold mines, which used hydraulic, drift, and
   dredging methods. At hydraulic mines, placer ores were broken down with
   monitors (or water cannons, fig. 1) and the resulting slurry was
   directed through sluices and drainage tunnels, where gold particles
   combined with liquid mercury to form gold-mercury amalgam. Loss of
   mercury in this process was 10 to 30 percent per season (Bowie, 1905),
   resulting in highly contaminated sediments at mine sites (fig. 2).
   Elevated mercury concentrations in present-day mine waters and
   sediments indicate that hundreds to thousands of pounds of mercury
   remain at each of the many sites affected by hydraulic mining.

   High mercury levels in fish, amphibians, and invertebrates downstream
   of the hydraulic mines are a consequence of historic mercury use.
   Use of Water Cannons, circa 1860 Figure 1. Monitors (water cannons)
   were used to break down the gold-bearing gravel deposits with
   tremendous volumes of water under high pressure. Some mines operated
   several monitors in the same pit. Malakoff Diggings, circa 1860.

   On the basis of USGS studies and other recent work, a better
   understanding is emerging of mercury distribution, ongoing transport,
   transformation processes, and the extent of biological uptake in areas
   affected by historic gold mining. This information will be useful to
   agencies responsible for prudent land and resource management and for
   protecting public health.

   Origins of Hydraulic Mining

   Vast gravel deposits from ancestral rivers within the Sierra Nevada
   gold belt contained large quantities of placer gold, which provided the
   basis for the first large-scale mining in California. Around 1852,
   hydraulic mining technology evolved, using monitors (fig.1) to deliver
   large volumes of water that stripped the ground of soil, sand, and
   gravel above bedrock. The water and sediment formed slurries that were
   directed through linear sluices (fig. 3) where the gold was recovered.
   An extensive water transfer system of ditches, canals, and vertical
   pipes provided the sustained water pressure necessary for hydraulic
   mining. As mining progressed into deeper gravels, tunnels were
   constructed to facilitate drainage and to remove debris from the bottom
   of hydraulic mine pits. The tunnels provided a protected environment
   for sluices and a way to discharge processed sediments (placer
   tailings) to adjacent waterways.

   Deposits washed into sluices
   Figure 3. Gravel deposits were washed into sluices (from center to
   lower part of figure) where gold was recovered.
   Hydraulic mines operated on a large scale from the 1850s to the 1880s
   in California's northern Sierra Nevada region, where more than 1.5
   billion cubic yards of gold-bearing placer gravels were worked. In
   1884, the Sawyer Decision prohibited discharge of mining debris in the
   Sierra Nevada region, but not in the Klamath-Trinity Mountains (fig.
   4), where hydraulic mining continued until the 1950s. Underground
   mining of placer deposits (drift mining) and of hardrock gold-quartz
   vein deposits produced most of California's gold from the mid-1880s to
   the early 1900s. Dredging of gold-bearing sediments in the Sierra
   Nevada foothills has been an important source of gold since the early
   1900s. Mercury also was used extensively until the early 1960s in the
   dredging of flood plain deposits, where over 3.6 billion cubic yards
   were mined. Mercury is recovered today as a by-product from large- and
   small-scale dredging operations.

   Mercury Mining

   Most of the mercury used in gold recovery in California was obtained
   from the Coast Ranges mercury belt on the west side of California's
   Central Valley (fig. 4). Historic mercury production peaked in the late
   1870s (fig. 5).

   California. Source: MAS/MILS (Minerals Availability System/Mineral
   Information Location System) database compiled by the former U.S.
   Bureau of Mines, now archived by the USGS.
   Total mercury production in California between 1850 and 1981 was more
   than 220,000,000 lb (pounds) (Churchill, 1999). Although most of this
   mercury was exported around the Pacific Rim or transported to Nevada
   and other western states, a significant portion (about 12 percent, or
   26,000,000 lb) was used for gold recovery in California, mostly in the
   Sierra Nevada and Klamath-Trinity Mountains.

   Mercury Use in Hydraulic Mining

   In a typical sluice, hundreds of pounds of liquid mercury (several
   76-lb flasks) were added to riffles and troughs to enhance gold
   recovery. The density of mercury is between that of gold and the gravel
   slurry, so gold and gold-mercury amalgam would sink, while the sand and
   gravel would pass over the mercury and through the sluice. Because such
   large volumes of turbulent water flowed through the sluice, many of the
   finer gold and mercury particles were washed through and out of the
   sluice before they could settle in the mercury-laden riffles. A
   modification known as an undercurrent (fig. 6) was developed to address
   this loss. Fine-grained sediment was allowed to drop onto the
   undercurrent, where gold and amalgam were caught. The entire surface of
   the undercurrent (as much as 5,000 to 10,000 square feet) typically was
   covered by copper plates coated with mercury.

   Gravel and cobbles that entered the sluices caused the mercury to
   flour, or break into tiny particles. Flouring was aggravated by
   agitation, exposure of mercury to air, and other chemical reactions.
   Eventually, the entire bottom of the sluice became coated with mercury.
   Some mercury escaped from the sluice through leakage into underlying
   soils and bedrock, and some was transported downstream with the placer
   tailings. Some remobilized placer sediments remain close to their
   source in ravines that drained the hydraulic mines. Minute particles of
   quicksilver were found floating on surface water as far as 20 miles
   downstream of mining operations (Bowie, 1905).

   showing past-producing gold mines (as in figure 4) and major placer and
   hardrock gold mines. Source: USGS KNOWNDEP database (Long and others,
   1998). Averill (1946) estimated that, under the best operating
   conditions, 10 percent of the mercury used was lost and, under average
   conditions, the annual loss of mercury was up to 30 percent. Mercury
   use varied from 0.1 to 0.36 pounds per square foot of sluice. We
   estimate that a typical sluice had an area of 2,400 square feet and
   used up to 800 lb of mercury during initial start-up, after which
   several additional 76-lb flasks were added weekly to monthly throughout
   its operating season (generally 6 to 8 months, depending on water
   availability). Assuming a 10-30 percent loss, the annual loss of
   mercury from a typical sluice was likely several hundred pounds during
   the operating season. From the 1860s through the early 1900s, hundreds
   of hydraulic placer-gold mines operated in the Sierra Nevada. The total
   amount of mercury lost to the environment from these operations may
   have been 3-8 million lb or more, from estimates by Churchill (1999)
   that about 26,000,000 lb of mercury were used in California. Historic
   records indicate that about 3 million lb of mercury were used at
   hardrock mines in stamp mills, where ores were crushed. Mercury was
   also used extensively at drift mines and in dredging operations. The
   present distribution and fate of the mercury used in historic gold
   mining operations remains largely unknown, and is the focus of ongoing
   studies.

   The Bear-Yuba Project

   The northwestern Sierra Nevada region has been mined extensively for
   both its hardrock-gold and placer-gold deposits (fig. 7). The American,
   Bear, Yuba, and Feather River watersheds each have been affected by
   hydraulic mining. In the northwestern Sierra Nevada, the highest
   average levels of mercury bioaccumulation occur in the Bear River and
   South Yuba River watersheds (Slotton and others, 1997). USGS scientists
   (Hunerlach and others, 1999) have demonstrated a positive correlation
   of mercury bioaccumulation with intensity of hydraulic gravel mined in
   the Sierra Nevada (fig. 8). The Bear River and South Yuba River
   watersheds have been selected by the USGS and federal land management
   agencies (the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service) as well
   as state and local agencies (see last page) for detailed studies of
   mercury distribution in relation to historic mine sites. In April 1999,
   the study team began sampling water, sediment, and biota at mine sites
   identified as containing mercury "hot spots," where remediation might
   reduce risks to human health and the environment. The USGS is also
   analyzing mercury in sport fish from several lakes and streams in the
   Bear River and South Yuba River watersheds to allow assessment of
   potential risks to human health from fish consumption.

                           MERCURY CONTAMINATION:

                                 KEY ISSUES

   Risks to Human Health
     * Consumption of contaminated fish
     * Improper handling of contaminated sediments
     * Inhalation of mercury vapors
     * Low risk in municipal drinking water
     * Some mine waters unsafe for consumption

   Challenges for Land Management
     * Public access to contaminated areas
     * Physically hazardous sites
     * Environmental consequences of resource development
     * Remediation of affected sites

   Environmental Fate of Mercury
     * "Hot spots" at mine sites
     * Contaminated sediments
     * Transport to downstream areas
     * Bioaccumulation and biomagnification in food chain

   Mercury Methylation and Biomagnification
   Mercury occurs in several different geochemical forms, including
   elemental mercury [Hg(0)], ionic (or oxidized) mercury [Hg(II)], and a
   suite of organic forms, the most important of which is methylmercury
   (CH[3]Hg^+). Methylmercury is the form most readily incorporated into
   biological tissues and most toxic to humans. The transformation from
   elemental mercury to methylmercury is a complex biogeochemical process
   that requires at least two steps, as shown in figure 9: (1) Oxidation
   of Hg(0) to Hg(II), followed by (2) Transformation from Hg(II) to
   CH[3]Hg^+; step "2" is referred to as methylation. Mercury methylation
   is controlled by sulfate-reducing bacteria and other microbes that tend
   to thrive in conditions of low dissolved oxygen, such as the
   sediment-water interface or in algal mats. Numerous environmental
   factors influence the rates of mercury methylation and the reverse
   reaction known as demethylation. These factors include temperature,
   dissolved organic carbon, salinity, acidity (pH), oxidation-reduction
   conditions, and the form and concentration of sulfur in water and
   sediments.

   The concentration of CH[3]Hg^+ generally increases by a factor of ten
   or less with each step up the food chain, a process known as
   biomagnification. Therefore, even though the concentrations of Hg(0),
   Hg(II), and CH[3]Hg^+ in water may be very low and deemed safe for
   human consumption as drinking water, CH[3]Hg^+ concentration levels in
   fish, especially predatory species such as bass and catfish, may reach
   levels that are considered potentially harmful to humans and
   fish-eating wildlife, such as bald eagles.

   Fish Consumption Advisories for Mercury

   Methylmercury (CH[3]Hg^+) is a potent neurotoxin that impairs the
   nervous system. Fetuses and young children are more sensitive to
   methylmercury exposure than adults. Methylmercury can cause many types
   of problems in children, including brain and nervous system damage,
   retardation of development, mental impairment, seizures, abnormal
   muscle tone, and problems in coordination. Therefore, the consumption
   guidelines in areas where CH[3]Hg^+ is known to occur in fish at
   potentially harmful levels tend to be more restrictive for children as
   well as for pregnant women, nursing mothers, and women of childbearing
   age.

   In the United States, as of 1998, there were a total of 2,506 fish and
   wildlife consumption advisories for all substances, of which 1,931
   (more than 75 percent) were for mercury. Forty states have issued
   advisories for mercury, and ten states have statewide advisories for
   mercury in all freshwater lakes and (or) rivers.

   In California, as of 1999, there were fish consumption advisories for
   mercury in 13 waterbodies, including the San Francisco Bay and Delta
   Region and several areas in the Coast Ranges affected by mercury mining
   (fig. 10; compare with fig. 4). Data on CH[3]Hg^+ levels in fish are
   presently insufficient for public agencies to determine whether
   advisories are warranted for lakes and rivers in areas affected by
   historic gold mining, such as the Sierra Nevada foothills.
