                         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

   Where do dentists work in the Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned
   Corps?

   The nearly 600 dental officers in the PHS Commissioned Corps work in a
   variety of agencies/programs throughout the Department of Health and
   Human Services (HHS) and in other Federal agencies.  The majority of
   dental officers are assigned to the following:
     * Indian Health Service (IHS) (50%);
     * Bureau of Prisons (BoP) (25%);
     * U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) (10%); and
     * Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) (3%).

   What are the entry requirements?

   You must:
     * be a U.S. citizen;
     * be under 44 years of age (age may be offset by prior active-duty
       Uniformed Service time and/or civil service work experiences in a
       PHS agency at a PHS site at a level commensurate with the duties of
       a commissioned officer);
     * have served less than 8 years of active duty if you are/were a
       member of another Uniformed Service (click here to access the
       Former/Current Uniformed Service members section);
     * meet medical requirements; and
     * pass an initial suitability investigation.

   In addition, you must have earned a D.D.S. or D.M.D. degree from a
   program which, at the time the degree was conferred, was accredited by
   the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental
   Association.  A current, unrestricted, and valid dental license in any
   of the 50 States, Washington D.C., the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the
   U.S. Virgin Islands or Guam is also required (recent graduates are an
   exception - see below).

   What if I just graduated from dental school and I don't have my dental
   license yet?  May I still apply?

   Yes, you may.  The PHS Commissioned Corps is the only Uniformed Service
   that provides this benefit.  If you have graduated from an American
   Dental Association-accredited program within a year of your
   call-to-duty date, you may be appointed to the PHS Commissioned Corps
   for a limited tour of duty not to exceed 1 year.  Evidence of licensure
   is required within that year for removal of the limitation and for
   retention in the Corps.

   How much will I earn?

   Compensation varies depending on factors such as grade/rank, years of
   training and experience (T & E) in your profession,
   base pay entry date (BPED), specialty training, geographic location of
   your duty station, and dependency status.  The minimum starting pay
   grade/rank for a dentist in the PHS Commissioned Corps is O-3 (LT).
   Dental graduates receive 8 years of T & E credit for schooling leading
   to the D.D.S. or D.M.D. degree, no matter how many years it actually
   took to obtain that degree.  Additional T & E credit is earned for time
   spent after receipt of the qualifying degree in degree-related
   activities.  This could be:
     * paid or volunteer work
     * research
     * further training in your field (clinical practice, General Practice
       Residency, etc)
     * teaching at the college or university level
     * allied and relevant graduate studies and/or research

   For further information on pay, click
   Pay on the home page.  For further information on T & E and how an
   officer's starting rank is calculated, click the section on the
   Training and Experience Date.

   Am I eligible for any bonuses and/or special pay?

   Yes, dentists are eligible for both contractual special pay bonuses and
   monthly special pays.  Special pays for dental officers include an
   Accession Bonus (AB), Variable Special Pay (VSP), Board Certified Pay
   (BCP), Additional Special Pay (ASP), and a Multiyear Retention Bonus
   (MRB).

   AB
   is a payment of $30,000 to all qualified dentists who execute a
   contract to serve on  active duty for 4 years.  The contractual
   agreement must be signed within 60 days of the officer's call to active
   duty.  Officers are not eligible to receive the bonus if entering the
   Commissioned Corps as an inter-service transfer, with prior extended
   active duty in any Uniformed Service within 24 months of their call to
   duty in the Commissioned Corps, or to fulfill scholarship and/or
   training obligations.

   VSP is a monthly special pay that is available to all dentists based on
   years of creditable service.  The creditable service entry date (CSED)
   reflects the officer's years of active duty as a dental officer in any
   of the Uniformed Services and/or the years spent participating in an
   accredited dental internship or residency training while not on active
   duty in a Uniformed Service.  VSP rates range from $3,000 to $12,000,
   depending on CSED.

   BCP is a monthly special pay based on board certification in a
   specialty recognized by the American Dental Association, Federal
   Services Board, or American Board of Oral Medicine, Oral Diagnosis, or
   Oral Radiology.  Rates range from $2,500 to $6,000 annually based on
   years of CSED.  In order to receive BCP, you must provide documentation
   of the certification.  Please note that the National Dental Examiners
   Board is not a specialty exam board and does not entitle you to BCP.

   ASP is payable to all dental officers who execute a contract to remain
   on active duty for at least 1 year and meet the eligibility
   requirements.  Amounts range from $4,000 to $15,000 annually, depending
   on CSED.

   MRB is payable to dental officers trained in recognized dental
   specialties who execute a contract to remain on active duty for a
   period of 2 to 4 years and who meet the eligibility requirements.  The
   rate of MRB is dependent on the dental officer's specialty training and
   length of contract, and ranges from $3,000 to $14,000 annually.

   All contractual bonuses are prepaid lump sum payments.  ASP and MRB are
   paid in annual installments and all special pays are taxable income.
   If called to duty under a license-limited tour, contractual bonus
   payments are held pending removal of limited tour.

   What professional groups are available in the Commissioned Corps?

   You are encouraged to find out more about the Dental Category
   Professional Advisory Committee (DePAC). The DePAC exists to provide
   advice and consultation to the Surgeon General on issues related to the
   professional practices and personnel activities of all PHS dentists.
   The DePAC also provides advisory assistance to the Chief Dental Officer
   and to the agency and/or program heads where dental officers work.  All
   members of the dental category may express their concerns and voice
   their opinions through the DePAC.  The current members of the DePAC
   represent a cross-section of interests, professional experience and
   responsibilities.  The more dentists who contribute to PAC projects and
   activities, the more representative the products and policy
   recommendations will be.  If interested in joining, please contact the
   DePAC Chairperson, CAPT Terrell J. Hoffeld, at th88q@nih.gov or (301)
   435-1781.

   You are also encouraged to join the
   Commissioned Officers Association (COA), the only professional
   association specifically representing the PHS Commissioned Corps.  In
   addition to being a "voice on Capitol Hill," COA offers its members a
   range of services, including a strong professional network, financial
   services, and an annual scientific meeting.  The annual meeting,
   usually held in late spring, is an excellent opportunity to meet
   colleagues from other agencies/programs, to exchange scientific and
   career information, and to earn continuing education credits.  For
   membership information, please call (301) 731-9080 or visit COA's web
   site at www.coausphs.org.
