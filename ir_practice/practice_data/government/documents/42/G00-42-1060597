                  Metallurgy Division Historical Background

     location at Connecticut Ave and Van Ness St in Washington, DC.

             Constitution of the United States, Article 1, ยง 8

     The Congress shall have power ... To coin money, regulate the value
      thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and
                                 measures...

Act of 3 March 1901, 31 Stat. 1449 (Public Law 177 - 56 Congress) - An Act to
                 establish the National Bureau of Standards

   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
    States of America in Congress assembled, That the Office of Standard
   Weights and Measures shall hereafter be known as the National Bureau of
                                 Standards.

Early History*

   The Metallurgy Division was founded as part of the National Bureau of
   Standards in 1913. Early investigations related to the constituents of
   railroad iron and steel, of heat stress and heat treatment and related
   problems in the manufacturing process. Other studies included the
   chemistry of metals and metal alloys, properties of metals at high
   temperatures, the working of metal in the foundry process, and testing
   of metals for compliance with Government specifications.

                                Emory Machine
    The 2,300,000-pound Emory testing machine for making exhaustion tests
       of beams, girders, and other large metal structure components.

   During World War I, the Metallurgy Division conducted armament steel
   research, investigated the chemical, mechanical and structural
   properties of aluminum and duralumin (for airplanes), brass (for
   ammunition), new alloys of steel (for armor), the use and conservation
   of tin in solder, the use of platinum, rhodium, irridium, and palladium
   (for catalytic reactions), as well as the new concepts of quantitative
   composition measurement and control in the manufacturing process.

                                Rolling Mill
   The experimental 16-inch rolling mill for both hot and cold-rolling of
                           plates, rods, or bars.

   In the 1920s and 1930s, the Metallurgy Division made advances into
   understanding corrosion processes in metals, high temperature creep in
   alloys, the properties of magnesium alloys, the metallurgy of nickel
   and its alloys, the testing of tool steels, and the mechanical
   properties of cast iron. In the 1940s, testing methods were developed
   for use by the steel welding industry, the influence of boron on the
   hardening of steels, as well as the stabilization of austenitic
   stainless steels.

   The Metallurgy Division has been declared a historical landmark by the
   American Society of Materials for important developments in
   precipitation hardening of alloys.
