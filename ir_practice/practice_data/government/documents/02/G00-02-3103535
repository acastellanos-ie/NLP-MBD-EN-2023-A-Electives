              This is the web site of Richard A. Muller. I am a Professor in the

     Physics Department at the University of California at Berkeley, and
     Faculty Senior Scientist at the
     Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, where I am also associated with the
     Institute for Nuclear and Particle Astrophysics.

     Physics for future Presidents. That is my name for Physics 10, the
     course that I am currently teaching. In one semester, the goal is to
     cover the physics that future world leaders need to know. (And maybe
     present world leaders too....) Look at the PffP 2001 web page (for
     last semester), or the new (but less complete) PffP 2002 web page
     for the current semester. You will find links to the chapters of the
     book I am writing for the course.

     TERRORISM: Read my analysis posted last October 26: the terrorist
     threat is over, for now. That was posted when the US government
     announced an imminent "second wave". My analysis said the second
     wave had already occurred, and was a dud.
     Posted last month: Analysis of the Terrorist Attack, written on Sept
     16. The War on Terrorism posted on Sept 21, 2001.

     Last semester I taught Physics H7B.

     Impacts on the moon (and the earth) increased dramatically about 400
     Myr ago, a discovery that has recently been published in SCIENCE.
     This discovery has implications both for evolution and our model of
     the solar system.

     See the new compilation of ice age data we call the Benthic Stack.
     This stack was tuned to obliquity alone, and represents a new view
     of climate for the last 860 kyr. We have also plotted the component
     cores from the stack. A paper describing the stack in detail has
     been submitted for publication.


   [IceCoverSmall.jpg] My book Ice Ages and Astronomical Causes (with
   coauthor Gordon MacDonald) has recently been published by
   Springer-Praxis. Click to read the Table of Contents, the Preface or
   Chapter 1, which contains brief introductions to the History of
   Climate, Ice Age Theories, and Spectra. It is meant for students or
   researchers who want to learn how to do spectral analysis of
   paleoclimate data.It can be ordered from Amazon.com, from Springer New
   York, Springer Germany, and from Amazon in the UK. . For a wonderful
   movie illustrating the changing orbits, click here.

     I received the 1999 Distinguished Teaching Award of the University
     of California. My other awards are listed here. My feeling about the
     MacArthur Award is best expressed by a cartoon from the New Yorker.

     If you are interested in my novel about the life of Jesus, click
     here.

     My wife Rosemary is partner in the architecture firm of Muller &
     Caulfield. Among her recent projects is the new Thousand Oaks
     Elementary School in Berkeley.

     We took some interesting photos of Morocco, last summer.

     "1989 was 1984". Right? Not obvious? Then read my short commentary
     on George Orwell's novel, 1984.

                   This is Rich.

                                Rich (For a bigger photo,
                                     click on the image.)

   For photos of some of my colleagues, collaborators, and students, visit
   the photo gallery.

   I am sometimes confused with my namesake, Richard S. Muller, who is a
   professor in EECS, and director of the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator
   Center. But although our interests overlap, Richard S has no mustache.

   Yes, for six years, 1976-1982, I owned a restaurant called Inn Season.
   It was the craziest thing I ever did. You can see the announcement of
   opening, a sample menu, or just the logo. If anyone near and dear to
   you wants to open a restaurant, I can now be hired to talk them out of
   it. The restaurant was purchased and reopened as the Nagapan
   restaurant.

  Current Research

   I have three main research projects:
     * A New Theory of Glacial cycles. See the article Glacial Cycles and
       Astronomical Forcing, published in Science vol 277, pp 215-218 (11
       July 1997).
     * Determining Cratering Rates on the Moon Using Lunar Spherules
     * The Search for Nemesis
     __________________________________________________________________

   Publications and books

   A somewhat out of date list of my publications is available.  In
   addition, I have written four books:

     * Nemesis (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988). Read Chapter 1: Cosmic
       Terrorist. I have some copies of this still available, if you can't
       find one at your local bookstore.
     * The Sins of Jesus (a historical novel, formerly called "The
       Confession of Jesus"). You may download selected chapters from this
       novel for free. Click here for more information.
     * The Three Big Bangs (with coauthor Phil Dauber, Addison/Wesley
       1996). Read Chapter 1.
     * Ice Ages and Astronomical Causes: data, spectral analysis, and
       mechanisms (with coauthor Gordon MacDonald). See the note posted
       above.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In my spare time...

   I enjoy skiing, backpacking, photography (e.g. "Dandelion"), magic, and
   racquetball. (See the now inactive physics racquetball challenge ladder
   and the racquetball rankings.
