                             Profiles in Science

   Welcome to the National Library of Medicine's Profiles in Science site!

   This site makes the archival collections of prominent twentieth-century
   biomedical scientists available to the public through modern digital
   technology. The collections have been donated to the National Library
   of Medicine and contain published and unpublished materials, including
   books, journal volumes, pamphlets, diaries, letters, manuscripts,
   photographs, audio tapes, and other audiovisual materials.

     * Barbara McClintock
       Barbara McClintock (1902-1992) was an American geneticist who won
       the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering the
       ability of genes to change position on the chromosome.

     * Marshall Nirenberg
       Marshall W. Nirenberg (b. 1927) is an American biochemist who
       shared the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work
       on deciphering the genetic code.
       (Available May 2001)

     * Christian Anfinsen
       Christian Boehmer Anfinsen, Jr. (1916-1995), was an American
       biochemist who shared the 1972 Nobel Prize for work that helped

       (Available November 2000)

     * Julius Axelrod
       Julius Axelrod (b. 1912) is an American pharmacologist and
       neuroscientist who shared the 1970 Nobel Prize for his discovery of

     * Martin Rodbell
       Martin Rodbell (1925-1998) was an American biochemist and molecular
       endocrinologist who shared the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his
       discovery of G-proteins and the principles of signal transduction
       in cellular communication.

     * Oswald T. Avery
       Oswald T. Avery (1877-1955) was one of this country's first
       molecular biologists, whose findings proved that the genetic
       material is DNA.
