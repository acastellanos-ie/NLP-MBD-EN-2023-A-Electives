                               VIRTUAL LIBRARY

   The United States of America has always had an information
   infrastructure, going back to smoke signals. But today the nation is
   developing an information infrastructure with unprecedented
   sophistication and benefits for all Americans. The modern National
   Information Infrastructure (NII), sometimes called the "information
   superhighway," is an interconnection of computers and telecommunication
   networks, services and applications. To learn more about what it is and
   how it works, click above on the words "National Information
   Infrastructure."

   The NII Virtual Library is the home of the U.S. component of the Global
   Inventory Project (GIP) and the home of the international registry for
   the G8 Global Marketplace SME Testbeds. Links to general information
   about the eleven G8 Pilot Projects are found at G8 Pilot Projects.
