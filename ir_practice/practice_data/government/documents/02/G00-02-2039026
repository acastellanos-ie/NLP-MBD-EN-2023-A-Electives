      Cosmic Journeys is a new series of space-science missions that will
      explore the essence of time, gravity, matter, and energy.

      What powered the Big Bang? What is the Universe made of? What is the
      nature of space and time? These are the key questions that Cosmic
      Journeys seeks to answer.

      New discoveries in space, such as evidence of a mysterious "dark
      energy" expanding the Universe and the apparent ubiquity of black holes
      of all sizes, have placed us on the verge of a scientific breakthrough
      that will revolutionize the field of physics. The moment is analogous
      to the dawn of the 20th century, when the discovery of the electron and
      other phenomena set the stage for the new paradigm of quantum physics
      and general relativity.

      Scientists are at the edge of their seats. In recent years, we have
      learned that 95% of the Universe is made of a type of matter or energy
      that we cannot see nor understand. Gravity may ripple across the
      Universe in waves, one of the last unverified predictions of Einstein's
      theory of general relativity. And certain cosmic rays, atomic particles
      moving at near light speed, possess an energy far greater than that
      which can be explained by modern physics.

      Cosmic Journeys brings together the traditionally independent camps of
      astronomers and particle physicists to search for unknown forces and
      new physics. The goal is to move beyond physics' "standard model" and
      establish a new set of natural laws that unites the currently
      immiscible pillars of quantum physics and general relativity.

      Physicists use particle accelerators, so-called "atom smashers," to
      create new forms of matter and energy by reproducing temperatures and
      densities seen in the early Universe, albeit at a miniscule fraction of
      the original total energy. Astronomers aim their telescopes at the
      cosmos to view the most energetic realms of space: the Big Bang, a
      black hole event horizon, star birth and death, and the intersection of
      vast galaxy chains. Cosmic Journeys space missions exploit new
      technologies that virtually place us at the feet of the ultimate
      particle accelerators, where crushing gravity strips time, matter and
      energy down to their true essence.

      Cosmic Journeys will bridge the gap between the infinite and the
      infinitesimal.
