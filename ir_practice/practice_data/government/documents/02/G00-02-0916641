     The first in a series of conferences addressing lessons learned and
     successful practices arising from September 11, including homeland
      security and critical infrastructure protection. We will focus on
     improving cooperation between private industry and local, state and
       federal governments as we address the challenge of ensuring the
   protection of essential services in the event of a terrorist attack or
                        significant security breach.

                          The Experts Consensus on
                        the Top Twenty Most Critical
                      Internet Security Vulnerabilities
                          Released October 1, 2001

    The SANS (System Administration, Networking, and Security) Institute
   and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) in the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a descriptive document of
    the Top Twenty Most Critical Internet Security Vulnerabilities. SANS
     and NIPC compiled this list with assistance from computer security
                experts in academia, industry and government.

       The Top Twenty Most Critical Internet Security Vulnerabilities
    description is valuable because the majority of successful attacks on
     computer systems via the Internet can be traced to exploitation of
   security flaws on this list. Organizations can use the Top Twenty list
       to help prioritize security efforts in order to close the most
          dangerous security holes in their computer systems first.

      This Top Twenty list is segmented into three categories: General
     Vulnerabilities, Windows Vulnerabilities, and Unix Vulnerabilities.

    The Top Twenty Most Critical Internet Security Vulnerabilities can be
                         found on the SANS Web site.

          Security tips are also available for home computer users.

     Carnegie Mellons CERT^Â® Coordination Center has developed a "Home
                          Network Security" guide.

   NIPC offers "Seven Simple Computer Security Tips for Small Business and
                   Home Computer Users" on their Web site.
