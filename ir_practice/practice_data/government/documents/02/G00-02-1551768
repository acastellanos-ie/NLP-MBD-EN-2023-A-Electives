   NASA Software of the Year 2001 - Generalized Fluid System Simulation
   Program
   When engineers at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in
   Huntsville, Alabama couldnt find software to meet their needs in
   analyzing rocket engine fluid flow they invented it. As requirements
   changed and needs evolved, so did the software. Now in its third
   version, Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP v3.0) has
   received accolades from NASA by being selected to share NASAs Software
   of the Year 2001. This versatile tool may soon be available to industry
   through MSFCs Technology Transfer Department. Click here for more
   details.

   NASA Marshall Space Flight Center proudly announces the successful
   commercialization of its retractable pin tool for friction stir welding
   (FSW) by MTS Systems Corporation and MCE Technologies, Inc. Under
   license from NASA, both companies recently introduced products that use
   NASA Marshall's retractable pin tool for FSW process improvements.

   Working with Marshall Tech Transfer
   The primary goal of the technology transfer program at NASA Marshall
   Space Flight Center is to encourage broad use of Marshall-developed
   technologies by American private enterprise. "Working with Marshall
   Space Flight Center Technology Transfer Department" is designed to
   expedite the process of doing business with Marshall. The various
   processes of technology transfer are discussed in detail. We welcome
   the opportunity to present our technology and extend and invitation for
   you to partner with Marshall Space Flight Center to maintain American
   industry as the world leader in technology development. Click here for

        The ability to travel into space allows the transfer of space
    technology into the daily lives of the American people. In fact, many
   of the technologies currently in place began with NASA's quest for the
     stars. Benefits reaped from technology transfer are far-ranging and
    touch each of us in everyday life-from advances in medical research,
         environmental protection, energy conservation, and computer
       applications to improvements in firefighting techniques, police
   protection, and emergency management. These technologies brought about
        by America's space program are available to private industry,
      universities and other Government agencies through Marshall Space
     Flight Center's Technology Transfer Department. Click here for more
