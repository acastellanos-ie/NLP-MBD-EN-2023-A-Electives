Welcome to the Division of Computational & Systems Biology!





   Our currently featured web services:
     * Fifth Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Event--CASP 2002
     * LLNL Protein Structure Prediction and Alignment Tools

    In this division, within the Biology and Biotechnology Program at Lawrence
    Livermore National Lab, we are are working in the areas of protein and DNA
    dynamics, catalysis, small molecule hydration and characterization, and
    ligand docking/screening, using molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry, first
    principles molecular dynamics, and docking.


   We are also working in the areas of homology modeling, comparative
   modeling and threading, as well as developing some new methodology. In
   collaboration with scientists at other institions we (KF, AZ) also
   carry out much of preparation and analysis for the biennial CASP
   contests, in which groups from around the world compete to best predict
   the previously unkown structures of proteins.

   The work of Mike Colvin and colleagues was recently featured in an
   article emphasizing the broad use of computers and simulations by this
   group. (A pdf version is also available.)
