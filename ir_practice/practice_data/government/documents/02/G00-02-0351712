  Introduction

   This page provides information on the U.S. Department of Interior,
   Office of Surface Mining, Mine Map Repositories located in Pittsburgh
   and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The repositories serve as reference
   facilities for information on abandoned surface and underground mines
   throughout the United States.

   The Office of Surface Mining was established by Congress with passage
   of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), Public Law
   95-87, in 1977. In that law, Congress sought to establish a nationwide
   program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects
   of surface and underground coal mining operations, and assure that the
   coal supply essential to the Nations energy requirements and to its
   economic and social well-being is provided. The Mine Map Repositories
   exist to satisfy the Title II requirements of SMCRA.

  Mission

   The Mine Map Repositories support Title IV and Title V activities of
   SMCRA. The repositories are in business to provide our customers with
   an expert service ranging from evaluating related data for economic
   analysis to assessing their potential risk associated with underground
   mining. Through our analysis of mine maps and related information, we
   assist both the private and public sectors in industrial and commercial
   development, highway construction and the preservation of public
   health, safety and welfare. In addition we collect, reproduce and
   maintain a national inventory of mine maps and supporting documentation
   for private and public interests.

  History

   In fiscal 1970, the U.S. Bureau of Mines initially funded four regional
   mine map repositories located in Denver, Colorado, Spokane, Washington,
   and Pittsburgh and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. This repository system
   was set up to obtain and microfilm maps of past mining operations in
   the United States. High priority was assigned to mine maps of areas
   where the adverse impact to the environment or public safety was most
   severe.

   In late 1984, responsibility for the Pittsburgh and Wilkes-Barre
   Repositories was transferred to the Office of Surface Mining, with the
   Denver and Spokane Repositories remaining with the Bureau of Mines.
   During fiscal year 1996, the Bureau of Mines closed their Denver and
   Spokane Repositories and all maps and related information were
   transferred to the Pittsburgh Repository. With the acquisition of these
   western mine maps, the Pittsburgh Repository expanded its mission
   nationally.

   The Pittsburgh Repository continues to collect and archive mine maps
   and to maintain a strong liaison with state and federal agencies. The
   Wilkes-Barre Repository is maintained as an archival facility for the
   anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania and no longer actively collects
   mine maps. However, maps are still available for viewing by the public.

  Repository Information

   Mine maps are acquired through an established vigorous outreach program
   with emphasis directed toward state and federal environmental agencies.
   Other sources included in this outreach are mining companies,
   engineering and consulting firms, surveying companies, universities and
   private citizens. Those wishing to donate mine maps for processing and
   archiving may do so by contacting the Pittsburgh Mine Map Repository.
   All maps donated are returned to the donor.

   Information contained on the mine maps are used to solve a wide variety
   of engineering, environmental, and mining problems. Mine map
   information is necessary for decisions on land use and development, the
   purchase of property, environmental protection, etc. The most frequent
   users of this information are state and federal agencies, mining
   companies, consultants, and engineering firms. Other users include
   research and planning organizations, real estate developers, highway
   engineers, pollution control boards, city and industrial planners, oil
   and gas companies, public organizations, special interest groups,
   universities, architectural firms, transit authorities, attorneys,
   private citizens and law enforcement agencies. Below is a list of
   information derived from mine maps:
     * Mine and company names
     * Main and secondary roads, haul roads, railroads, and mine tipples
     * Creeks, streams, rivers, ponds and lakes
     * Property ownership (mineral and/or surface), adjoining coal
       companies, towns, cities, and old railroad towns
     * Districts, townships, sections, ranges, counties, and
       municipalities
     * Latitudes and longitudes, elevation bench marks, surface
       elevations, north arrows, distance scales, and dates
     * Coal outcrop seam designation, seam thickness, coal elevations, and
       coal reserves
     * Man-ways, emergency exits, mine openings, barrier pillars, and
       ventilation facilities
     * Power and gas lines and gas and oil-wells
     * Preparation plants, storage areas, and water and power distribution
       facilities
     * Bore holes, mine seals, surface mining, and federal/state
       identification numbers

   Below are examples of the importance mine map information has been or
   is being used to address a variety of purposes.
     * Mining companies use mine maps in preparation of permit
       applications for new mines or for extensions of existing mines to
       identify and indicate the location and extent of any abandoned
       mines within the proposed permit and adjacent areas.
     * Local developers and real estate agencies are dependent on mine map
       information to assist them in making decisions relative to land
       use, property investigations, foundation design, etc.
     * Federal and state agencies utilize mine map information to conduct
       health and safety activities, such as mine rescue operations and
       mine sealing, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts resulting
       from landslides, subsidence, acid mine drainage, mine fires, etc.
     * Consultants and engineering firms use mine maps as a basic source
       of geological and engineering data to assist them with their
       clients projects.
     * Energy interests use mine maps to estimate reserves and locate and
       develop alternative energy supplies.
     * Private citizens use mine maps to determine the potential for
       subsidence in residential areas.

  Frequently Asked Questions

   What problems can be caused by past coal mining? The problems
   associated with past coal mining activity that can adversely affect
   structures, people and property are:
     * mine subsidence;
     * landslides;
     * mine drainage (including sudden mine blowouts);
     * abandoned mine openings (e.g., portals and mine shafts);
     * abandoned structures (e.g., tipples);
     * dangerous mine gases (e.g., methane and black damp);
     * mine fires; and
     * coal refuse fires.

   Please remember to NEVER ENTER AN ABANDONED MINE OPENING OR STRUCTURE.
   If you believe that any of these problem types might be a threat in
   your community, you should contact your state environmental agency for
   an evaluation. Such agencies can determine whether your problem
   qualifies for state or federal remediation. There is no assistance for
   property losses beyond subsidence insurance, which usually only applies
   for mine subsidence damage.

   What is mine subsidence? Mine subsidence is the sinking down of the
   earth's crust as a result of a structural failure in an active or
   abandoned underground mine. These underground failures can occur at any
   time and can result in damage or endangerment to property or persons.
   Some failures occur underground with no effects to the surface or occur
   in remote areas where the effects may not be noticed. However, many
   abandoned underground mines are located under heavily populated areas,
   such as Pittsburgh and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area in Pennsylvania,
   which can increase the potential for damage to homes and other
   structures. Evidence of mine subsidence are things such as sections of
   a building which begin to tilt, small cracks in foundations or basement
   or garage floors which begin to suddenly widen, growing separations
   between walls and floors, windows which begin to stick, jam or even
   break, or long, continuous cracks in the ground.

   How can I determine if my property has been undermined? Get an analysis
   of the mine maps within your area. A good first step toward this end
   would be to contact the Mine Map Repository or your state environmental
   agency. Other ways to determine that an area has been undermined
   include exploratory drilling, ground penetrating radar, and seismic
   soundings.

   Does a particular method of mining enhance the probability of mine
   subsidence? Yes. Several methods of mining are used to get minerals
   from underground. These methods include room and pillar mining,
   longwall mining, auger mining and surface mining. These methods use two
   basic types--partial extraction and full extraction. As a rule, the
   more mineral that is removed in a mining operation, the greater the
   likelihood of subsidence. The two types of mining most commonly
   associated with mine subsidence are room and pillar mining and longwall
   mining.

   Room and pillar mining uses partial extraction, where "rooms" of
   minerals are removed while leaving behind "pillars" of minerals to
   support the ground surface. These mines may be subject to subsidence at
   any time. Longwall mining uses full extraction. This method involves
   the removal of long panels of coal, with the goal being the complete
   removal of the coal in that area. Once the panel is completed, the area
   subsides in a relatively short period of time. The subsidence is
   planned to occur soon after the coal has been removed, usually within a
   couple of months and thus is predictable. Current longwall mining
   techniques are designed to allow all settling to be complete within a
   couple of years after which new development and construction can then
   safely occur.

   Because most of the mine maps only show the landmarks and roads that
   existed at the time of mining, the requestor must visit the repository
   in person to minimize the risk of misidentifying a site. Each visitor
   to the Wilkes-Barre Repository should have a detailed location of the
   site of interest, as well as a distance from a prominent street
   intersection or other applicable landmark.

   OSM staff will help visitors in locating the proper mine map, and
   interpreting the mining information. However, OSM staff will not assess
   the probability of future subsidence at any particular site. Subsidence
   often contradicts actual site conditions and is difficult to predict.
   OSM staff can provide the names of local independent consultants who
   can analyze the specific information and prepare a report on the mining
   conditions and potential for future subsidence.
