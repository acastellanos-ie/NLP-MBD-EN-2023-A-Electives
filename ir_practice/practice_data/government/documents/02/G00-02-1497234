                                  Focus On
   Aviation Security
   OIG has issued numerous reports and presented congressional testimonies
   on aviation security in recent years. OIG has also conducted several
   criminal investigations related to aviation security including the
   falsification of documents required by law or regulation to comply with
   aviation security requirements. A list of recent OIG recommendations on
   aviation security can be found here, and redacted versions of some OIG
   aviation security reports can be found at
   http://cas.faa.gov/readingroom/audit.htm. Additionally, on November 9,
   2001, President Bush instructed the Inspector General of the Department
   of Transportation "to conduct undercover audits of security performance
   at airports nationwide, to ensure the strict compliance of FAA security
   standards." The full text of the President's speech can be found here.
   Aviation security continued to receive headlines in December, as
   Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta announced, on December 11, the
   indictment of 69 workers at Salt Lake City International Airport on
   charges of falsifying their applications for airport security badges.

   Tracking Auto Defects
   In an audit requested by Senator John McCain, Ranking Minority Member
   of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the IG found
   that NHTSA has made progress in meeting TREAD Act requirements, but
   still faces challenges in fully implementing the act and improving its
   ability to identify potential safety defects. We recommended that
   NHTSA: (1) Issue regulations required under the TREAD Act in a timely
   manner; (2) Establish a peer review panel to ensure that data used to
   identify potential defects are thoroughly analyzed and investigations
   are opened and prioritized in a consistent manner, and identify
   techniques for collecting and analyzing defect information from a wider
   range of sources; and (3) Obtain the services of an independent entity
   to validate and verify the progress of Volpe National Transportation
   Systems Center to develop a new defect database and reduce development
   risks, and ensure that the data being transferred to the new system is
   accurate and complete. NHTSA concurred with our recommendations. To
