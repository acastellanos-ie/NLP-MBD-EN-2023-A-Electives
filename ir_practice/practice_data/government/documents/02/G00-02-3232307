   The Regulatory Information Service Center has established the
   REGINFO.GOV site to assist users who want to find information about
   Federal, state, and local regulation. The Center is a Federal
   Government office located in the General Services Administration, with
   responsibility for gathering and publishing information on Federal
   regulations. The Center provides this information to the President,
   Congress, agency officials, and the general public to help them better
   understand and manage the regulatory process.

   The principal publication of the Center is the semiannual Unified
   Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. The Agenda
   contains information about Federal regulations under development as
   required by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
   The fall edition includes The Regulatory Plan, which identifies Federal
   regulatory priorities and contains additional information about the
   most important significant regulatory actions that agencies expect to
   take in the coming year.
