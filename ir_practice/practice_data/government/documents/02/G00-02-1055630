   The Run II Joint Project has transitioned to the commissioning and
   operations phase. Operations MOUs between the Collaborations and the
   Computing Division are being developed.

   An Operations Needs Assessment is being developed. The Joint Project is
   working on  integration issues for  CDF and D0 . The Fermilab long
   range schedule defines when beam is expected. Mock Data Challenge and
   Data Handling (DAQ through analysis) milestones need to be met on the
   way.

                                  Background:

   The Joint CDF/D0/CD Run II Computing Project consists of a number of
   common projects and associated working groups to address the offline
   computing needs of D0 and CDF for Run II. The needs are defined through
   the two reports of the Needs Assessment Group (NAG)< as a result of its
   charge. The group had the following members.

   The project is described by the Project Management Plan, found here,
   and its Work Breakdown Structure. It has the following organization
   under the umbrella of the Steering Committee. Run II Joint Offline
   Committee meetings have Minutes. (1998 and 1997 and 1996). Project
   Status reports are available for Mar '99, Jan '99 and Nov '98. To
   register a document use the following form. The contents of the
   RunIIComputing mail list is available and you can request to be added
   to it. Apply here if you want to video conference to the meetings. Mail
   all comments on these web pages to the RunIISteering mail list.

   A Review Committee with the following charge was appointed for the
   Joint Computing Project with the following meetings: June 1997: Agenda
