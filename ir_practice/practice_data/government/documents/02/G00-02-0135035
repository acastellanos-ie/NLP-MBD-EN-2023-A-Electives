   Originally devoted entirely to the development of hot dry rock
   geothermal energy, the group now performs work in a great variety of
   other areas unrelated to geothermal energy. Current research areas
   include basic research into physical properties of earth materials,
   development of new seismic imaging methods using parallel computing,
   study of the the interaction of fluids in pore space and wave
   excitation, development of microborehole tools, study of reservoir
   microearthquakes, study of earthquake strong motion, and study of fluid
   flow in earth materials.
