   The Office of Coast Survey (OCS) produces nautical charts for United
   States waters, including its possessions and territories. OCS is an
   office within the National Ocean Service, NOAA, a United States
   Government Agency. It is, in fact, the oldest U.S. scientific
   organization dating back to Thomas Jefferson who established the office
   in 1807 to encourage commerce and to support a growing economy in a
   safe and efficient manner.

   Accurate, reliable, and up-to-date nautical chart information is more
   important today than at any time in the past. As margins of safety
   narrow, consequences loom greater as cargo capacities are pushed to the
   limit. To meet this challenge, more current and precise information is
   required. New electronic navigation systems can meet the demands for
   greater protection of life, property, and the environment, as well as
   significantly improve the efficiency of maritime commerce. Today the
   Coast Survey manages the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration's nautical chart data collection and information program
   to Promote Safe Navigation, a NOAA strategic goal.
