   This year promises to be exciting for TDA.  Our mission of fostering
   U.S. exports and development of emerging markets will be enhanced in
   2002.

   As a core priority, TDA promotes U.S. partnerships in high priority
   overseas projects.  TDA is increasing its international representation
   by opening offices in Thailand and South Africa.  These strategically
   located satellites join existing TDA presences in Croatia and Turkey.

   TDA also provides technical assistance to support infrastructure
   projects around the world.  Our talented and dedicated staff -- both
   U.S. based and in the field -- provides assistance to countries in
   making their development goals a reality.  Concurrently, we strive to
   uncover viable business opportunities for U.S. companies.

   As President George W. Bush recently said, "Cultures must preserve
   their unique values - yet everywhere - East and West, North and South -
   there is a model of successful development, a market economy trading
   with the world that respects human rights and the rule of law.  Every
   nation that adopts this vision will find in America a trading partner,
   an investor, and a friend." TDA looks forward to continuing to support
   this vision in the coming year.
