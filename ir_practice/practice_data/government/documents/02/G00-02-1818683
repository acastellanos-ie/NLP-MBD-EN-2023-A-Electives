                           The Greatest Experiment


   [cdf-ii.gif]

   The CDF features proton-antiproton colliding beams at 2 TeV energy, and
   is the premier hadron collider experiment in the world. The Texas A&M
   group has both Hardware and Software projects in Run II and is expected
   to play a leading role in New particle searches, especially in
   Supersymmetry.
