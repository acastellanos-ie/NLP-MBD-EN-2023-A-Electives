                 Enron = Why We Need Campaign Finance Reform

        Cong. Bernie Sanders JAN 30: In an editorial featured on the
   progressive web site Common Dreams today, Rep. Sanders cited the Enron
      scandal as exhibit #1 in the case favoring the need for immediate
      campaign reform. The now-defunct energy giant dolled out some $6
    million in campaign contributions at the same time that its business
    was failing. Sanders called Enron “a poster child of how a group of
    powerful corporate leaders come to exert enormous clout over elected
     officials and get the rules changed in their favor.” (FULL STORY)
