     Ion Beam Technology is a program that is part of the Accelerator and
     Fusion Research Division at the Earnest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley
     National Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. The
     Ion Beam Technology (IBT) program is dedicated to the investigation
     of plasma and ion-beam techniques for modifying and synthesizing
     materials in various fields and industry. Ion Beam Technology is
     divided into a number of groups and is headed by Richard A. Gough.

     * Plasma Applications Group
     * Plasma and Ion Source Technology
     * Medical Applications
     * Nuclear Physics
     * Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Front-End Systems
