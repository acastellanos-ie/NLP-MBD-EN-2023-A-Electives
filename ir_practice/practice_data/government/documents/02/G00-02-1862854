   Sandia "Detective" Solves Strange Case

   Sandia National Laboratories scientist's finding of a key detail leads to new
   interpretation of water-solid interactionsreported in the January 4, 2002,
   issue of Science.


   Molecules

      January 14It was a small problem: a layer of water lying flat instead
      of slightly bumpy as it froze on a solid.

      It became a larger problem when no one could explain why that might
      happen.

      The slight difference between experimental results and established
      expectations might have meant nothing. But possibly it was signaling a
      basic scientific misunderstanding concerning the interaction of water
      with solidsan area of major industrial and scientific concern.

   Sky Survey Lowers Estimate of Asteroid Impact Risk

   The odds of earth suffering a catastrophic collision with an asteroid over
   the next century are about one in 5,000, which is less likely than previously
   believed, according to research published by astronomers at the Sloan Digital
   Sky Survey in the November 2001 issue of the Astronomical Journal.


   Asteroids

      January 14Astronomers using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
      found that the solar system contains about 700,000 asteroids big enough
      to destroy civilization. That figure is about one-third the size of
      earlier estimates, which had put the number at around two million and
      the odds of collision at roughly one in 1,500 over a one hundred-year
      period.

      "Our estimate for the chance of a big impact contains some of the same
      uncertainties as previous estimates, but it is clear that we should
      feel somewhat safer than we did before we had the Sloan survey data,"
      said lead researcher Zeljko Ivezic of Princeton University.
