     NOAA History is an intrinsic part of the history of the United
     States and the development of its science and commercial
     infrastructure. The ancestor agencies of the National Oceanic and
     Atmospheric Administration include the United States Coast Survey
     established in 1807, the United States Weather Bureau established in
     1870, and the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries
     established in 1871.

   (USC&GS), a forerunner of NOAA, detailing the actions taken and
   observations made by an unarmed C&GS ship while returning from
   operations in the central Pacific Ocean to the relative safety of
   Seattle, Washington, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
