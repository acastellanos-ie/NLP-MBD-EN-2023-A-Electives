      Welcome to the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Center for Risk
      Excellence. The Center develops and implements policy practices,
      guidance, tools, support, and training that result in risk-based
      decisions that protect both human health and the environment.

                     Center for Risk Excellence Closing

   The past few months have seen difficult times for Federal Agencies and
   programs. New people and new priorities have required a reassessment of
   how limited funds will be spent. Unfortunately, the Center for Risk
   Excellence has been identified as a program that "will not be funded"
   in the Fiscal Year 2002 Budget. This means that the Center must close
   its programs and activities and seek new positions for the staff.
   Risk Excellence Notes, Final Issue

   Following the closing of the Center for Risk Excellence, its web site
   will remain online from an Argonne server for approximately six months.
   Without further support there will be only minimal changes in the web
   site during this period. There will be some effort to seek alternate
   funding for long term continuation of a web site that covers some of
   the important risk information, such as availability of technical
   documents on a variety of DOE risk-related topics.
