   OEP is an office within the U.S. Department of Health and Human

   Working in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
   (FEMA) and the Federal interagency community, OEP serves as the lead

   Response Plan.  OEP also directs and manages the National Disaster
   Medical System (NDMS) a cooperative asset-sharing partnership between

   Affairs (VA), FEMA, state and local governments, private businesses and
