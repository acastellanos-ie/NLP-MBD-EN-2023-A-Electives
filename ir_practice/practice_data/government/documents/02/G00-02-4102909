   TreasuryDirect customers speak!

   "It's hard to suggest improvements since it is almost too easy at
   present. I make an investment and relax, because I know everything will
   be correct and as I instructed."
     __________________________________________________________________

   "What I like is being able to call one number (800-722-2678) and speak
   directly to an individual who can help me. Nothing takes the place of a
   personal contact."
     __________________________________________________________________

   "I have used it for many years and always found it to be excellent for
   my extra retirement income. I cannot think of anything that would
   improve this service."

   BULLETINS:
   If you have tax questions, we have answers!

     * 5- and 10-year notes are reopened on a regular basis. If you buy or
       reinvest into a reopened security, you will owe accrued interest
       and possibly a premium. If an auction is a reopened auction, the
       offering announcement press release will show the accrued interest
       per $1,000. If you're using Pay Direct, we'll automatically collect
       the amount due when we collect your payment.
