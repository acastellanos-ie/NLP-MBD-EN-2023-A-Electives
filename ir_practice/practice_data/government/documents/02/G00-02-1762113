                   Buildings Research and Analysis at LBNL

   Approximately one-third of the energy consumed in the United States is
   used in buildings. The Environmental Energy Technologies Division at
   Berkeley Lab addresses building energy efficiency issues, including
   building technologies, the indoor environment, building codes and
   standards, and end-use energy efficiency issues, through
   multidisciplinary research and analysis. In our Building Technologies
   Department, we work closely with industry to develop efficient
   technologies for buildings that reduce energy bills while improving the
   comfort, health and safety of building occupants. Our technology
   efforts focus on windows and daylighting, lighting systems, building
   simulation research and commercial building systems. Our Indoor
   Environment Department researchers working in the buildings area focus
   on infiltration and mechanical ventilation systems and on human health
   and productivity in buildings, with an emphasis on indoor chemistry and
   exposure and on air flow and air quality modeling. Analysts working in
   our Energy Analysis Department gather and interpret information to
   examine the feasibility of different approaches to designing
   energy-efficient appliance standards and building codes in the U.S.,
   and have worked with developing nations to create programs, codes and
   standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage efficiency.

                         Commercial Building Systems

   In California, commercial buildings account for about one-third of all
   electricity consumption at an annual cost of $9 billion. A new
   three-year public-private research initiative under the leadership of
   Berkeley Lab, with major funding from the California Energy Commission,
   will target substantial reduction in the energy costs of commercial
   buildings, while improving the health, comfort and productivity of
   building occupants.
