   Argonne in the News
   Mixing up a concrete solution Â— Physicist Arun Wagh's research into
   industrial waste has led him to a better way to fill potholes and
   cavities, drill for oil and, perhaps, build affordable homes in
   developing countries. Chicago Sun-Times, Monday, Jan. 28, 2002.
   Steve Choi (left) and Jeff Eastman are working with industry to improve
   the understanding of nanofluids.
   What's New This Week:
   Taking the heat off: Nanofluids
   promise efficient heat transfer

   By manipulating atoms on the smallest of scales, Argonne scientists
   have created a next-generation fluid that may revolutionize heat
   transfer. By adding tiny spherical particles to a conventional fluid,
   researchers can improve by up to 40 percent its ability to transfer
   heat. Improved oils and coolants would make possible smaller, more
   efficient engines that use less fuel and do less damage to the
   environment. More...

   University competition to
   accelerate technology transfer
   O.L. Eryilmaz watches the deposition of a near-frictionless carbon
   coating.

   Argonne National Laboratory will host a Technology Demonstration Day
   January 29 to open a nationwide venture development competition for
   university students. The competition asks the students to develop plans
   to commercialize one of the new technologies being researched at
   Argonne. More...
   Scientists to trace 500-year current across ocean floor
   Argonne scientists can detect one argon-39 atom per 10 million billion
   atoms, the equivalent of one pint of liquid mixed in Lake Michigan.
   They will use this new capability to track a 500-year current across
   the ocean floor. More...

   Early Argonne reactor lit the way for worldwide nuclear industry
   Fifty years ago on Dec. 20, 1951, an Argonne-developed nuclear reactor
   produced useful electricity for the first time, powering a simple
   string of four light bulbs. More...
