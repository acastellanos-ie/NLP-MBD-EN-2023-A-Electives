   NCVHS 1949-1999 - A History

   The NCVHS serves as the statutory [42 U.S.C. 242k(k)] public advisory
   body to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the area of
   health data and statistics. In that capacity, the Committee provides
   advice and assistance to the Department and serves as a forum for
   interaction with interested private sector groups on a variety of key
   health data issues.

   The Committee is composed of 18 individuals from the private sector who
   have distinguished themselves in the fields of health statistics,
   electronic interchange of health care information, privacy and security
   of electronic information, population-based public health, purchasing
   or financing health care services, integrated computerized health
   information systems, health services research, consumer interests in
   health information, health data standards, epidemiology, and the
   provision of health services. Sixteen of the members are appointed by
   the Secretary of HHS for terms of four years each; with about four new
   members being appointed each year. Two additional members are selected
   by Congress.
