             Welcome to the JPL MTP Home Page!

   [NotesOff.gif] [LinksOff.gif] This web site is intended to provide a
   general background on the JPL microwave temperature profiling (MTP)
   program, which was begun in the mid-1970s. If you are not a technically
   oriented person, you might try the Introduction to MTPs link to the
   left for a general overview. Most of the other pages have to do with
   mission results, and generally are intended for scientists interested
   in these studies.

   Although MTP has been largely used to provide meteorological context
   for in situ measurements of chemical species in the atmosphere, it
   should have much broader scientific appeal, including the study of
   atmospheric transport and dynamics.

   It is hoped that this site will make visitors aware of the current
   state of the art for MTPs and some of their largely untapped potential
   applications beyond the scope of atmospheric research. These range from
   airborne clear air turbulence (CAT) and icing hazard prediction, to
   inversion layer monitoring for air quality management purposes.
