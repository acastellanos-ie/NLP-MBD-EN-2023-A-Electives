   This area of OSM's web is intended as an informational resource on AMD
   and AMD abatement.

   The phrase, Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is commonly used to refer to any
   pollutional discharge emanating from a coal mine operation. Many of
   these discharges are, in fact, alkaline; but produce high levels of
   iron or manganese pollutants.
