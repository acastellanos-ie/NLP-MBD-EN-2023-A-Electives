   These applications are in Adobe Acrobat PDF format and can be viewed,
   filled out, and printed only with Adobe's Acrobat Reader. If you do not
   have the Reader, you may download it free from Adobe Systems. Once you
   download and install the Reader, you must restart your browser in order
   to use it (so you might want to bookmark this page).

   The most current version of Acrobat Reader varies by platform: Version
   5.0 is available for Windows 95/98/ME/XP/NT/2000, and Macintosh OS 8.6
   and above. Version 4.05 is available for Macintosh OS versions 8.5 and
   below, Linux, and many other UNIX operating systems. Version 3.01 is
   available for all other platforms, including Windows 3.x and OS/2 Warp.

   If you currently have Acrobat Reader 3.0, it is advised that you
   upgrade to Version 4.05 or Version 5.0 as appropriate for your
   computer's operating system. All Versions 4.0 and above will allow you
   to fill out the form in your browser before printing. If you use
   Acrobat Reader 3.0 to view the form, you must print the form first and
   then fill it out by hand.
