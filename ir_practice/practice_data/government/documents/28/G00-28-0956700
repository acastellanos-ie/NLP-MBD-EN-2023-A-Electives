                  Wisconsin woman ordered to repay state $52,182

   The Washington State Department of Labor and Industries has ordered a
   43-year-old Wisconsin woman to repay the state $52,182 after an
   investigation showed she continued to collect workers' compensation
   widow's benefits after she remarried.

   Susan Marie Zander began collecting benefits in 1979 after her husband,
   David B. Zander, was fatally injured while working for Western Pacific
   Timber Co. in Enumclaw. She later relocated to Memphis, where in
   September 1986 she remarried. The couple divorced two-and-a-half years
   later.

   L&I learned of Zander’s marriage through an anonymous tip. Further
   investigation by the agency’s fraud unit showed that Zander hid her
   marriage in Tennessee from the department by submitting false
   information about her marital status in order to continue collecting
   widow's benefits.

   The order against Zander reflects the amount of money she collected
   illegally in workers' compensation benefits plus a 50 percent penalty.

   The ability to cross-match data with other government and private
   agencies nationwide has greatly improved the department's ability to
   track down individuals who have moved out of Washington state and are
   receiving benefits illegally.

   Labor and Industries manages the state's workers' compensation system.
   It provides coverage to more than 163,000 employers and 1.9 million
   workers. The agency is committed to eliminating fraud. Anyone who
   suspects fraudulent activity may report it anonymously online at
   www.lni.wa.gov/fraud, or by calling L&I's toll free-number,
   1-888-811-5974.
