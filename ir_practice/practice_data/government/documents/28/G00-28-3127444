                                                  Grouper in the Tortugas

   The Tortugas Ecological Reserve will protect important spawning habitat
                          for snapper and grouper.

      After years of planning, and the signature of the Florida Governor and
      cabinet on April 24th, rules designed to protect the diverse marine
      life and lush coral reefs of the Tortugas in a no-take Ecological
      Reserve take effect July 1, 2001 in the westernmost waters of the
      Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

      The Tortugas Ecological Reserve is broken into two sections. Tortugas
      North is located to the west of Dry Tortugas National Park, comprises
      90 square nautical miles of ocean habitat, and contains some of the
      most spectacular and pristine coral reefs in the Florida Keys and North
      America. Tortugas South is located to the southwest of Dry Tortugas
      National Park, comprises 60 square nautical miles of ocean and includes
      the critical spawning grounds of Rileys Hump.

      In Tortugas North, the new regulations prohibit all taking of marine
      life, restrict vessel discharges to cooling water and engine exhaust,
      prohibit anchoring and prohibit use of mooring buoys by vessels more
      than 100 feet in combined length. The regulations would allow diving
      and snorkeling, but require visitors to obtain a simple no-cost,
      phone-in permit to ensure that all vessels have access to mooring
      buoys, ease enforcement and assist in monitoring visitor impacts. To
      request a permit to visit Tortugas North, contact the Florida Keys
      National Marine Sanctuary office in Key West (305) 292-0311 or in
      Marathon (305) 743-2437.

      Regulations for Tortugas South also prohibit taking of marine life and
      restrict vessel discharges. In addition, to ease enforcement in this
      remote region, the regulations prohibit diving in Tortugas South (the
      majority of which is beyond normal recreational diving depth),
      requiring vessels to be in continuous transit through the area with
      fishing gear stowed.

      The National Park Service has been working side-by-side with NOAA and
      the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary to designate a type of
      no-take area called a Research Natural Area which would be located
      within Dry Tortugas National Park and would be compatible with the
      Tortugas Ecological Reserve. Plans for this Research Natural Area can
      be found in the revisions to the General Management Plan for Dry
      Tortugas National Park. These combined actions would result in a
      world-class no-take ecological reserve in the Tortugas.

      The Sanctuary based the Tortugas Ecological Reserve plan on a proposal
      drafted by the Tortugas 2000 working group and adopted by the Sanctuary
      Advisory Council. The 25-member working group included commercial and
      recreational fishermen, divers, scientists, conservationists,
      citizens-at-large and resource managers. The process to develop the
      reserve has drawn accolades as a model for collaborative reserve
      design.

      The Tortugas Ecological Reserve will join the Sanctuarys network of 23
      no-take areas established in 1997 (including one ecological reserve).
      The final plan is available on-line at
      http://www.fknms.nos.noaa.gov/tortugas/FinalFSEIS.pdf or by calling the
      Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (305) 743-2437.
