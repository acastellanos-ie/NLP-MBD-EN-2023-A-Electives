   Glen's Self-Portrait von

      Thanks for being the [counter.gif] th visitor since Oct. 10, 1999

  Profession: Plasma Physics

   [buttonimage1.gif] The Cerro Grande Fire in May 2000 was bad, to say
   the least. Our town was evacuated for 5 days, and more than 400
   families lost their homes. My house (in White Rock) was fine, although
   we have been clearing a lot of brush. Here are two pictures, showing
   the development of the fire on May 10..... the day the town burned.
   Early Morning, and Mid Afternoon, from Pajarito Acres looking west to
   Los Alamos.

    Alamos in 1997.

  [buttonimage1.gif] Glen Wurden participated in the "Able" atomic bomb test at
  Bikini Atoll, July 1, 1946

   On July 1, 1946, Lt. Glen James Wurden (my uncle) watched a 23-kiloton
   atomic bomb, air-dropped from a B-29 (Dave's Dream #5274), explode over
   100 ships anchored in Bikini Lagoon. Glen, a B-29 flight engineer, was
   on B-29 #577, taking pictures, 12 miles away from the blast. Click here
   to see a postcard carried on the "A-Day plane", and here for the letter
   (page 1) and page 2 which he wrote back to my Grandmother Wurden, on
   July 7, 1946. The tests were very controversial at the time. The second
   test, called "Baker", was an underwater shot, which resulted in
   extensive radioactive contamination of ships and people. Glen was
   killed in the crash of an Air Force transport plane that he was a
   passenger in, in 1949.

  [buttonimage1.gif] Space Shuttle re-enters the atmosphere over northern New
  Mexico

   The Space Shuttle Endeavor blazed across New Mexico Sky, 04:49 AM (MDT)
   May 29, 1996. The Space Shuttle was absolutely spectacular early this
   morning during its return to Earth, heading towards a landing (2Meg
   MPEG movie) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. An orange-white
   fireball, with a long plasma tail was visible early this morning
   (1-second exposure, 300 mm lens, ASA 1000 film,....excuse the shutter
   release jiggles). It was brighter than any star, and the plume
   persisted for more than two minutes. The shuttle itself was visible
   from the west-northwest over Pajarito Mountain, to the east-notheast
   over Santa Fe Baldy, from White Rock, New Mexico for about 90 seconds.

  compared to the recent Cerro Grande fire, which nearly turned the town and lab
  into Lost Almost!)

        Fast  (1000 frames/second) imaging of a single lightning bolt

    Glen likes to play with fast diagnostics. Click Here for a forward &
    backward MPEG movie of the lightning bolt sequence shown above, taken
      with a 1000 frames/second Kodak Ektapro camera using 100 microsec
   exposure on each frame. However, I usually study plasmas in a can.....
                                it is safer.

             Another lightning bolt, over Santa Fe (August 1999)


    In 1996 I helped my son Alex do a sonoluminescence science fair
   project, in our garage. Here is a picture of the light from one bubble,
   repeated compressed while held at the pressure anti-node by sound
   waves. In 1997 Alex worked on the orbit of Comet Hale-Bopp.  My friend
   Igor Gladstone took this 10 minute exposure below:

   in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Then he attended graduate
   school at Princeton University , where he earned an MS in 1979, and a
   Ph.D. in Astrophysical Sciences in 1982. He now lives and works in Los
   Alamos , New Mexico. He has researched the family roots in Germany ,
   Denmark , Norway , and Switzerland . Glen speaks German and is slowly
   learning Japanese.

  Genealogy data for Glen A. Wurden

   I have done genealogy research as a hobby on all sides of the von
   Würden family, and found ancestors back to the 1550's in Germany.
   Somewhere in Switzerland is an ancient family castle, but I have not
   been able to locate it yet. The coat of arms above, is from
   Siebmacher's Wappen book, in the 1700's, and is an old (before 1300)
   Swiss coat of arms. I have genealogy database with more than 1000
   individuals, dating back to ~1550 AD. The von Würden family had a
   family reunion in Bremerton, Washington, (near Seattle) on July 17-19,
   1998. Fifty people attended it.
