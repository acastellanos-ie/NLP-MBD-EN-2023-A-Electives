          To a large extent and for decades the documentation of the
          Holocaust and its historical context has been scattered,
          endangered, and in many cases inaccessible. The United States
          Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad VashemThe Holocaust Martrys
          and Heroes Remembrance Authority in Israel endeavor to bring
          together, to preserve, and to make more readily accessible to
          researchers the contemporary documentation relevant to this
          historical tragedy and to stimulate scholarship on its manifold
          aspects. Descriptions of their programs and holdings may be
          found at the following websites:
