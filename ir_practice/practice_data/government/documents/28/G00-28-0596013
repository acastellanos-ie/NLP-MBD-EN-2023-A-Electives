   What is COMMITS?
   In 1999, the U.S. Department of Commerce created the COMMerce
   Information Technology Solutions (COMMITS) program which is a
   government-wide acquisition contract (GWAC) that provides information
   technology services and solutions. The COMMITS program is designed to
   accomplish three objectives:
    1. Deliver top quality IT services and solutions to meet government
       organizations' missions.
    2. Deliver IT services and solutions utilizing a streamlined
       acquisition methodology.
    3. Provide a talented pool of small of small, small disadvantaged,
       8(a), and women-owned small business contractors capable of
       delivering the government's IT requirements.

   COMMITS provides federal agencies with an efficient and effective means
   of awarding IT service and solution requirements, and assists the
   federal government with acquiring essential IT requirements utilizing
   high quality performance-focused contractors. The program does this
   through the use of competitively awarded performance-based task orders.
   Under this acquisition structure, the basic contracts do not contain
   fixed contract line item numbers (CLINS) or labor categories. Instead,
   COMMITS contractors are free to propose the best solution to the
   specific requirement of each government agency.

   Unless exempted, each task order is competed under the COMMITS fair
   opportunity competitive procedure. The COMMITS fair opportunity
   competitive procedure maintains an ongoing competitive environment
   throughout the life of the COMMITS Program. Free from the constraints
   of prescribed CLINS and products, the solution-based structure
   significantly improves each contractor's ability to craft innovative
   and state-of-the-art solutions. Also, the task order award structure
   significantly reduces administrative burdens by eliminating technology
   refreshment and engineering change proposals -- which are usually
   required to keep the task order's and contractor's products and labor
   rates current, and ensures that the government receives the best value
   for the taxpayer.

   The program provides performance-based information technology services
   and solutions in three major functional areas:
     * Information Systems Engineering (ISE) Support Solutions
     * Information System Security (ISS) Support Solutions
     * Systems Operations and Maintenance (SOM) Support Solutions
