   [latimer.jpg] Four types of specialized facilities are available to
   researchers at SEPRL, providing a unique environment for study of
   highly pathogenic infectious agents. Maximum biocontainment facilities,
   allowing research in both animal and in laboratory setting, are
   maintained and utilized by technicians and scientists who must shower
   and change clothes when exiting the buildings. Staff members working in
   containment facilities for the rearing of disease-free birds must
   shower and change clothes before entering the workplace. Housed in a
   separate building at SEPRL is the South Atlantic Area Sequencing
   Facility It contains two Applied BioSystems DNA Sequence Analyzers that
   are able to rapidly characterize pathogens of poultry for diagnostic
   and research purposes. A monoclonal antibody laboratory maintained at
   SEPRL provides investigators with needed technology, equipment, and
   expertise to produce reagents specifically targeted at important
   proteins of pathogens.
