                       President's Council of Advisors
                          on Science and Technology
                                   (PCAST)

   On September 30, 2001, President Bush signed Executive Order 13226 to
   form the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology
   (PCAST). On March 28, 2001, President Bush named Floyd Kvamme PCAST's
   Co-Chair.  PCAST was originally established by President George Bush in
   1990 to enable the President to receive advice from the private sector
   and academic community on technology, scientific research priorities,
   and math and science education.

   The organization follows a tradition of Presidential advisory panels on
   science and technology dating back to Presidents Eisenhower and
   Truman.  Since its creation PCAST has been expanded and currently
   consists of 18 members from the private sector plus the Assistant to
   the President for Science and Technology who serves as the Committees
   Co-Chair.  The committee members, distinguished individuals appointed
   by the President, are drawn from industry, education, and research
   institutions, and other nongovernmental organizations.
