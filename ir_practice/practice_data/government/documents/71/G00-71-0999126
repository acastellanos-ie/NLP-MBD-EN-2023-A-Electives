   Oil Pipeline Regulation

      Under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) and the EPAct, the Commission
      regulates the rates and practices of oil pipeline companies engaged in
      interstate transportation. The objective is to establish just and
      reasonable rates to encourage maximum use of oil pipelines--a
      relatively inexpensive means of bringing oil to market--while
      protecting shippers and consumers from unjustified costs.

      The Commission does not oversee the construction of oil pipelines or
      regulate the supply and price of oil or oil products. Rather, it helps
      to assure shippers equal access to pipeline transportation, equal
      service conditions on a pipeline, and reasonable rates for moving
      petroleum and petroleum products by pipeline.
