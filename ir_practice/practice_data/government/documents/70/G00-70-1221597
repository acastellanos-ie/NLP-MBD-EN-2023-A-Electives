                                The Requirements

   ... Please Note...

   You will need the QuickTime Player to view the animations and a
   gifÂ®/jpeg image viewer to view the overlays. The quicktime player is
   available for free for Windows and Machintosh machines from Apple and
   for Unix machines from the Xanim homepage.)

   Also, the animations and some of these images are quite large and will
   take some time to download. We're still using them for our work here
   and we prefer them large. At a later date we'll probably make them
   smaller. However, you may want to check to make sure that you have both
   the quicktime movie player and a gif image viewer.

   To check whether you have quicktime, try this small (192Kb) quicktime
   movie first. If a movie comes up, you have it. On the other hand, if a
   window comes up informing you that it doesn't recognize this file type
   and asking you would you like to keep the file on your disk, then you
   don't have QuickTime and you'll have to go to Apple or Xanim to get it.

   To check whether you have a gif/jpeg viewer, try this small gif image
   (2Kb) . Again, if a picture comes up, you're set, if not, you need to
   get a gif file viewer for your machine. For UNIX users, I suggest the
   very fine XV, which is available here. (If this link causes any
   problems, just go do a Google search on XV, you'll find it easy
   enough.) If you still have problems, drop me a line. For you Window
   users, I'd be very surprised if you have any problems and I'm sorry, I
   don't know where to get a Windows gif/jpeg viewer. If someone would
   send me this information, I'd appreciate it be. And for our poor
   Machintosh bretheren...
