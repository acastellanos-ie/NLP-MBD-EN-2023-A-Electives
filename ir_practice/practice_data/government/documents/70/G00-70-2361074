   Recognizing that health issues know no geographic boundaries, the
   National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)
   throughout its 50-year history has worked with others worldwide to
   advance scientific achievements. Collaboration in research, research
   training, and health promotion has long been instrumental in moving the
   frontier of oral health forward not only nationally, but
   internationally as well. To enhance international collaboration in
   these key areas, in March of 1998 the NIDCR created an Office of
   International Health (OIH). This new office targets strategies to
   advance dental, oral, and craniofacial health worldwide.

   The OIH serves as a liaison with international agencies and foreign
   organizations involved in global oral health research. It also
   coordinates dental, oral, and craniofacial research activities under
   agreements between the U.S. and other countries, promotes strategies to
   build global oral health research capacity, and supports collaborative
   research programs and protocols in line with NIDCRs mission.
   Implementing international science exchange programs, sponsoring and
   participating in international meetings and workshops, and
   disseminating research findings throughout the world are also part of
   the offices responsibilities.
