  Ion Beam Technologies

   The design, construction, and operation of accelerators are the central
   legacies of AFRDs origins. The Ion Beam Technology Program was formed
   in 1993 to provide a focus for the Divisions activities related to the
   production and application of ion beams. Today, our work spans a
   diverse set of activities, ranging from basic research in ion source
   development and low beta acceleration to applications in materials and
   microelectronics. The integrating theme connecting these diverse
   activities is our core expertise in ion sources, ion acceleration
   systems, plasma science and associated techniques for enhancement and
   modification of materials.

   The Program has grown to include approximately 100 part- or full-time
   members, including scientists and engineers, technical and
   administrative support staff, and students. There are presently seven
   graduate students whose thesis work depends primarily or completely on
   work done in the IBT program. Two Ph.D. theses have been awarded to
   date and two more are expected this year. Much of our work is
   collaborative in nature, and we have many visitors from universities,
   other laboratories, and industry. Our activities in FY00 are supported
   by a total budget of approximately $15 million.

   These activities include lead responsibility for development and
   construction of the injection (or front end) systems for the Spallation
   Neutron Source (SNS). The SNS project is currently the largest
   non-defense construction project in the DOE. Following a difficult
   period for the project as a whole, the SNS now seems poised to move
   aggressively toward completion of the project by June 2006, with a
   partnership of six national laboratories and a total project cost (TPC)
   of $1.4 billion. As one of the partners, we are on track to deliver an
   operational and beam-tested front-end system to the SNS site at Oak
   Ridge in FY02 to meet the needs of the SNS integrated project schedule.
   Ours will be the first accelerator subsystem to be made operational at
   the SNS site.

   An important initiative that has a very high priority for the nuclear
   physics community is RIA, the Rare Isotope Accelerator. It is designed
   to provide beams of radioactive ions for studies in nuclear structure,
   nuclear astrophysics and fundamental symmetries, all strong areas of
   interest and expertise in LBNL÷s Nuclear Science Division (NSD). With
   the expectation of producing beams with half-lives of less than 1
   second, in some cases substantially less, RIA will open up a vast new
   array of experimental opportunities and is viewed as a necessary tool
   to position the US to carry out a world-leading program in nuclear
   science. This concept was developed by a national committee on which
   our program and the LBNL Nuclear Science Division, among other
   organizations, were represented.

   Medical applications of our technologies continued in 1999 with R&D
   efforts in support of proton therapy facility development and an
   accelerator-based Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) clinical
   facility. This year, our work in proton radiotherapy resulted in the
   selection of Dr. William T. Chu of IBT to receive the 2000 Federal
   Laboratory Consortium Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer. DOE
   recently conducted a comprehensive review of the national BNCT program,
   and has redirected our efforts toward a more basic research program in
   support of future accelerator-based BNCT facilities.

   Another very productive and interesting part of our work is the
   application of plasmas and low energy ion beams to materials studies
   and microelectronics manufacturing. These activities take advantage of
   techniques developed at LBNL for the production and manipulation of
   plasmas and high brightness beams, and they generate considerable
   interest from leading industrial companies. Our contributions in ion
   beam lithography will lead to improved chip design and manufacturing
   processes; the results will be higher microprocessor speed, smaller
   feature sizes, reduced power consumption, higher throughput and
   reliability, higher temperature operation, and more flexible pattern
   generation for maskless lithography. This work is supported by both
   private industry and by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
   (DARPA).

       work of the IBT Program over the past year: maskless ion-beam
       lithography, neutron-tube development, medical accelerators, the
       Spallation Neutron Source front end, and high-current
       pulsed-discharge ion sources for heavy-ion inertial fusion energy.
