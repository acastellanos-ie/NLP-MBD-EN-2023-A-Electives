   Critical Issues Forum (CIF)
   The Critical Issues Forum is designed to involve high school students
   and their teachers in issues of proliferation and control of weapons of
   mass destruction (WMD), particularly nuclear weapons. Current modules
   include a) proliferation, non-proliferation, and counter proliferation,
   b) disposition of nuclear materials, c) issues of terrorism and WMD. In
   addition, CIF provides students with comprehensive instruction and
   guidance in professional research methodologies, particularly Internet
   strategies. These methodologies include brainstorming, evaluation of
   content, synthesis of information and professional writing.

   Crystals for the Classroom
   The San Ramon Valley School District (SRVSD) and the Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory (LLNL) are working together to bring
   state-of-the-art science and technology to high school classrooms.
   Together SRVSD and LLNL have transferred crystal growing technology to
   high school classrooms that grew 500 pound crystals for changing the
   wavelength of laser light at the stadium-sized, the National Ignition
   facility (NIF) laser facility. SRVSD and LLNL will provide training and
   mentoring to enable high school teachers to be able to use this
   cutting-edge technology. Initially the workshops will focus on schools
   in the vicinity of LLNL. In subsequent years the training will be
   offered to schools throughout the United States.
   Edward Teller Education Center (ETEC)
   ETEC was founded as a K-12 collaboration between UC Davis, UC Merced,
   and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by the UC Office of the
   President (UCOP). The ETEC collaboration provides professional
   development for K-12 teachers working in participating districts within
   the greater Livermore Tri-Valley area and the San Joaquin Valley.
   Funding from the UCOP and LLNL was provided to UC Davis to establish
   ETEC on February 2, 2001. The mission of ETEC is to improve the quality
   of instruction in science and in its applications in technology by
   providing professional development opportunities for K-12 teachers.
   Specifically, these opportunities will be targeted to integrate and
   support the California subject matter standards and the teachers' needs
   as identified by teachers, school districts, and county offices of
   education. The science and technology focus uses the close proximity to
   the "world class" scientific resources available at LLNL and the
   existing professional development outreach programs currently available
   from LLNL's Science & Technology Education Program (STEP).

   Edward Teller Science & Technology Symposium
   The Edward Teller Science and Technology Symposium provides a bridge to
   link the science classroom with the research laboratory. We are
   providing secondary and community college science educators the
   opportunity to explore ongoing research at the LLNL in physics,
   chemistry, biology and environmental science. Participants will tour
   state-of-the-art research laboratories, talk with researchers about
   their work, and attend "hands-on" workshops to learn new activities
   they can use in the classroom. The lessons and activities will be
   directly linked to the California Science Education Standards.

   Fun with Science
   Scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory travel to your
   school site to conduct interactive science presentations and
   demonstrations in chemistry, physical sciences, and environmental
   sciences. The presenter engages students in discussions about
   scientific and technological concepts, while asking questions and
   providing interactive, hands-on experiments to enhance learning and
   scientific thinking skills. Fun With Science presents to students and
   teachers at K-8 grade levels. The presentations are educational and
   enjoyable and students learn that Science is Fun!

   Future Scientists and Engineers of America (FSEA)
   FSEA has been in existence for 7 years and is based in southern
   California. It is a national non-profit organization which provides the
   structure, project material, documentation and workshop training
   necessary to establish after-school technology clubs. The program is
   structured around scientists mentoring a classroom of students (grades
   4 through 12) on a project chosen by the scientist.

   Laser Science and Optics in the Classroom (LSOC)
   The Laser Science and Optics for the Classroom program is a high school
   component initializing a School-to-Career path leading to careers in
   laser science and optics. Teachers participating in LSOC receive
   materials and lessons to help them integrate laser and optics
   technology into high school science and mathematics curricula. LSOC
   lessons are activity-based, giving students hands-on experience using
   lasers and optics equipment.

   Parent - Student Opportunities in Optics Education
   Opportunities in Optics Education is a two-event program which will
   provide parents, students and educators with the information needed to
   start a student on a optics engineering pathway through Las Positas
   College leading to guaranteed admission to UC Davis in their junior
   year. Students who successfully complete this program will earn a BS
   degree in Optics Engineering from UC Davis. This is a new program that
   begins at Las Positas College in Fall Semester of 2000.
   Promoting Achievement Through Hands-On Science (PATHS)
   PATHS is a partnerships between LLNL and UC Merced at the San Joaquin
   County Office of Education to benefit students and teachers in the
   Central Valley and Livermore Tri-Valley communities. Teachers are
   trained in the Lawrence Hall of Science Great Explorations in Math and
   Science (GEMS) and students interact with scientists from LLNL through
   related science demonstrations with LLNL's Fun With Science program.
   Student Research Academy
   The Student Reseacrh Academy shows students and their teachers learn
   how to conduct research. They study with LLNL researchers and teachers
   already experienced in guiding student research. The academy provides
   the student and their teacher with an opportunity to develop an
   appropriate research question, conduct the literature search and
   develop a research plan with appropriate experimentation. Under the
   direction of their teachers, these students complete their research
   investigation during the school year. During the winter these students
   return to LLNL to present their work in a student research symposium.

   Computer Technology Workshops for Educators
   Computer Technology Workshops for Educators provide instruction to K-14
   teachers in Internet technology offered by the Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory's Science & Technology Education Program in
   collaboration with the Edward Teller Education Center. These workshops
   are designed by teachers for teachers. Our instructors can answer your
   questions and help you master the Internet as a tool for teaching.
   Review the schedule of the summer workshops and register online.

   Tri-Valley Science and Engineering Fair (TVSEF)
   TVSEF is a science project competition for students grades 7-12 from
   public schools within the areas of Danville, Dublin, Livermore,
   Pleasanton, San Ramon, and Sunol. The fair is affiliated with the Intel
   International Science and Engineering Fair.
