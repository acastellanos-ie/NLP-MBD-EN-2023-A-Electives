      Press Releases

                           See the Bay Area Census site

      For Immediate Release

   Regional data available
   Bay Area Census Web Site Announced

      OAKLAND, Calif., April 6, 2001...The Metropolitan Transportation
      Commission (MTC) and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
      have teamed up to host a customized Web site that provides Census 2000
      data about the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area as a whole, as well
      as by individual cities and counties.
      The MTC/ABAG Web site -- accessible at http://census.abag.ca.gov -- has
      aggregated the data for easy use by those interested specifically in
      the Bay Area, unlike other census Web sites (such as the Census
      Bureauís American FactFinder, http://factfinder.census.gov), which
      present figures for the region piecemeal. In addition, the MTC/ABAG
      site offers tables comparing 1980 and 1990 census figures to 2000
      census numbers for the nine counties.
      The March 29 release of Census 2000 data for California is just one of
      many releases scheduled to occur over the next few years, and covers
      figures for total population, population age 18 years and over, and
      race -- in each case with details down to the censusí smallest
      geographical level: the city block.
      Since the 2000 census allows respondents to identify themselves by as
      many races as may apply, tabulation of race has become a complicated
      exercise. The initial data show the totals and combinations of six race
      categories -- White, Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska
      Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and Other -- as well
      as the ethnic category of Hispanic/Non-Hispanic. Later data releases
      will include a breakdown of the "Asian" designation into subsets such
      as Laotian, Vietnamese and the like, as well as racial categories for
      the regionís residents who are of Hispanic origin. Other data due out
      this summer will add information about age, sex, household and housing
      characteristics. Data regarding travel patterns are expected to become
      available by fall of 2002.
      MTC is the transportation planning, financing and coordinating agency
      for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.
      For further information about Bay Area census data, e-mail or call the
      MTC-ABAG Library at library@mtc.ca.gov or 510.464.7836.
