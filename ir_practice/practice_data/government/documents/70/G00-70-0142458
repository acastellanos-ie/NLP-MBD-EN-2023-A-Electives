   Becoming a Neutral: Training, Qualifications and Application Process
   The Mediation training sessions scheduled for January, February and
       March of 2002 have been postponed until later this year. We will
       post the rescheduled dates of these sessions at least two months in
       advance. In the meantime, the ADR Program will continue to accept
       and review new applications from potential mediators. We do not
       have any ENE or Arbitration trainings scheduled at this time, but
       you may submit an application for consideration for future
       trainings. Click here for an Application
       The court strongly prefers that applicants and existing neutrals
       use the Online Neutral Profile. If you are unable to use that form,
       you may download either a Microsoft Word or Corel Word Perfect
       formatted form from the icons on the left hand side of this page or
       obtain a hard copy by contacting the ADR Unit.
       The court will consider applicants with expertise in all federal
       case subject areas, but has especially strong needs for neutrals
       located in the South Bay and North Bay or with expertise in the
       following areas of law: Police Conduct, Employment, ADA Access,
       Intellectual Property, Insurance and ERISA. The court welcomes
       applications from all qualified individuals, including women,
       people of color, gays and lesbians, and others who are members of
       groups who traditionally have been under-represented in the legal
       profession.
       Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE) Description
       In Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE) the parties and their counsel, in
       a confidential session, make compact presentations of their claims
       and defenses, including key evidence as developed at that juncture,
       and receive a non-binding evaluation by an experienced neutral
       lawyer with subject matter expertise. The Evaluator also helps
       identify areas of agreement, offers case-planning suggestions and,
       if requested by the parties, settlement assistance. For more
       information, see ADR Local Rule 5.
       ENE Evaluator Requirements

     * admitted to the practice of law for at least 15 years
     * a member of the bar of the Court or of the faculty of an accredited
       law school
     * considerable experience with civil litigation in federal court
     * expertise in the subject matter of the case
     * temperament and training to listen well, facilitate communication
       and assist with settlement discussions

   Mediation Description
   Mediation is a flexible, non-binding, confidential process in which a
   neutral person facilitates settlement negotiations. The Mediator
   improves communications across party lines, helps parties articulate
   their interests and understand those of their opponent, probes the
   strengths and weaknesses of each party's legal positions, identifies
   areas of agreement and helps generate options for a mutually agreeable
   resolution to the dispute. The Mediator generally does not give an
   overall evaluation of the case. A hallmark of mediation is its capacity
   to expand traditional settlement discussion and broaden resolution
   options, often by exploring litigant needs and interests that may be
   formally independent of the legal issues in controversy. For more
   information, see ADR Local Rule 6.
   Mediator Requirements
     * admitted to the practice of law for at least 7 years and member of
       the bar of the Court or of the faculty of an accredited law school,
       or if a non-lawyer, an appropriate professional credential in
       another field (such as accounting)
     * knowledgeable about civil litigation in federal court
     * strong mediation process skills and the ability to listen well,
       facilitate communication and assist with settlement discussions
     * experience in transactional work is desirable, but not required

   Payment of Evaluators and Mediators
   Service as an ENE Evaluator or Mediator is primarily pro bono.
   Evaluators and Mediators volunteer their preparation time and the first
   four hours of a session. After four session hours, the Evaluator or
   Mediator may charge the parties $200 per hour. After four more hours,
   if all parties agree, the Evaluator or Mediator may charge any rate to
   which all parties agree. In special circumstances for complex cases
   requiring substantial preparation time, the parties and the Evaluator
   or Mediator may make other payment arrangements with the approval of
   the ADR Director or ADR Program Counsel.
   Minimum Participation Requirement for
   Evaluators and Mediators
   Evaluators and Mediators must be willing to serve in at least three
   cases per year under these programs.
   Arbitration
   The court is not currently offering Arbitration training, but we will
   retain any applications for consideration when we conduct our next
   training.
   Arbitration Description
   Arbitration is an adjudicative process in which an arbitrator or a
   panel of three arbitrators issues a non-binding judgment ("award") on
   the merits after an expedited, adversarial hearing. Either party may
   reject the non-binding award and request a trial de novo. An
   arbitration occurs earlier in the life of a case than a trial and is
   less formal and less expensive. Because testimony is taken under oath
   and is subject to cross-examination, arbitration can be especially
   useful in cases that turn on credibility of witnesses. Arbitrators do
   not facilitate settlement discussions. For more information, see ADR
   Local Rule 4.
   Arbitrator Qualifications
     * admitted to the practice of law for at least 10 years
     * member of the bar of the Court or of the faculty of an accredited
       law school
     * either: for not less than five years, committed 50% or more of
       their professional time to matters involving litigation, or
       substantial experience serving as a neutral in dispute resolution
       proceedings

   Payment of Arbitrators
   The court pays single arbitrators $250 per day and pays member of
   three-arbitrator panels $150 per day, pursuant to statute.
