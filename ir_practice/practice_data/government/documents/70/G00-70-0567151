   On this day in weather history...
   In 1997, a Tsunami struck Hawaii. Eight people who were taking pictures
   of it, were swept into the ocean by a gigantic wave. Unfortunately 4 of
   them drowned. In 1988, strong southerly winds that gusted to 53 mph in
   Kansas City, spread record warmth into the central plains. Nineteen
   cities set record high temperatures. Meanwhile strong northwest winds
   ushered cold arctic air into the central states. At Cutbank Montana,
   the temperature fell from 54 degrees, to a morning low of 7 degrees
   below zero.
