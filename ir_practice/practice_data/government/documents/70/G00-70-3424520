                                  overview
    Food and agricultural systems operate in a highly competitive global
   context, and the United States is a major player in these international
     marketsthe U.S. share of the global market for agricultural goods
     averages just under 20 percent. Since U.S. farms produce far beyond
   domestic demand for many crops, maintaining a competitive agricultural
        system is critical to ensuring the economic viability of U.S.
    agriculture. At the same time, U.S. agriculture is a diverse economic
       sector. Differences in commodity type, farm size, operator and
      household characteristics, and even goals for farming affect the
    competitiveness of individual operations and ultimately of the sector
                                 as a whole.

     In recent years, changes in the rules of trade, shifts in domestic
   policy, and new developments in technology have altered the competitive
     landscape of global agriculture and the challenges facing American
      farmers. ERS research focuses on these and other economic issues
      affecting the U.S. food and agriculture sector's competitiveness,
        including factors related to performance, structure, risk and
    uncertainty, marketing, and market and nonmarket trade barriers. More

   USDA's recently released Food and Agricultural Policy--Taking Stock for
        the New Century, recognizes that the success of the Nation's
      agriculture and food system is the result of farsighted planning,
    investment, and policy decisions. Taking a long-term view, USDA sets
   out principles for equipping the food and agriculture sector to operate
    in a modern business environment that is globally integrated, highly
    competitive, technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious,
       and which must respond to increasingly sophisticated consumers.

   Agricultural Outlook, ERS's premier monthly magazine, contains articles
       on topics covering commodity markets and outlook, trade, policy
     developments, and more. Tables in the magazine include data on farm
     income; farm balance sheets; commodity supply, demand, and prices;
   program details; and other items related to the competitiveness of U.S.
                                agriculture.

                            recommended readings
   What factors underly shifts in global food consumption patterns and the
    composition of world agricultural trade? Changing Structure of Global
   Food Consumption and Trade explores the effects of higher incomes, diet
   diversification, increasing demand for higher quality and labor-saving
         products, and other factors on food consumption and trade.
       Analysis of the U.S. Commodity Loan Program with Marketing Loan
    Provisions shows that the availability of marketing loan benefits to
    supplement producer revenues when crop prices are relatively low can
     influence planting decisions and acreage allocation and thus affect
                                crop prices.

   Agricultural trade barriers and producer subsidies inflict real costs,
      both on the countries that use these policies and on their trade
     partners. Among other findings, The Road Ahead: Agricultural Policy
     Reform in the WTOSummary Report indicates that eliminating global
   agricultural policy distortions would result in an annual world welfare
    gain of $56 billion. Also see the related report, Profiles of Tariffs
                       in Global Agricultural Markets.

                          recommended data products
   Feed Grains Data Delivery System is a queriable database allowing users
      to search appendix tables of the Feed Outlook report for data on
     acreage, production, supply, and use of corn and other feed grains.

    Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States (FATUS) provides U.S.
     agricultural exports and imports, volume and value, by country, by
   commodity, and by calendar year, fiscal year, and monthly, for varying
    periods, such as 1935 to the present or 1989 to the present. Derived
       State export value data are also available. Updated monthly or
                                  annually.

        Production, Supply, and Distribution (PS&D) database provides
    projections for the coming year and historical annual marketing year
     data for more than 200 countries and regions, covering production,
      supply, use, and trade of 62 commodities. The database is updated
     monthly or biannually, and generally begins with the marketing year
                                  1960/61.

   Farm Income provides farm income forecasts, updated regularly, and farm
    income estimates, released once a year. Forecasts are developed using
    an economic accounting model that generates forecasts of value-added
        and farm income, plus component accounts of cash receipts and
    production expenditures, for the national farm sector. Estimates are
      derived from survey data gathered by USDA's National Agricultural
     Statistics Service (NASS) and other national institutions over the
                             course of the year.

                        recent research developments
    As U.S. agriculture becomes more market-oriented, rates of return on
   farm sector investments are increasingly sensitive to global supply and
     demand shifts, as well as to structural changes between and within
     production regions. The regionalization of U.S. agriculture project
   identifies key factors driving differences in rates of return earned by
   farm assets across regions and over time, and examines how economic and
      structural change affects the profitability of farm investments.

     Regional trade agreements have become a fixture in the global trade
   arena. To better understand the economics of regional integration, the
     ERS research program is analyzing the movement toward an integrated
     North American market for some commodities, particularly grains and
      livestock products. A forthcoming report will assess the economic
    significance of a more unified agricultural market in the three NAFTA
     economies and implications for U.S. agricultural and rural economic
                     activity. Contact: Steven Zahniser

                                 newsletters
         ERS analysts develop monthly commodity reports highlighting
      developments in the markets for cotton and wool, feed grains, oil
           crops, wheat, rice, and livestock, dairy, and poultry.
