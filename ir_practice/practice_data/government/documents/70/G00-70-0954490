                  Cotton Ginning: From Seed Cotton to Lint
     __________________________________________________________________

   Role of the Cotton Gin
   The role of the cotton gin has changed dramatically in the last 50
   years to keep up with technological and production changes in the
   cotton industry. At one time, the gin's only function was to remove
   cottonseed from the fiber. Today, gins must not only separate the seed
   from the fiber, they must also dry and clean the fiber and package it
   into bales before it reaches the textile mill.
   All gins differ in some aspects of the ginning process. In the
   Southwest, for instance, gins are equipped with both saw and roller
   gins: saw gins for ginning Upland cottons, and roller gins for ginning
   Pima cotton, a cotton grown almost exclusively in this region of the
   Cotton Belt. Elsewhere in the Cotton Belt, gins use only saw gins in
   their operation.

   The Ginning Process
   Stage I: Seed Cotton Conditioning and Cleaning:
   Seed cotton - seeds with fiber still attached-usually arrives at the
   gin in large trailers or modules used for hauling it from the field and
   for storing it until ready for ginning. From the storage area, conveyor
   pipes transfer it to the various stages of the ginning process using
   large volumes of air to make the flow of the cotton easier and faster.
   Typically, seed cotton is first dried in large driers using heated air
   to reduce its moisture content. A cylinder cleaner then removes the
   leaves and other small trash from the seed cotton by shaking it with
   spiked cylinders, while conveying it across a screen with small
   openings that sift the trash released from the seed cotton by the
   impact action of the cylinders.
   Next, a stick machine removes any large sticks or hulls (the dried
   bolls that form a shell around cotton as it grows) with revolving
   channel saws. These saws grab the seed cotton and whip it over metal
   bars to sling off its trash. If the seed cotton requires additional
   drying and cleaning, gins will often run it through another drier and
   another cylinder cleaner and stick machine.
   Mechanical harvesters made seed cotton drying and cleaning necessary.
   Although much faster than hand harvesting, mechanical harvesters also
   pick more trash with the cotton, which usually contains a high amount
   of moisture. Trash, as well as moisture, can adversely affect the
   quality of the fiber and lead to costly operating and processing
   expenses at the gin and at the textile mill.
   Excess moisture is common to cotton grown in the more humid regions of
   the Cotton Belt, while cottons produced in the Southwest can be too dry
   because of the region's arid climate. Lack of moisture at ginning can
   also lower the quality of the fiber and contribute to ginning problems.
   To prevent fiber damage and to facilitate ginning, gins try to balance
   the moisture content in the seed cotton during drying, so that it is
   neither too wet nor too dry. With unusually dry cottons, gins will skip
   the drying stage and will, at times, add moisture to it with a special
   humidifier that blows warm, humid air through the gin's conveyor pipes.

   Stage II: Ginning the Seed Cotton.
   The seed cotton is now ready for ginning. Pima cotton is conveyed to
   the roller gin, while upland cottons are conveyed to the saw gin for
   separation of seed and fiber. After being ginned, the cotton fiber is
   often referred to as lint.
   Stage III: Lint Cleaning.
   Lint cleaners remove the small trash from the ginned lint left behind
   by the cylinder cleaner and stick machines. Saw-lint cleaners grab the
   lint with a cylinder saw and whip it over metal bars to dislodge its
   trash. Lint cleaning of roller ginned cotton usually involves a
   combination of three machines: a cylinder cleaner, an impact cleaner
   which uses cylinders to agitate and release the trash from the lint,
   and an air-jet cleaner which removes the trash from the lint using high
   velocity air.
   Stage IV: Packaging the Lint.
   In the final stage, a bale press compresses the ginned lint into bales
   that weigh between 450 and 500 pounds. The bales are then wrapped with
   a protective covering, ready for delivery to the warehouse where they
   are sold to the various textile mills.
