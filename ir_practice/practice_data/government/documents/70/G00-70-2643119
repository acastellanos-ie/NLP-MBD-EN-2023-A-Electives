   T-4 is the atomic and optical theory group in the Theoretical Division
   at Los Alamos National Laboratory. T-4 staff, postdocs, students, and
   associates develop methods for and perform calculations of atomic
   structure, scattering cross sections, opacities, exotic atoms, and
   quantum and nonlinear optics, including effects of high energy density
   environments and interaction with external electromagnetic fields.
   Current efforts include the evaluation of opacities for a wide range of
   physical conditions, nonequilibrium kinetics, quantum molecular
   dynamics simulations of dense plasmas and shocked hydrocarbons,
   hohlraum spectroscopy, plasma sources of XUV radiation, strong-field
   ionization and scattering, harmonic frequency conversion of laser
   light, electromagnetic wave propagation, adaptive optics, coherence and
   chaos in ion traps, quantum computing, and Bose-Einstein and possible
   Fermion condensates of cold atoms. The Group maintains an interactive
   web site for user calculations of opacities of mixtures.
