   Strategic Planning & Policy

      The Department of Transportation invests more than $2.5 billion
      annually in information technology to improve safety and increase the
      mobility of American citizens. The Strategic Planning and Policy
      Division of the Office of the CIO ensures that this large information
      technology program supports the strategic goals and objectives of the
      Department as outlined in the DOT Strategic Plan 2000-2005 and 2001
      Performance Plan. Equally compelling are opportunities to streamline
      and improve how citizens interact with the Department as required by
      law. This division provides leadership and establishes policy to
      address these many regulatory requirements including accessibility to
      information and systems by individuals with disabilities, reducing
      paperwork burden on the public and protecting their privacy when
      citizens do business electronically with the Department.
