                     Orgasm may be right-brain activity

   By Amy Norton

   NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters Health) - The unusual case of one woman with
   epilepsy has led researchers to conclude that the right side of the
   brain is probably home to the orgasm command center.

   After a 31-year-old Hungarian epilepsy patient told her doctors that
   she experienced orgasm-like feelings just before she had a seizure,
   they decided to look into the phenomenon further. The doctors were able
   to uncover 22 cases of this so-called "orgasmic aura" preceding
   epileptic seizure reported in the medical literature since 1945.

   Nine of these patients had sufficient brain-activity records for the
   researchers to zero in on the orgasmic brain spot. And it appears to be
   somewhere in the right, or typically "non-dominant," side of the
   brain--possibly in a region called the amygdala, which is involved in
   emotional response.

   Dr. Jozsef Janszky and colleagues at the National Institute of
   Psychiatry and Neurology in Budapest report their findings in the
   January issue of Neurology.

   Janszky told Reuters Health that he decided to look into the prevalence
   of orgasmic aura in epilepsy because until his patient reported it, he
   had never heard of such a case.

   "It is not a routine question in everyday epileptology practice," he
   noted.

   In fact, Janszky said, his patient had kept the orgasmic experiences to
   herself for 10 years before telling her doctors.

   The researchers believe the brain area behind orgasmic aura also
   underlies sexual orgasm. If so, Janszky said, further study into the
   chemical features of the structures involved could lead to a greater
   understanding of how orgasm arises.

   "As orgasm is one of the most important things in human life," he
   added. "I think (studying) its central mechanisms is interesting."
