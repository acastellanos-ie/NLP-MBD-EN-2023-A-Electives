   Consumer Roundtable. Ongoing dialogue between Agency officials and
   consumers on consumer protection priorities.

   Surfing the Web Wisely: The Food and Drug Administration encourages
   consumers to consult with a health-care professional before ordering
   prescription medications from Internet sites. The use of these products
   without the involvement of a learned intermediary significantly
   increases the risk of serious and life-threatening adverse events.
   These risks include dangerous drug interactions and the possible ill
   effects of impure or unknown ingredients found in unapproved drugs. For
   more information see Buying Medical Products Online.
