  INTRODUCTION

   The International Nuclear Safety Center (INSC) at Argonne National
   Laboratory conducts projects to maintain and improve safety at nuclear
   power plants. The INSC develops enhanced nuclear safety technology and
   promotes the open exchange of nuclear safety information among nations
   through collaborative scientific research activities between the U.S.
   and its international partners.

   INSC projects strengthen United States national security by improving
   the safety of nuclear power in the former Soviet Union. For the newly
   emerging nations of Eastern Europe, these projects protect public
   health, and stabilize political, economic, and environmental conditions
   by establishing a safe supply of electrical power. For the United
   States, these projects promote lasting, successful international
   relations by sharing beneficial nuclear power safety technology and
   improving living standards.

   INSC projects are supported by the Office of International Nuclear
   Safety (NN-30) within the National Nuclear Security Administration
   (NNSA). The NNSA, together with the United States Department of Energy
   (USDOE), conducts national and international energy and security
   programs.

   The attacks by terrorists in New York and Washington, D.C., on
   September 11, 2001, focused public attention on the potential for
   vulnerabilities at nuclear power stations, both in the U.S. and
   internationally. In particular, the possibility of a large scale
   nuclear accident and release of radioactive materials following an
   impact of a commercial airliner at a nuclear power reactor has caused
   public concern. The following comments are intended to inform the
   public about the safety design features of U.S. nuclear power plants,
   their performance in design-basis accident conditions, routine
   requirements to protect against sabotage, and additional measures taken
   since September 11.

  U.S. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SAFETY DESIGN

   In the United States, nuclear power plant design, construction, and
   operation are regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission (NRC) an agency of the Federal government. The NRC follows
   legal requirements established by the Executive and Legislative
   branches of the Federal government, codified as Title 10 of the Code of
   Federal Regulations. The owner of each nuclear power plant built in the
   United States must apply to the NRC for construction and operation
   licenses. Before obtaining these licenses, the plant owner must prove
   that the plant will be built and operated according to the regulations
   set by Federal law. During operation, the NRC continues to monitor the
   plant operator's compliance with legal requirements that protect public
   health and safety.

   Every system in each U.S. nuclear power plant that is important for
   protection of the public health and safety is designed according to the
   defense-in-depth philosophy. The basic tenant of the defense-in-depth
   principle is that for every safety-related function, there are multiple
   barriers or engineered systems. Furthermore, each of these systems is
   diverse and redundant. "Redundant" means that for every safety-related
   function there are two or more systems, each of which is fully capable
   of performing the required function if one system fails. "Diverse"
   means that each of the systems is independent and uniquely designed so
   that no single failure initiator can cause failure of all the systems
   dedicated to a particular function.

   An example of the defense-in-depth principle is the fuel containment
   function. Within the reactor, the fuel is in the form of cylindrical
   ceramic pellets, stacked one on top of another and enclosed inside a
   metal tube called the cladding. The cladding is designed to be fully
   capable of containing the fuel and fission products for the entire life
   of the fuel; it is the first containment barrier. A large, thick-walled
   (several inches) steel vessel is used to hold the reactor and its
   coolant. The reactor vessel is the second containment barrier. Finally,
   the large building containing the reactor and other equipment is made
   from a steel shell backed with several feet of reinforced concrete. The
   containment building is the third containment barrier. The
   defense-in-depth principle is applied to every safety-related system in
   a nuclear power plant, from cooling to control, from shutdown to
   containment.

  SAFETY DESIGN PERFORMANCE

   Prior to construction, the design of each safety-related system is
   analyzed using conservative methods and assumptions. The analysis
   results must show that the design is capable of performing according to
   the requirements of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as
   interpreted and enforced by the NRC. After construction, prior to start
   up, and at specified periods during operation, safety-related systems
   are inspected and tested to assure that they can perform their intended
   function.

   The effectiveness of the defense-in-depth philosophy was demonstrated
   in 1979 during the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power
   plant. In this accident, as a result of multiple equipment failures and
   operator errors, the fuel overheated and the cladding failed. However,
   the containment function was preserved and maintained by the reactor
   vessel, which remained intact and held the reactor core debris. The
   containment building also remained intact and functional, and would
   have protected the public even if the reactor vessel had failed. The
   Three Mile Island accident demonstrated the validity of the
   defense-in-depth design philosophy, and showed that even for the most
   disastrous accident conditions, the health and safety of the U.S.
   public will be protected.

  PROTECTION AGAINST SABOTAGE

   Prior to September 11, all operations at U.S. nuclear power plants were
   carried out in compliance with requirements then, and now, in place to
   protect against sabotage. Plant perimeters are fenced and plant grounds
   are patrolled by armed guards. Mock attacks by trained intruders are
   conducted under NRC supervision to test protection procedures and
   identify necessary enhancements. Prospective plant workers are
   subjected to background checks and testing prior to employment. On the
   job, plant employees are monitored continuously. Since September 11,
   security and plant protection procedures have been intensified with
   additional security personnel and physical barriers at plant entrances.
   In cooperation with local, state, and Federal authorities, operators at
   U.S. nuclear power plants are now working at the highest level of
   alert, ever vigilant and ready to act to stop anyone who would try to
   sabotage their plants.

  WHAT HAPPENS IF AN AIRLINER HITS A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT?

   Although U.S. nuclear power plants are not specifically designed to be
   impervious to impact by a modern commercial jet airliner, the
   containment buildings at U. S. nuclear power plants are among the most
   massively constructed structures ever built, and would provide
   significant protection in the event of a terrorist attack like those on
   September 11. Because of the defense-in-depth design philosophy and the
   multiple barriers and safety systems, operators at U.S. nuclear power
   plants can bring even the most severe accident sequences to a halt
   before there is a significant release of radioactivity, and minimize
   the risk of injury to the public.

   Each day, everyone engages in activities that have some risk, such as
   riding in a car, eating in a restaurant, or getting a sunburn. U.S.
   nuclear power plants are designed and operated so that the risk to
   public health and safety from nuclear power is much, much less than the
   risk from other, everyday activities. No one can guarantee that nuclear
   power, or any other normal activity, is 100% free of risk. But nuclear
   power in the United States is less risky than the normal activities we
   perform every day.

   power industry to protect the public from attacks by terrorists, you

   Commission and the Nuclear Energy Institute.
