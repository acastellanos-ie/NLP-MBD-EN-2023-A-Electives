                            Victims Services Unit

   The Victims Services Unit provides coordinated services to institution
   and parole staff, victims, local victim assistance agencies, the
   judicial system and nationally recognized victims groups. The program
   is based on the Youth Authority's policy that the justice system is
   accountable to victims and has a responsibility to implement programs
   which will address the long-term impact of crime on victims.

   The Victims Services Unit is aware of and sensitive to the plight of
   victims of crime and provides assistance to them by:
    1. Advocating for victims, i.e., legislation, representation
    2. Providing direct services to victims, i.e., notification and
       restitution collection
    3. Training staff regarding victims' legal rights and sensitivity to
       victims' issues
    4. Holding offenders accountable for their behavior
    5. Educating offenders to the impact of crime on victims

   The Department designated its first Victims Services Specialist in
   1983. Since that time, efforts to establish and coordinate statewide
   victims programs have proven fruitful and are recognized state and
   nationwide. The Victims Services Unit has implemented a variety of
   victim oriented models where offenders are held accountable, crime is
   personalized and victims can be heard.

   The Victims Services Unit currently provides services to approximately
   13,584 victims and their 10,424 offenders (as of May 7, 1998). Services
   include phone counseling, information and referral, dissemination of
   allowable offender information, notification of anticipated parole
   board hearings, allocution rights (voicing the impact of the crime) to
   the Youthful Offender Parole Board, assistance in understanding the
   juvenile justice systems' process and procedures, and disbursement of
   restitution collected on behalf of victims.

   In addition, the Victims Services Unit provides technical assistance to
   CYA staff, Victim- Witness Assistance Centers personnel, the judiciary,
   the Board of Control, and county probation departments.

   The Unit takes pride in the development of literature and brochures
   useful to not only victims, but also correctional personnel and victims
   advocacy groups. Literature includes three technical bulletins,
   Stalking, Family Violence Prevention and Death Notification. The
   Victims Services Unit has also developed an informational brochure for
   crime victims whose offenders are under the jurisdiction of the Youth
   Authority. The brochure is available on the Internet by clicking He Got
   CYA or for the Spanish version, Lo Mandaron al CYA.


   Victim-Offender Meetings

   In an effort to provide continued direct services to victims, the
   Department has developed the policy and procedure requirements
   necessary for safe and effective victim-offender meetings.
   Standardization of procedure from site to site, development of strict
   criteria for selecting suitable candidates, and measures for evaluating
   successful interactions are all part of the program's goals. To review
   program criteria and eligibility requirements, please click on
   Victim-Offender Meetings Report.


   Impact of Crime on Victims

   Impact of Crime on Victims classes began in 1984 at the Youth Training
   School. Purposes of the program were to (1) expose youthful offenders
   to the long-range harm they cause their victims; (2) to hold offenders
   accountable for their actions; and (3) to teach offenders better ways
   to handle conflict and violence.

   Currently, all institutions and camps offer Impact classes. Thousands
   of wards have now completed the course. The course includes 35 to 60
   hours of experiential curriculum over a period of six to twelve weeks.
   Speakers are an essential component and are often actual crime victims
   or victim service providers such as representatives from MADD, Parents
   of Murdered Children, rape crisis and domestic violence centers, and
   victim witness programs.

   Approximately 100 Youth Authority staff and guests received training in
   victim services and conducting Impact of Crime on Victims classes every
   year.

   National Victims Week

   Every year, the nation commemorates National Crime Victims Rights Week.
   While the origins of such an observance are tragic, the end result of
   early efforts in the crime victims rights field, have resulted in great
   strides in obtaining rights, services and understanding for the trauma
   of crime victimization. The California Youth Authority takes pride in
   its observance of this celebration of hope and survival and plans a
   variety of events at virtually all of its sites across the state. The
   Victims Services Unit coordinates and disseminates support materials
   and information to all site coordinators in an effort to enhance
   activities and publicize the efforts of staff throughout the state.


                            Our Pledge to Victims

   As Youth Authority staff, we pledge the following:
     * To uphold a victim's right to be protected from further physical
       and emotional harm.
     * To treat victims in a professional, sensitive and supportive
       manner.
     * To consider victims' needs and value their input.
     * On a daily basis, hold offenders accountable for past and current
       victimization of others.
