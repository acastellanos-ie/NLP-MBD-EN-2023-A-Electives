                       NASA Website Privacy Statement
     __________________________________________________________________

   This policy establishes how NASA will use information we gather about
   you from your visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of
   utmost importance to NASA.

   If you visit a NASA site:

   To read or download information:
          We may collect and store information for statistical purposes.
          For example, we may count the number of visitors to the
          different sections of our site to help us make them more useful
          to visitors. Similar information is gathered for anonymous ftp,
          remote account login, or for other comparable types of
          connections.

   To send us an E-mail:
          By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be sending us
          personal information (e.g., name, address, E-mail address), as
          in an official Freedom of Information Act request. We may store
          the name and address of the requester in order to respond to the
          request or to otherwise resolve the subject matter of your
          E-mail.

   To register:
          Some of our sites ask visitors who request specific information
          to fill out a registration form. For example, vendors looking
          for marketing opportunities by visiting our Electronic Grants or
          NASA Acquisition Internet Service sites may be asked to
          "register" to obtain copies of Requests for Proposals or other
          NASA opportunities. Other information which may be collected at
          these sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other
          means, enable us to determine a visitor's interests, with the
          goal of providing better service to our customers.

   We want to be very clear: Regardless of the information being
   transmitted to NASA, we will protect all such information consistent
   with applicable law.
