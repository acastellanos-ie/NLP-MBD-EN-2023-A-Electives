Ohio District's Microbiology Program

   The microbiology program in the Ohio District has been steadily growing
   over the past ten years. Projects have evolved from monitoring of
   fecal-indicator bacteria in surface waters to studies that investigate
   the processes and factors that affect bacteria, viral, and protozoan
   pathogens and indicators in the environment.

   Analyses for fecal bacteria are done by field personnel and guidance on
   these methods can be provided by the Ohio District. In addition, the
   Ohio District Microbiology Laboratory has the capability of analyzing
   samples for coliphage, enteric viruses, and Clostridium perfringens.

     A Workshop on Water Quality Issues in Public Health Microbiology was
     held March 14-16, 2000, in Columbus, Ohio.  See Summary and Selected
     Presentations.
