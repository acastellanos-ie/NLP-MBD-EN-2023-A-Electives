   The Comprehensive Plan and Town Code are the two major documents
   governing the Town of Blacksburg.

  The Comprehensive Plan

   The Comprehensive Plan is a general guide for the future of Blacksburg.
   It is an opportunity for the citizens and government officials to
   anticipate and plan for the community's future. In Virginia,
   comprehensive plans have their legal basis in the Code of Virginia. The
   Code requires that every governing body adopt a comprehensive plan and
   that it be reviewed at least once every five years. The Town's current
   comprehensive plan was adopted in 1996 and is available in its entirety
   here. The Town is currently working on a comprehensive plan update
   which will be completed in 2001. The Final Draft of the 2001 Blacksburg
   Comprehensive Plan is now available for public comment.

  The Town Code

   The Blacksburg Town Code includes all of the local ordinances enacted
   and enforced by the Town of Blacksburg. The Code includes the Town
   Charter which is granted by the Virginia General Assembly, the general
   Code of Ordinances, and two appendices, the Zoning Ordinance and the
   Subdivision Ordinance. The ordinances in the Town Code are enacted and
   enforced by the Town Council. The Blacksburg Town Code is provided here
   (best viewed in frames). The on-line version of the Town Code is hosted
   on the site of the Municipal Code Corporation.
