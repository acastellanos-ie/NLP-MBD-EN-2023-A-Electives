   About CIA

   Welcome to the CIA Museum

      Housed in the Agency's Headquarters Building in McLean, Virginia, this
      unique collection illustrates the history of US intelligencewhich
      effectively began when this country was still 13 separate coloniesby
      showing some of the artifacts and tools used by men and women serving
      in various aspects of espionage.

      The North Gallery houses the Agency's permanent collection of artifacts
      and photographs from the early days of the CIA to the present. [PHOTO
      OF ESTREET SEAL]   Of special interest is the relationship between the
      World War II-era Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the present-day
      Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  Personal effects reflecting the
      career of Maj. Gen. William J. Donovan, as well as numerous examples of
      OSS tradecraft (much of which was used by CIA after it was established
      by President Truman in 1947) underscore the historical and
      philosophical link joining the two organizations. So strong is this
      connection that General Donovan is considered the Father of CIA despite
      the fact he never actually served as the Agency's director.

      The Cold War Gallery features hundreds of rare Soviet and Stasi
      espionage artifacts from the private collection of H. Keith Melton,
      author of "The Ultimate Spy Book."  In addition to cameras, listening
      devices, and concealment devices, several "spy stories" and a Cold War
      timeline are presented.
