   DSRC
     * On December 12, 2000 the ITS Joint Program Office issued a
       Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) on Dedicated
       Short Range Communication (DSRC). This NPRM responded to the
       comments filed in the initial NPRM proposing to make a new DSRC
       specification a requirement for all Commercial Vehicle Operations
       projects that use Highway Trust Funds.
       The Supplemental NPRM delays the issuing of a final rule until the
       testing of the new specification has been completed. The test
       program is expected to begin in the summer of 2001 and be complete
       at the end of that year.
