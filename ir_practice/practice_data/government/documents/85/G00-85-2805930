                                 Who We Are

      The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the federal
      government agency that works hand-in-hand with people to conserve
   natural resources on private land.  Using our scientific and technical
   expertise, and our partnerships with Conservation Districts and others,
    we help conserve and enhance all natural resources on private lands.

                                 Our Mission

   To provide leadership in a partnership effort to help people conserve,
         improve and sustain our natural resources and environment.

                                 Our Vision

                     Harmony Between People and the Land
