Amargosa Desert Research Site

   In 1976, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) began studies of unsaturated
   zone hydrology at a site in the Amargosa Desert near Beatty, Nevada, as
   part of the USGS Low-Level Radioactive Waste Program. [adrs_photo1.jpg]
   Over the years, USGS investigations at the Amargosa Desert Research
   Site (ADRS) have provided long-term benchmark information about the
   hydraulic characteristics and soil-water movement for both natural-site
   conditions and simulated waste-site conditions in an arid environment.
   In 1995, as a result of finding elevated concentrations of tritium and
   carbon-14 in the unsaturated zone beneath the ADRS, the scope of
   research was broadened to include the study of processes affecting
   transport of contaminants through the unsaturated zone. The ADRS was
   incorporated into the USGS Toxic Substances Hydrology Program in 1997.
   Research at the site is a multidisciplinary, collaborative effort that
   presently involves scientists from the USGS, universities, research
   institutes, and national laboratories.
