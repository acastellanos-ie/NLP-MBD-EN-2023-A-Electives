        Man Pleads Guilty in eBay Fraud Case


MARY JO WHITE, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of
 New York, announced today that RODGI INCIONG pled guilty yesterday in
   Manhattan federal court to charges of defrauding customers of the
        Internet auction services eBay Inc. and Yahoo Auctions.
In his plea INCIONG admitted that in the Fall of 2000, he posted bogus
   offers to sell computers, video cameras, and other merchandise in
online auctions held on eBay and Yahoo Auctions. INCIONG admitted that
 he obtained payment for the items through money orders and the online
 payment service PayPal, but never intended to deliver the merchandise
    as promised to the purchasers. According to a previously-filed
 Complaint, INCIONG defrauded at least 30 victims, in amounts totaling
                        approximately $50,000.
    United States District Court Judge GEORGE B. DANIELS scheduled
 INCIONGs sentencing for March 13, 2002. The charge to which he pled
   guilty carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and the
 greater of a $250,000 fine or twice the gross gain or loss resulting
                            from the crime.
 Ms. WHITE praised the investigative efforts of the Federal Bureau of
                Investigations Internet Fraud Squad.
    Assistant United States Attorney MEIR FEDER is in charge of the
                             prosecution.
