   Thruster Fault Detection for the X38

   OBJECTIVES:
   Increase the safety, accuracy and efficiency of navigation control for
   the X38/CRV :

   The Smart Systems Research Lab at NASA Ames Research Center is
   developing advanced fault detection technologies for the X38/CRV, in
   collaboration with NASA Johnson Space Center (Code EG - Aeroscience and
   Flight Mechanics Division). This effort focuses on identifying in near
   real-time single/multiple hard thruster failure, thruster leaks, and
   vehicle mass property. This work also includes adaptive reconfiguration
   control based on the identified thrusters and mass property for a class
   of future spacecrafts.

   For the X38 vehicle, thruster failures are difficult to detect because
   of the limited sensor capabilities. For the CRV, mass property is
   difficult to determine accurately as the number of crew members can
   vary, and the payload brought onboard varies as well. The approach
   being applied is to use advanced identification technologies and
   adaptive neural control to provide optimal control of the spacecraft.
   This approach does not require a mathematical model of the spacecraft a
   priori but instead it effectively learns an accurate model of the
   spacecraft from its behavior. The controller uses gathered data from a
   set of navigational sensors to quasi-statically learn an accurate model
   of the spacecraft performance. In this manner, the controller can
   control the spacecraft under a variety of changing conditions such as
   varying mass, changing center-of-mass location, thruster degradations,
   failures, and leaks. Optimization methodologies are then used to
   achieve optimal performance.
