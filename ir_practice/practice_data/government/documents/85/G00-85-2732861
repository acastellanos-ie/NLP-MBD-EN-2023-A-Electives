   Digital Maps


        * BARD -- USGS's San Francisco Bay Area Regional Database
          BARD makes it convenient to acquire FREE USGS digital map data of
          the Bay Area.
          BARD offers 4 different data types that can be accessed directly
          from the Web site:

        * Digital Line Graphs (DLGs)
        * Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)
        * Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs)
        * Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs)

      Descriptions of these data types, what the data can be used for, and
      specific download instructions are all included on this Web site.

        PG&E and USGS
      Spectacular satellite imagery of the San Francisco Bay Area

      [PG&E and USGS satellite image of south SF Bay] "Cooperative Research &
      Development between Pacific Gas & Electric Company and the USGS to
      promote informed decisions about reducing Earthquake Risks in the San
      Francisco Bay Area."

      Portfolio of images of landscape, seascape and faults of the San
      Francisco Bay area

      These images drape Landsat TM satellite imagery over Digital Elevation
      Models to show the bay as it has never been seen before. Earthquake
      fault lines are displayed in red.

      All the images can be downloaded quickly for printing from your home
      computer on US Letter paper. Full size 6ft images can be downloaded or
      ordered from this site, or you can take a file to any good copy service
      bureau that offers a poster printing service.

        USGS Western Region Geologic Mapping Team's
      San Francisco Bay Region Project

      [Sample geologic map] Project members specialize in geologic mapping,
      landslide hazards analysis, geophysics, terrain modeling and analysis,
      paleontology, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

      Through an understanding of the complex geology of the San Francisco
      Bay region, the Project seeks to assess geologic hazards such as
      landslides, earthquake-causing fault zones, and soil liquefaction due
      to ground shaking.

      Visit the USGS San Francisco Bay Region Project's Web site to learn
      about and navigate through these topics:
        * Geologic Mapping
        * Landslides
        * 3-D modeling
        * Terrain modeling
        * Paleontology
        * Geophysics

        Coastal and Marine
      Remote Sensing Research and Applications

      [Compressed DEM plus shaded relief image of the Peninsula] Presented at
      this web site are image products and information generated using remote
      sensing in several projects designed to study coastal and marine
      environments.

      Remotely sensed data help scientists and researchers in a variety of
      projects, including those dealing with:
        * seafloor mapping and temporal change detection,
        * finding new resources, and
        * learning more about our nation's coastal and marine habitats.

      Image products on this web site include:
        * regional DEM and bathymetry images of Central California
        * wetland restoration monitoring in Sonoma Baylands
        * change detection and mapping in SF Bay
        * multibeam backscatter and bathymetry mosaics
        * seafloor map of the Monterey Bay region

      and many more!
