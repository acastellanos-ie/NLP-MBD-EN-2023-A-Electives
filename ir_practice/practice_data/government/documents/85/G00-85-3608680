   UI Applications
   Printer Friendly Version

   You have a choice of two applications available on-line to use when
   filing a UI claim. The first application is interactive and completed
   on-line. If you are unable to use the interactive form, an alternate
   form is available to be printed and completed by hand. After
   completion, each must be mailed or faxed to EDD. Please read the
   descriptions below for information on the applications, then click on
   your choice and follow the instructions carefully.

    1. eApply4UI is completed on-line. This application has many Help
       features to assist you. When you have answered all the questions, a
       summary of your application will display. You then print this
       summary and fax or mail it to EDD.

    2. UI Application, DE 1101I, is printed, then completed by hand. You
       must mail or fax the entire completed application to EDD. You may
       be routed to this application if your browser is not compatible
       with eApply4UI.

   Please indicate if you are out of work as a result of the economic
   impact of the September 11, 2001 disaster when you explain why you are
   no longer working. For more information please see Unemployed Airline
   Industry Workers.

   Effective January 2002, California's maximum weekly amount increases to
   $330. Claims filed prior to January 2002, have a maximum weekly amount
   of $230. For more information, please see When to File - December 2001
   or January 2002.

   Employers:

   Employers may want to print copies of the UI Application, DE 1101I, and
   the instructions as a service to their employees. This application is
   also available for any other organization to provide to their clients.

   Note: The DE 1101I is subject to change. To get the most current
   version, print just before use.

   If you prefer to file your claim by telephone, call one of EDD's
   toll-free numbers and a customer representative will assist you.
