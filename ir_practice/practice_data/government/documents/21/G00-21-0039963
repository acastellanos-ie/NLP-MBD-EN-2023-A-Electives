NEWSLETTERS

   ORI has produced a quarterly newsletter since 1993 to nurture the
   partnership that has been developed between research institutions and
   the PHS to pursue a common interest in handling allegations of
   misconduct and promoting integrity in PHS supported research. The first
   newsletter appeared in January 1993, but has been published on a March,
   June, September, December schedule ever since. The newsletter is sent
   to all PHS and other federal research agencies, to all institutions
   that have an active research misconduct assurance with ORI, and to
   individuals upon request. Newsletters are available here in HTML or PDF
   or WordPerfect formats.
