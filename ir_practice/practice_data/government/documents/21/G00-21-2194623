   their breeding colonies (Año Nuevo State Reserve and Piedras Blancas
   beach) in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary; the number of
   newly-born pups peaks shortly after.

December

   Look for the blows of gray whales migrating south through the Gulf of
   the Farallones Sanctuary and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary
   in December and January. Pregnant females come first, swimming along
   the coastline and are visible from shore as they head for the warm
   waters of the Gulf of Mexico for calving and mating.

   Northern elephant seals arrive at their breeding colonies (Año Nuevo
   State Reserve and Piedras Blancas beach) in the Monterey Bay National
   Marine Sanctuary. Two-ton adult bulls arrive first and fight among
   themselves for dominant positions; as pregnant females come on shore,
   they join harems of the highest-ranking bulls. The female population
   peaks around January 24; the number of pups peaks shortly after. By
   mid-march most of the adult females and males have returned to sea,
   leaving the pups behind to fend for themselves. By late April most of
   the weaned pups have gone to sea to begin feeding.

   Winter water fowl migrate through, 100,000's of ducks and geese rest
   and feed in the lagoons and estuaries in the Gulf of the Farallones
   Sanctuary and northern portion of the Monterey Bay Sanctuary.
