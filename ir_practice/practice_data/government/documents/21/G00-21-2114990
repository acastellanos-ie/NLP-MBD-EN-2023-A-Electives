                            Disaster Preparedness


   Between 1993 and 1998 there were at least nine major disasters in the
   State of California, including three major floods, three fires, two
   winter storms, and one major earthquake. Insuch disasters, the first
   priorities for the use of state resources is the protection of life,
   property, and the environment. In the past, this has not included a
   coordinated response for the evacuation, care, and sheltering of
   animals. Although the protection of human life is appropriately the
   highest priority in disasters, recent disaster experiences and
   follow-up research has shown that proper preparation and effective
   coordination of animal issues will enhance the ability of emergency
   personnel to protect citizens and their property.

   The CDFA has developed a County Animal Disaster Preparedness and
   Response Planning Guide to be used by counties to develop their own
   plan for dealing with animal issues during disaster. It is much more
   efficient, effective, and inexpensive to develop plans to address
   animal issues prior to an incident than during one. The risks of not
   having a plan include the refusal of animal owners to evacuate, early
   return of animal owners to unsafe areas, large animals spreading
   disease and becoming a danger to people in the area, animal carcasses,
   and economic loss. By developing an animal disaster plan, counties can
   prepare animal owners for disasters and organize resources before the
   disaster.
