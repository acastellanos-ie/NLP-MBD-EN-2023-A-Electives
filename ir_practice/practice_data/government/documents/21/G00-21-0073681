   A large boulder of vesicular basalt can be found along the shore at
   Ahjumawi SP. It has been pitted with scores of small cupules -- thought
   to be a result of ancient religious practices. The exact function and
   date of these pits has been lost to time. People have lived in what is
   now California for over 12,000 years.  This long occupation resulted in
   the creation of tens of thousands of archaeological sites, representing
   villages, hunting, gathering and fishing areas, religious and cermonial
   locations, trails and rock art sites, to mention just a few.  The rapid
   pace of development in California has resulted in the damage or
   destruction of many of these sites, although thousands of others are
   being protected in California state parks.

   Some of the recent projects dealing with prehistoric archaeological
   sites in the California State Parks System are discussed in the
   following web pages.
