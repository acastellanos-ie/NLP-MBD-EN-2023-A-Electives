   NREL has facilities at four sites. In Golden, Colorado, we have
   administrative offices in the Denver West Office Park. The Visitors
   Center and major research facilities are also in Golden, located across
   I-70 from Denver West at the South Table Mountain Site. Our National
   Wind Technology Center is a separate facility located between Golden
   and Boulder. We also maintain an office in Washington, D.C. Photo of
