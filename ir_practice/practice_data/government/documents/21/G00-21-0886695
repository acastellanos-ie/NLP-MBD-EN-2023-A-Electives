   Ongoing activities of the NMFS Restoration Center based in the
   Narragansett Laboratory include the finalization of the Restoration
   Plan and Environmental Assessment for the January 19, 1996 North Cape
   Oil Spill, monitoring of restoration projects, and GIS based support
   for restoration projects such as New Bedford Harbor Restoration sites

   The Restoration Plan and Environmental Assessment for the January 19,
   1996 North Cape Oil Spill assesses the environmental impact caused by
   the North Cape oil spill and outlines several restoration projects
   designed to compensate for injuries to natural resources and natural
   resource services.

     North Cape Oil Spill                                       Sampling at Sach
uest

   North Cape Oil Spill Sampling at Sachuest

   Monitoring of restoration projects funded by the World Prodigy Oil
   Spill include vegetation and ground water surveys of Sachuest Salt
   Marsh in Middletown RI.

   Additionally, research is currently underway to compare the diet of
   mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) from restored and natural portions
   of Sachuest Salt Marsh.The flora and fauna of  Eelgrass beds planted in
   Narragansett Bay were recently surveyed by Narragansett and Beaufort
   personnel.

   Restoration Center personnel in the Narragansett Laboratory have also
   participated in fish surveys at Argilla Road Salt Marsh in Ipswich
   MA.This is a community based restoration project that restored the
   normal tidal flushing regime to a marsh previously restricted by an
   undersized culvert.
