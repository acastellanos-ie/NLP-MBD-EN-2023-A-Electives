   E-Government

      At the Department of Transportation, E-Government means the use of
      digital technologies to transform government operations in order to
      improve effectiveness, efficiency, and service delivery.

      The Office of the CIO E-Government Division is responsible for
      monitoring and reporting on Departmental progress in complying with the
      requirements of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, which
      requires government agencies to automate their interactions with
      outside partners and customers by October 21, 2003 to the extent
      practicable.
      Our office provides leadership and guidance throughout the DOT to
      facilitate the transition to digital government primarily with our work
      with designated "E-Government Liaisons" from the Department's operating
      administrations.

      Another role of our office is to manage the Department's involvement in
      government-wide
      E-Government initiatives. A current example is the President's
      Management Council's On-Line Rulemaking e-government initiative in
      which the DOT plays a leading role.

      Finally, we develop and promulgate web policy and guidance for the
      entire Department, while the individual DOT organizations are
      responsible for the implementation of this policy in the managing of
      their web sites.

      Here are a few examples of our more notable E-Government success
      stories:
        * Do-It-Yourself web site makes it easy to make on-line payments
          using your credit card
        * Docket Management System lets the public review and comment on
          items on the docket
        * Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration web site provides
          real-time, up-to-date information contained in their Licensing &
          Insurance database; and the
        * National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has put recall
          information at your fingertips!
        * Our DOT intranet site "DOTnet" has recently received the
          prestigious Jakob Nielsen award as one of the top intranets.

      Do you have a suggestion on how DOT can expand the use of E-Government
      to better serve the public? Let us know!
