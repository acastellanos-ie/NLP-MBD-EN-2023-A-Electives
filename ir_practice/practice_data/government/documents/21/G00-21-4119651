   USAID Assistance  for the Philippines
   __________________________________________________________________

   USAID assists Philippine partners in four areas:
    1. Economic reform and governance
    2. Conflict resolution in Mindanao
    3. Family planning, maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS and infectious
       diseases
    4. Environmental governance and energy

   USAID/Philippines also responds to humanitarian emergencies such as
   natural disasters.

    ECONOMIC REFORM AND GOVERNANCE

   Purpose:
   Improve prospects for combating corruption, attracting investment and
   resuming poverty reduction

   Corruption mitigation: Institutions, Policies and Practices Made
   Transparent and Accountable.
   USAID is assisting in improving efficiency, transparency and
   accountability of institutions in the management of the enabling
   environment for investment. Ongoing and planned activities include:
     * Strengthening management at the Bureau of Internal Revenue

     * Modernizing import valuation and other operations at the Bureau of
   Customs, consistent with the WTO agreement

     * Reform of corrupt practices in the stock market through
   strengthening of the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission

     * Improving transparency and efficiency of government procurement

     * Strengthening and enforcement of commercial law through the
   Department of Justice and the courts

     * Improving transparency and accountability of banking institutions
   and addressing money laundering issues

   Corruption Mitigation: Competitive Barriers to Development of
   Infrastructure and Trade Removed.
   USAID is helping to level the playing field and make government
   regulations more transparent and accountable. This will allow for
   expanded and efficient private and public investment, full
   participation in the multilateral trade system, and expanded job
   creation.
     * USAID is providing assistance to improve the competition and
   regulatory framework for ports, shipping, aviation, power, roads,
   information and communication technology, and grains marketing.
   Support for these initiatives also includes assistance for public
   information for constituency building, engagement of civil society
   and local governments for advocacy and monitoring, the legal
   framework for policy reforms, and the judiciary for enforcement.

     * USAID is helping to implement activities under the WTO framework
   for grains sector reform, biotechnology, customs valuation,
   intellectual property rights, plant variety protection, and
   sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Support for these initiatives
   also includes assistance for public information for constituency
   building, engagement of civil society and local governments for
   advocacy and monitoring, the legal framework for policy reforms,
   and the judiciary for enforcement.

   MINDANAO

   Purpose:
   Accelerate the economic transformation of the Philippines' poorest
   region, Mindanao, and support the Peace Process.

   Trade and Investment Growth.
   Through its Growth with Equity in Mindanao (GEM) Program, USAID is
   carrying out a wide range of activities aimed at accelerating economic
   growth on Mindanao and ensuring that as many of Mindanao's 18 million
   people as possible benefit from the economic growth. GEM's current
   areas of emphasis are helping establish or strengthen business support
   organizations that provide advocacy and other services for Mindanao's
   key business sectors; bringing about the sound introduction or
   widespread expansion of production and marketing of a number of
   agricultural or aquacultural commodities that offer particular promise
   for Mindanao; and addressing the problems that threaten the long term
   viability of Mindanao's fishing industry.

   Strengthening Peace in Mindanao.
   Through its Livelihood Enhancement and Peace (LEAP) Program, (and
   LEAP's predecessor programs), USAID has assisted some 13,000 former
   MNLF combatants to become commercial level producers of corn, rice, or
   seaweed. We anticipate assisting up to an additional 10,000 former
   combatants through LEAP. USAID will also be strengthening governance in
   Muslim areas of Mindanao through decentralization and anti-corruption
   programs.

   Microfinance.
   USAID is working with large numbers of Rural Banks and credit
   cooperatives in Mindanao to assist those institutions to develop the
   capability to profitably serve the microenterprise market.

   HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING

   Purpose:
   Reduce fertility rate and improve maternal and child health, and
   prevent the rapid increase of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.

   Family Planning in the Public Sector.
   GOP health facilities provide contraceptives and counseling to 70% of
   the family planning users in the country. USAID assistance improves the
   quality and reach of services provided by GOP health facilities.
   Working with the DOH and local governments, USAID supports the Matching
   Grants Program and the Sentrong Sigla Movement to improve client access
   to quality family planning services at the rural health units and the
   barangay health stations nationwide.

   Private Sector Promotion.
   The role of the private sector in the delivery of family planning
   services has remained virtually untapped. USAID is helping expand
   private sector participation in family planning promotion and service
   delivery. USAID supports the FriendlyCare Foundation and the
   Well-Family Midwife Network of clinics providing affordable quality
   primary health care and family planning services to the working poor.

   Contraceptive Interdependence Initiative.
   Towards a sustainable supply of contraceptives, USAID will work with
   the DOH, the private sector and other donors to determine the best
   strategy for ensuring contraceptive security in the Philippines. This
   effort is critical given data from the 2000 census, which counted the
   population at 76.5 million and reported that the annual population
   growth rate has increased from 2.32 percent in 1995 to 2.36 percent in
   2000.

   Advocacy and Behavior Change.
   A strong health care service delivery program, including family
   planning, requires a strong enabling environment. USAID is taking the
   lead in advocacy and policy formulation and implementation that will
   lead to greater access to and better acceptance of family planning and
   maternal and child health services.

   Infectious Diseases and HIV/AIDS.
   The Philippines has one of the highest prevalence rates of TB in the
   world. USAID is carrying out an infectious disease program to control
   the incidence of TB, as well as dengue and malaria. USAID is also
   combating the growing complacency regarding the threat of HIV/AIDS by
   supporting the monitoring of HIV/AIDS cases and education efforts to
   groups at highest risk of contracting the disease.

   ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY

   Purpose: Sustainable use of natural resources and improved
   environmental management.

   Environmental Governance.
   USAID is addressing critical threats to biologically and economically
   important coastal and forest resources through improved policies,
   training with follow-on technical support and environmental advocacy.
   Activities are promoting transparency and accountability in awarding
   leases and contracts, in collecting and spending fees, and the
   enforcement of laws governing sustained use of natural resources.
     * Coastal resources management. USAID is building the institutional
   capability to reduce over fishing and destructive fishing
   practices.

     * Forest resources management. USAID is strengthening local
   capability to reduce illegal logging and conversion of natural
   forests.

     * Solid waste management. USAID is strengthening the capability of
   local government units to segregate, recycle and compost waste.

     * Hazardous waste management. USAID is promoting technologies for the
   safe handling, storage and disposal of toxic wastes, including
   environmental management systems to reduce industrial pollution.

   Energy.
   USAID is reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions from the
   energy and transportation sectors by improving policies, strengthening
   regulatory capabilities, promoting private sector participation, and
   building public support for new initiatives.
     * Restructuring and privatization. USAID is supporting the
   restructuring of the energy sector in order to encourage
   competition in generating and distributing energy, and in
   privatizing government-owned energy assets.

     * Vehicle emissions. USAID is encouraging the active participation of
   important stakeholders in the design and implementation of a
   nationwide vehicle safety inspection and emissions testing system.

     * Renewable energy. USAID is building the capability of the private
   sector to electrify rural areas with renewable energy and to
   encourage local communities in planning and carrying out activities
   to help ensure the sustainability of renewable energy investments.

   Communication strategy.
   USAID is helping our partners and civil society strengthen their
   ability to advocate for improved policies dealing with restructuring
   the power sector, reducing vehicle emissions and promoting renewable
   energy.
