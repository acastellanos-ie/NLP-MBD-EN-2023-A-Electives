   Security Tips for Air Travelers

   Before You Leave

      When you are preparing for your trip, remember to pack smart pack safe.
      You cannot bring the
      items listed below on your person or in carry-on luggage.



   Knives of any length, composition, or description.



   All cutting and puncturing instruments. This includes pocketknives,
   carpet knives and box cutters,
   ice picks, straight razors, metal scissors, and metal nail files.



   Corkscrews.



   Athletic equipment that could be used as a weapon, such as
   baseball/softball bats, golf clubs,
   pool cues, ski poles, and hockey sticks.



   Fireworks - signal flares, sparklers, or other explosives.



   Flammable liquids or solids - fuel, paints, lighter refills, matches.



   Household items - drain cleaners and solvents.



   Pressure containers - spray cans, butane fuel, scuba tanks, propane
   tanks, CO2 cartridges, and self-inflating rafts.



   Weapons - firearms, ammunition, gunpowder, mace, tear gas, or pepper
   spray.



   Other hazardous materials: dry ice, gasoline-powered tools, wet-cell
   batteries, camping equipment with fuel, radioactive materials (except
   limited quantities), poisons, and infectious substances.



   Beware - many common items used everyday in the home or workplace may
   seem harmless, however, when transported by air, they can be very
   dangerous. In flight, variations in temperature and pressure can cause
   items to leak, generate toxic fumes or start a fire.



   Personal care items containing hazardous materials (e.g., flammable
   perfume, aerosols) totaling no more than 70 ounces may be carried on
   board. Contents of each container may not exceed 16 fluid ounces.



   Matches and lighters may only be carried on your person. However,
   "strike-anywhere" matches, lighters with flammable liquid reservoirs,
   and lighter fluid are forbidden.



   Firearms and ammunition may not be carried by a passenger on an
   aircraft. However, unloaded firearms may be transported in checked
   baggage if declared to the agent at check in and packed in a suitable
   container. Handguns must be in a locked container. Boxed small arms
   ammunition for personal use may be transported in checked luggage.
   Amounts may vary depending on the airline.



   Dry ice (4 pounds or less) for packing perishables, may be carried on
   board an aircraft provided the package is vented.



   Electric wheelchairs must be transported in accordance with airline
   requirements. The battery may need to be disconnected, removed, and the
   terminals insulated to prevent short circuits.



   Leave gifts unwrapped. Airline security personnel will open gifts if
   the X-ray scan cannot
   determine the contents.

     If in doubt, don't pack it.

Allow Extra Time



   Arrive early. Heightened airport security measures increase the time
   needed to
   check in. Arriving at the airport two hours before your flights
   scheduled departure is
   advisable, however, passengers may want to consult with their airline
   for more
   specific arrival times. Build in even more time at the airport if
   traveling with young children,
   infants, or persons with disabilities.



   Consider taking public transportation to the airport, if possible.
   Parking and curbside
   access will be controlled and limited.



   Curbside check-in is available only at specific locations. Contact your
   airline to see if it is
   available for your flight.



   Do not leave your car unattended in front of the terminal. Security
   measures dictate that unattended cars will be towed.

At the Airport



   Watch your bags and personal belongings at all times.



   Do not accept packages from strangers.



   If you see unattended bags or packages anywhere in the airport terminal
   or parking
   area, immediately report them to a security officer or other authority.



   Report any suspicious activities or individuals in the airport or
   parking lot to airport security.



   Don't joke about having a bomb or firearm. Don't discuss terrorism,
   weapons, explosives, or other threats while going through the security
   checkpoint. The mere mention of words such as "gun," "bomb," etc., can
   compel security personnel to detain and question you. They are trained
   to consider these comments as real threats.

Checking In



    Adult passengers must bring a government-issued photo ID. The FAA
   requires that air
   carriers request government-issued identification, such as a drivers
   license or draft card, if
   the passenger appears old enough to have an ID. If a government-issued
   photo ID is not
   available, bring two pieces of ID, one of which must be from a
   governmental authority.



   E-ticket travelers should check with their airline to make sure they
   have proper
   documentation.



   Automated kiosks are available for airlines that have appropriate
   security measures in
   place. Travelers interested in this option should check with their
   airlines.



   Be prepared to answer questions about your bags. When asked who packed
   your bags and
   if you might have left them unattended at anytime, think carefully and
   answer the questions
   honestly. Criminals may use unsuspecting passengers to carry bombs or
   other dangerous
   items onto aircraft.



   Be cooperative as screeners ask to hand-search your bags. Security
   personnel will search a bag if the x-ray scan cannot determine its
   contents.

Screener Checkpoints



   Only ticketed passengers are allowed beyond the screener checkpoints,
   unless a passenger
   requires parental oversight or must be accompanied by a medical
   assistant.



   Travelers are limited to one carry-on bag and one personal item (e.g.,
   purse or briefcase).



   Electronic items, such as laptop computers and cell phones, may be
   subjected to
   additional screening. Be prepared to remove your laptop from its travel
   case so it
   can be X-rayed separately.

On the Airplane



   Listen carefully to the flight attendants safety instructions. Note
   where the closest exit to
   your seat is located.



   Wear your seat belt.



   Report unattended items to your flight attendant.
