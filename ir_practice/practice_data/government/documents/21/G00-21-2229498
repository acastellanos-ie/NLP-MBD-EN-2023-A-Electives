                      NTIA Public Safety Program Office

         Welcome to the NTIA Public Safety Program Office Home Page

   On August 13, 1996, NTIA's Spectrum Management Division announced the
   formation of a new Public Safety Program Office. The Public Safety
   Program was established to coordinate the various spectrum and
   telecommunications related activities and programs within the Federal
   Government as it relates to public safety. William Speights, a
   recognized leader in the land mobile radio and public safety
   telecommunications fields, was named to head the Program.

   [bullet.gif] NTIA has published Special Publication 01-48, Alternative
   Frequencies for Use by Public Safety Systems, its report as part of a
   joint submission to the Congress by NTIA and the Federal Communications
   Commission regarding alternative frequencies for use by state and local
   public safety agencies.

   [bullet.gif] Press Release: NTIA announces plans to designate certain
   federally allocated radio frequencies for use by law enforcement and
   incident response entities to improve communications during emergencies
   and help them to better respond to threats to public safety.

Current Activities

   Current activities of the Program include:

   [bullet.gif] PSWAC Follow-on Effort

   A follow-on effort to the PSWAC, chartered as the National Public
   Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) was proposed by Secretary
   Irving at the last PSWAC meeting. This effort will be designed to
   provide a continuing flow of information between Public Safety Agencies
   (FLEWUG, APCO, PSCC, and others) and the regulators (NTIA and the FCC)
   as recommendations of the PSWAC are evaluated and implemented.

   The Federal Law Enforcement Wireless Users Group (FLEWUG) and the
   Public Safety Wireless Network (PSWN) Program Management Office
   together embody the Federal (and eventually the State/local) vision of
   the future of public safety wireless communications. The long-range
   goals of these organizations include a national plan for seamless,
   ubiquitous communications for all public safety agencies. NTIA has and
   will play an integral role in the planning and development of this
   vision.

   [bullet.gif] Project 25, Project 34 and Federal/International Standards

   NTIA has participated in Project 25 from its inception in 1989 and will
   continue to provide leadership under the Public Safety Program. This
   program also maintains a LISTSERV for Project 25 participants, serves
   on the Federal Telecommunications Standards Committee-Land Mobile
   Subcommittee, and will participate in Project 34.

   [bullet.gif] National and International Public Safety Coordination

   The Program will provide a Federal Government focal point for other
   National and International Public Safety Programs, including regional
   interoperability efforts between Federal/State/local, international
   agreements and coordination, national and international training, and
   public safety technologies.

Grants

   Public Safety agencies are encouraged to apply for a grant through
   NTIA's Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance
   Program (TIIAP). TIIAP is a highly-competitive, merit-based grant
   program, that provides seed money for innovative, practical projects
   that extend the benefits of advanced telecommunications and information
   technology to rural and urban underserved Americans. Since its
   inception in 1994, the information infrastructure grant program has
   awarded more than $79 million in matching grant funds to non-profit
   organizations, such as schools, libraries, hospitals, public safety
   entities, and state and local governments. Click here to learn more
   about TIIAP and how to apply for a grant.
