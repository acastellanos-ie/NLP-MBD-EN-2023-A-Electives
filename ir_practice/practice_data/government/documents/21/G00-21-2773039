   Transportation
                      [top66.gif]

   Airline Fares
    1. You may lower the price of a round trip air fare by as much as
       two-thirds by making certain your trip includes a Saturday evening
       stay over, and by purchasing the ticket in advance.
    2. To make certain you have a cheap fare, even if you use a travel
       agent, contact all the airlines that fly where you want to go and
       ask what the lowest fare to your destination is.
    3. Be flexible, if possible. Consider using low fare carriers or
       alternative airports and keep an eye out for fare wars.

     * Web Resource: http://www.dot.gov/airconsumer/bestfare.htm

   Car Rental
    1. Since car rental rates can vary greatly, shop around for the best
       basic rates. Ask about any additional charges (extra driver, gas,
       drop-off fees) and special offers.
    2. Rental car companies offer various insurance and waiver options.
       Check with your automobile insurance agent and credit card company
       in advance to avoid duplicating any coverage you may already have.

     * Web Resource: http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/autos/carrent.htm

   New Cars
    1. You can save thousands of dollars over the lifetime of a car by
       selecting a model that combines a low purchase price with low
       financing, insurance, gasoline, maintenance, and repair costs. Ask
       your local librarian for new car guides that contain this
       information.
    2. Having selected a model, you can save hundreds of dollars by
       comparison shopping. Call at least five dealers for price quotes
       and let each know that you are calling others.
    3. Remember there is no "cooling off" period on new car sales. Once
       you have signed a contract, you are obligated to buy the car.

     * Web Resource: http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/autos/newcar.htm

   Used Cars
    1. Before buying any used car:
          + Compare the seller's asking price with the average retail
            price in a "bluebook" or other guide to car prices found at
            many libraries, banks, and credit unions.
          + Have a mechanic you trust check the car, especially if the car
            is sold "as is."
    2. Consider purchasing a used car from an individual you know and
       trust. They are more likely than other sellers to charge a lower
       price and point out any problems with the car.

     * Web Resource: http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/autos/usedcar.htm

   Auto Leasing
    1. Don't decide to lease a car just because the payments are lower
       than on a traditional auto loan. The leasing payments may be lower
       because you don't own the car at the end of the lease.
    2. Leasing a car is very complicated. When shopping, consider the
       price of the car (known as the capitalized cost), your trade-in
       allowance, any down payment, monthly payments, various fees (excess
       mileage, excess "wear and tear," end-of- lease), and the cost of
       buying the car at the end of the lease. Keys to Vehicle Leasing: A
       Consumer Guide, published by the Federal Reserve Board and Federal
       Trade Commission, is a valuable source of information about auto
       leasing.

     * Web Resource: http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/leasing

   Gasoline
    1. You can save hundreds of dollars a year by comparing prices at
       different stations, pumping gas yourself, and using the
       lowest-octane called for in your owner's manual.
    2. You can save up to $100 a year on gas by keeping your engine tuned
       and your tires inflated to their proper pressure.

     * Web Resource: http://www.fueleconomy.gov

   Car Repairs
    1. Consumers lose billions of dollars each year on unneeded or poorly
       done car repairs. The most important step that you can take to save
       money on these repairs is to find a skilled, honest mechanic.
       Before you need repairs, look for a mechanic who:

     * is certified and well established;
     * has done good work for someone you know; and
     * communicates well about repair options and costs.

     * Web Resource: http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/autos/autorpr.htm

   Insurance
                 [top66.gif]

   Auto Insurance
    1. You can save several hundred dollars a year by purchasing auto
       insurance from a licensed, low-price insurer. Call your state
       insurance department for a publication showing typical prices
       charged by different companies. Then call at least four of the
       lowest-priced, licensed insurers to learn what they would charge
       you for the same coverage.
    2. Talk to your agent or insurer about raising your deductibles on
       collision and comprehensive coverage to at least $500 or, if you
       have an old car, dropping this coverage altogether. Taking these
       steps can save you hundreds of dollars a year.
    3. Make certain that your new policy is in effect before dropping your
       old one.

     * Web Resources: http://www.naic.org/1regulator/usamap.htm or
       http://www.consumer.gov

   Homeowner/Renter Insurance
    1. You can save several hundred dollars a year on homeowner insurance
       and up to $50 a year on renter insurance by purchasing insurance
       from a low-price, licensed insurer. Ask your state insurance
       department for a publication showing typical prices charged by
       different licensed companies. Then call at least four of the lowest
       priced insurers to learn what they would charge you. If such a
       publication is not available, it is even more important to call at
       least four insurers for price quotes.
    2. Make certain you purchase enough coverage to replace the house and
       its contents. "Replacement" on the house means rebuilding to its
       current condition.
    3. Make certain your new policy is in effect before dropping your old
       one.

       http://www.fema.gov

   Life Insurance
    1. If you want insurance protection only, and not a savings and
       investment product, buy a term life insurance policy.
    2. If you want to buy a whole life, universal life, or other cash
       value policy, plan to hold it for at least 15 years. Canceling
       these policies after only a few years can more than double your
       life insurance costs.
    3. Check the National Association of Insurance Commissioners website
       (www.naic.org/servlet/cis.Main) or your local library for
       information on the financial soundness of insurance companies.

     * Web Resource: http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/acli/index.htm

   Banking
               [top66.gif]

   Checking
    1. You can save more than $100 a year in fees by selecting a checking
       account with a low (or no) minimum balance requirement that you
       can, and do, meet. Request a list of these and other fees
       (including ATM and debit card fees) that are charged on these
       accounts.
    2. Banking institutions often will drop or lower checking fees if
       paychecks are directly deposited by your employer. Direct deposit
       offers the additional advantages of convenience, security, and
       immediate access to your money.

     * Web Resource:
       http://www.frbatlanta.org/publica/brochure/check/check.htm

   Savings and Investment Products
    1. Before opening a savings or investment account with a bank or other
       financial institution, find out whether the account is insured by
       the federal government (FDIC or NCUA). An increasing number of
       products offered by these institutions, including mutual stock
       funds and annuities, are not insured.
    2. To earn the highest return on savings (annual percentage yield)
       with little or no risk, consider certificates of deposit (CDs) or
       U.S. Savings Bonds (Series I or EE).
    3. Once you select a type of savings or investment product, compare
       rates and fees offered by different institutions. These rates can
       vary a lot and, over time, can significantly affect interest
       earnings.

       http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/roadmap.htm

   Credit Cards
    1. You can save as much as a thousand dollars or more each year in
       lower credit card interest charges by paying off your entire bill
       each month or by using a check, cash or debit card for purchases.
    2. If you are unable to pay off a large balance, pay as much as you
       can and switch to a credit card with a low annual percentage rate
       (APR). You can obtain listings of low-rate credit cards through
       www.cardlocator.com or www.bankrate.com (click on credit cards),
       which provide information at no charge to consumers.
    3. You can reduce credit card fees, which may add up to well over $100
       a year, by getting rid of all but one or two cards, and by avoiding
       annual, late payment, and over-the-credit limit fees.

     * Web Resource: http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/shop

   Auto Loans
    1. If you have significant savings earning a low interest rate,
       consider making a large down payment or even paying for the car in
       cash. This could save you as much as several thousand dollars in
       finance charges.
    2. You can save as much as hundreds of dollars in finance charges by
       shopping for the cheapest loan. Contact several banks, your credit
       union, and the auto manufacturer's own finance company.

     * Web Resource: http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/autos/newcar.htm

   First Mortgage Loans
    1. Although your monthly payment may be higher, you can save tens of
       thousands of dollars in interest charges by shopping for the
       shortest-term mortgage you can afford. On a $100,000 fixed-rate
       loan at 7% annual percentage rate (APR), for example, you will pay
       over $75,000 less in interest on a 15-year mortgage than on a
       30-year mortgage.
    2. You can save thousands of dollars in interest charges by shopping
       for the lowest-rate mortgage with the fewest points. On a 15-year
       $100,000 fixed-rate mortgage, just lowering the APR from 7% to 6.5%
       can save you more than $5,000 in interest charges, and paying two
       points instead of three would save you an additional $1,000.
    3. If your local newspaper does not periodically run mortgage rate
       surveys, call at least six lenders for information about their
       rates (APRs), points, and fees. You may also check www.bankrate.com
       for mortgage information in your area. Then ask an accountant to
       compute precisely how much each mortgage option will cost and its
       tax implications.
    4. Be aware that the interest rate on most adjustable rate mortgage
       loans (ARMs) can vary a great deal over the lifetime of the
       mortgage. An increase of several percentage points might raise
       payments by hundreds of dollars per month.

     * Web Resource: http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/looking/index.html

   Mortgage Refinancing
    1. Consider refinancing your mortgage if you can get a rate that is at
       least one percentage point lower than your existing mortgage rate
       and plan to keep the new mortgage for several years or more. Ask an
       accountant to calculate precisely how much your new mortgage
       (including points, fees and closing costs) will cost and whether,
       in the long run, it will cost less than your current mortgage.

     * Web Resource:
       http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/housing/refinance/refinance.txt

   Home Equity Loans
    1. Be cautious in taking out home equity loans. The loans reduce or
       may even eliminate the equity that you have built up in your home.
       Equity is the cash you would have if you sold your house and paid
       off your mortgage loans. If you are unable to make payments, you
       could lose your home.
    2. Compare home equity loans offered by at least four reputable
       lending institutions. Consider the interest rate on the loan and
       the annual percentage rate (APR), which includes other costs, such
       as origination fees, discount points, mortgage insurance and other
       fees. Ask if the rate changes, and if so, how it is calculated and
       how frequently, as this will affect the amount of your monthly
       payments.

   Housing
              [top66.gif]

   Home Purchase
    1. You can often negotiate a lower sale price by employing a buyer
       broker who works for you not the seller. If the buyer broker or the
       broker's firm also lists properties, there may be a conflict of
       interest, so ask them to tell you if they are showing you a
       property that they have listed.
    2. Do not purchase any house until it has been examined by a home
       inspector that you selected.

     * Web Resource: http://www.hud.gov/buying

   Renting a Place to Live
    1. Do not limit your rental housing search to classified ads or
       referrals from friends and acquaintances. Select buildings where
       you would like to live and contact their building manager or owner
       to see if anything is available.
    2. Remember that signing a lease probably obligates you to make all
       monthly payments for the term of the agreement.

     * Web Resource: http://www.hud.gov/renting/index.cfm

   Home Improvement
    1. Home repairs often cost thousands of dollars and are the subject of
       frequent complaints. Select from among several well established,
       licensed contractors who have submitted written, fixed-price bids
       for the work.
    2. Do not sign any contract that requires full payment before
       satisfactory completion of the work.

     * Web Resource:
       http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/services/homeimpv.htm and
       http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/homeimp/index.html

   Major Appliances
    1. Consult Consumer Reports, available in most public libraries, for
       information about specific brands and how to evaluate them,
       including energy use. There are often great price and quality
       differences among brands.
    2. Once you've selected a brand, check the phone book to learn what
       stores carry this brand, then call at least four of these stores
       for the prices of specific models. After each store has given you a
       quote, ask if that's the lowest price they can offer you. This
       comparison shopping can save you as much as $100 or more.

     * Web Resource: http://www.eren.doe.gov/consumerinfo/appliance.html

   Utilities
                 [top66.gif]

   Electricity
    1. To save as much as hundreds of dollars a year on electricity, make
       certain that any new appliances you purchase, especially air
       conditioners and furnaces, are energy-efficient. Information on the
       energy efficiency of major appliances is found on Energy Guide
       Labels required by federal law.
    2. Enrolling in load management programs and off-hour rate programs
       offered by your electric utility may save you up to $100 a year in
       electricity costs. Call your electric utility for information about
       these cost-saving programs.

   Home Heating
    1. A home energy audit can identify ways to save up to hundreds of
       dollars a year on home heating (and air conditioning). Ask your
       electric or gas utility if they can do this audit for free or for a
       reasonable charge. If they cannot, ask them to refer you to a
       qualified professional.

     * Web Resource: http://hes.lbl.gov/hes

   Telephone Service
    1. At least once a year review your phone bills for the previous three
       months to see what local, local toll, long distance, and
       international calls you normally make. Call several phone
       companies, including wireless companies, to find an inexpensive
       calling plan that meets your needs.
    2. If you make very few toll or long distance calls, avoid calling
       plans with monthly fees or minimums.
    3. Check your phone bill to see if you have optional calling services
       you don't use. Each option you drop could save you $40 or more each
       year.
    4. Before making calls when away from home, compare per minute rates
       and surcharges for different prepaid phone cards and calling card
       plans to find the one that saves you the most money.
    5. Dial your long distance calls directly. Using an operator to place
       the call can cost you up to $10 extra.
    6. If you use a wireless phone, make sure your wireless calling plan
       covers the calls you typically make. Understand promotions, peak
       calling periods, area coverage and roaming, and long distance
       requirements to avoid paying too much.

             [top66.gif]

   Food Purchased at Markets
    1. You can save hundreds of dollars a year by shopping at the
       lower-priced food stores. Convenience stores often charge the
       highest prices.
    2. You will spend less on food if you shop with a list.
    3. You can save hundreds of dollars a year by comparing
       price-per-ounce or other unit prices on shelf labels. Stock up on
       those items with low per-unit costs.

     * Web Resource:
       http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/thriftyliving/tl-savefood.html

   Prescription Drugs
    1. Since brand name drugs are usually much more expensive than their
       generic equivalents, ask your physician and pharmacist for generic
       drugs whenever appropriate.
    2. Since pharmacies may charge widely different prices for the same
       medicine, call several. When taking a drug for a long time, also
       consider calling mail-order pharmacies, which often charge lower
       prices.

   Funeral Arrangements
    1. Make your wishes known about your funeral, memorial, or burial
       arrangements in writing. Be cautious about prepaying because there
       may be risks involved.
    2. For information about the least costly options, which could save
       you several thousand dollars, contact a local memorial society,
       which is usually listed in the Yellow Pages under funeral services.
    3. Before selecting a funeral home, call several and ask for prices of
       specific goods and services, or visit them to obtain an itemized
       price list. You are entitled to this information by law and, by
       using it to comparison shop, you can save hundreds of dollars.
