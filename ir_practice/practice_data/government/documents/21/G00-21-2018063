                         President Bush Gives First
                         State of the Union Address

                   Focuses on fighing terrorism, homeland
                              security, economy

   President Bush told Congress and the nation, in his first State of the
      Union address January 29, that the war against terrorism is just
                                 beginning.

   Speaking in the context of the September 11 al Qaeda terrorist attacks
    on the United States and the subsequent allied response, Bush warned
      that "Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of
    murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout
    the world like ticking time bombs, set to go off without warning." He
      vowed that the United States will be "steadfast, and patient, and
                        persistent" in stopping them.

                Taylor Calls EU Anti-Terror Efforts 'Superb'

                   U.S. coordinator for counter-terrorism
                   speaks at press roundtable in Brussels

   European Union efforts to combat terrorism since September 11 have been
        "superb," Ambassador Francis X. Taylor, U.S. coordinator for
                     counter-terrorism, said January 29.

   Taylor, who was in Brussels to meet with EU and NATO officials, said it
   is now time for the United States and the EU to build on the excellent
    cooperation already achieved by dealing with extradition matters and
         improving the exchange of intelligence and law enforcement
                                information.
