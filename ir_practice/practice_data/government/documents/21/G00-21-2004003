   Black Dot The Accident Reduction Program
       We continue to develop the "Accident Reduction Program."   It
       consists of pages offering ways to prevent accidents before they
       happen. It will offer an interactive option as well. We are
       providing you, the worker, an opportunity to contribute your
       thoughts and ideas on accident prevention.

   Black Dot Technology Exchange - Content Added 10/17/2001
   The engineers and scientists who work for Technical Support are
       periodically requested to provide specialized technical training
       for the mining community. These sessions can be general, or focused
       to a special commodity such as coal mining, gold mining, aggregate
       mining, etc.
