   [Common Drugs of Abuse___]

   The Monitoring the Future Survey, conducted by the University of
   Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded by the National
   Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), at the National Institutes of Health,
   has tracked 12th graders' illicit drug use and attitudes towards drugs
   since 1975. In 1991, 8th and 10th graders were added to the study. The
   2001 study surveyed more than 44,000 students in 424 schools across the
   nation about their lifetime use, past year use, past month use, daily
   use of drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.

   Results from the 2001 Survey have been released. To get the latest
