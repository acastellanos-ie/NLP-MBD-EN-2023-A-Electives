MBDA MED Week 2001 Discussion Brief - Energy & Utilities Industry

New findings link strategic opportunites for Minority Businesses and Energy
and Utilities Industries.

   September 21st, 2001

   The Energy and utilities industry is undergoing deregulation and
   restructuring
     * 24 states and District of Columbia already engaged in opening
       wholesale and retial markets to competition


   Customer choice is a reality
     * Price value and corporate image key determinants in selecting an
       energy provider


   Top Ten Minority-Concentrated States account for over 50% of Industry
   revenues
     * Minority commercial and residential market is $27 billion

     * Potentially $40 billion in ten years

     * Significant impact on utilities located in top minority markets


   Minority business development can be a strategic tool for utilities
     * Effective way to connect with growing consumer base
     * Representation of interest with key stakeholders and government
       constituents
     * Enhances broad differentiation and corporate image to build
       customer loyalty


   Minority Businesses are Essential Partners in Growing Economic Value


   Industry undergoing deregulation and restructuring of the value chain

   $86 Billion of sourcing opportunities currently exist in the Industry
     * Opportunities will require capabilities and sharpened strategic
       focus to be successful


   New electricity infrastructure build-out occurring and will provide
   opportunities for Minority Business growth
     * Limited generating capacity and transmission line constraints will
       increase capital expenditures
     * Stringent environmental standards and efficiency requirements will
       drive new plant equipment upgrades
     * Build-out may be comparable to the last five years in the
       Telecommunications Industry


   Challenge is how to engage new and existing players at each stage of
   the value chain to drive minority inclusion


   Need to develop new paradigm in driving Minority Business growth
     * From seeking sourcing opportunities with industry players to
       partnering with them to drive revenue growth and shareholder value
