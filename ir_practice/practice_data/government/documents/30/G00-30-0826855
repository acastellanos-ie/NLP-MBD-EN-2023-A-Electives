   Background top

   The Deep Space Network (DSN) was established in 1958 and since then it
   has evolved into the largest and most sensitive scientific
   telecommunications and radio navigation network in the world. The
   purpose of the DSN is to support unpiloted interplanetary spacecraft
   missions and support radio and radar astronomy observations in the
   exploration of the solar system and the universe.

   AI Technology top
     * Artificial Intelligence techniques: temporal constraint networks,
       knowledge-based tactics.
     * Operation Research techniques: Scheduling dispatch rules, heuristic
       search.
     * Metaobject Protocol design.
     * Object Library of commonly-used resource and job types.
     * Advanced human machine interface design.


   Problem top
     * The number of projects using the 26-meter subnetwork is increasing.
     * The current scheduling process is negotiation-based and is
       therefore expensive, time-consiming, and doesn't necessarily result
       in the ``best'' schedule.
     * As the loading increases the complexity of scheduling exponentially
       increases.
     * The current manual scheduling process will become prohibitively
       expensive (basd on predicted future demand for support).
     * The DSN is not reimbursed for representing the projects in the
       scheduling negotiations.


   Impact top
     * Hot Button for DSN Operations
     * Delivered in 3 Months
     * Immediately Used by Operations
     * Achieved 30% reduction in workhours while supporting a 100%
       increase of spacecrafts supported by 26M subnetwork
     * Agressive insertion of advanced technology into a high pressure
       operations environment


   Status top

   Was delivered to the DSN scheduling group in 1994 and has been in
   operation for the last 3 years.

   Description top

   The objective of this task is to provide automated, reactive schedule
   generation and maintenance capabilities to support 26-meter antennas
   scheduling and Real Time scheduling operations for JPL's Deep Space
   Network (DSN). The OMP tools has been expanded to incorporate automated
   scheduling/rescheduling capabiliites.

   Significance top
     * Generates a conflict-free schedule from the projects' generic
       requests.
     * Performs automated schedule maintenance.
     * Greatly reduces the need for schedule negotiation meetings.


   More Information top

   Features:
     * Table-driven inputs, e.g., Resources, Projects, Activity Types,
       Requests.
     * GUI interface to display schedule and resource conflicts.
     * Uses AI and OR techniques to autonomously produce a schedule.
     * Minimally perturbs an existing schedule to accommodate new tasks.
     * Adjusts the schedule to match the most recent generated view
       periods.
