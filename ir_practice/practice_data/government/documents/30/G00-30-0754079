   [DMpic.jpg] The SESP generates an enormous volume of data as a result
   of surveillance activities on and around the Hanford Site. Effective
   data management is essential for ensuring quality results that are able
   to be audited. The primary objective in data management within SESP is
   to manage data in a manner that ensures timely collection, analysis,
   reporting, and validation in accordance with the Hanford Site
   Environmental Surveillance Master Sampling Schedule. This is achieved
   using the Hanford Environmental Information System (HEIS) where the
   SESP maintains data management functions including scheduling sampling
   events, sample and result accountability/tracking. HEIS is an
   operational system specifically designed and implemented for Hanford
   Site environmental data and is a consolidated set of automated
   resources that effectively manage the data gathered during
   environmental monitoring and restoration efforts on and around the
   Hanford Site.
