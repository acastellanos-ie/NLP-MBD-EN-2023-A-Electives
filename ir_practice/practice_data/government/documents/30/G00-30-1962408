The Western Earth Surface Processes Team

   spacer image The western region of the United States is the most
   geologically active and varied part of the country. The role of the
   team is to provide the geologic information required to understand the
   interactions among humans, plants, animals, air, water, soil, and rock
   on the Earth's surface region. This information is provided by the
   publication of a variety of geologic maps and databases, and scientific
   reports, and by participation in programs designed to improve the
   understanding of geologic information and the ability to use it for
   informed decision making. The team is composed of geologists,
   geophysicists, paleontologists, and support personnel stationed at the
   Western Region Headquarters in Menlo Park, California, and at field
   stations throughout the western states.

Current feature:
Lifelines and earthquakes in the greater Seattle area

   spacer image Seattle and Puget Sound are earthquake country. In the
   early 1990s scientists and engineers accepted geologic evidence that
   great subduction zone earthquakes, of magnitude 8 to 9, repeatedly
   strike along the Washington coast. Since then, researchers have sought
   to understand the potential for large-magnitude earthquakes in the
   Seattle area.
   spacer image The results are sobering. Preliminary measurements show
   clear evidence that strain is slowly building toward the next
   earthquake.
   spacer image Like any modern urban area, the greater Seattle area
   depends on highways, railroads, pipelines, ports, airports,
   communications, and the electrical power system to sustain its economic
   life. Many of these critical lifelines lie across the path of faults.
   spacer image A new map shows the relation of lifeline elements to
   selected earthquake hazards. The map is designed to give citizens,
   engineers, planners, and decision-makers an overview of lifelines and
   earthquake hazards in the greater Seattle area. Click here for on-line
   version.
