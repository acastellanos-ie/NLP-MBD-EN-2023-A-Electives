GENEALOGY

  Although censuses are a source of genealogical information, the Census Bureau
  does not provide these data. The Census Bureau is not able to locate missing
  persons, or provide recent information on individuals.

   In keeping with the Census Bureau's commitment to confidentiality, the
   Census Bureau information collected in the Decennial Census of
   Population and Housing on individuals does not become available to the
   public until after 72 years.

   If you are looking for information on genealogy please see number 2
   below and our FAQ.

    1. What the Census Bureau has--
       The only service we provide related to genealogy is the Age Search
       Service.
       In addition, we have two offerings that may be of interest to
       genealogists. They are counts of names from the 1990 Census. We
       have no other names data.
          + Frequently Occurring First Names and Surnames From the 1990
            Census
            NOTE: These files contain only a sample of the 1990
            population. The fact that a name does not appear, does not
            mean that it is nonexistent, only that it is reasonably rare.
            For more information about the limitations of the data see the
            documentation file.

       of decennial census forms from 1790 through 1920 are available on

       Administration in Washington, DC, at Archives regional centers, and
