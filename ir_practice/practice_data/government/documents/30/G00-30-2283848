                            QuikSCAT Ocean Winds
   At near-real-time, twice-daily maps of ocean surface winds over global
   oceans, derived from the observations by the scatterometer SeaWinds on
   space mission QuikSCAT, of the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration (NASA). Get the real-time QuikSCAT data here.
                              NSCAT Ocean Winds
   More than 9 months of surface wind field, stress, and curl of stress
   derived from observations of the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT),starting
   September 15, 1996, at 0.5 degree latitude by 0.5 degree longitude
   resolution, every 12 hours, are available on-line. The NSCAT winds are
   objectively interplated by successive correction and the methodology is
   described in W.T. Liu, W. Tang and P.S. Polito, 1998: NASA
   Scatterometert provides global ocean-surface wind fields with more
   structures than numerical weather prediction (Geophys. Res. Lett., Vol
   25, No. 6, 761-764). The NSCAT data sets was produced by Wenqing Tang
   and W. Timothy Liu with supports from the NASA Earth Observing System
   (EOS) Interdiscipline Science Program, the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT)
   Project, and the NASA/NOAA Enhanced Data Set Program. Another set of
   NSCAT gridded data using Correlation-Based Interpolation (CBI) method
   is also available (Polito, P.S., W.T. Liu, and W. Tang, 2000:
   Correlation-based interpolation of NSCAT wind data. J. Atmos. and Ocean
   Tech. 17, 1016-1026.)
                              ERS Ocean Winds
   Ocean surface winds from ERS are also available upon request, starting
   from 1992 to 1996, at 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude
   resolution, every 12 hours. For the gridding method, please refer the
   article by Tang and Liu [JPL Publication 96-19,1996]. The ERS data set
   was produced by Wenqing Tang and W. Timothy Liu with supports from the
   NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Interdiscipline Science Program, the
   NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Project, and the NASA/NOAA Enhanced Data Set
   Program.
                    Hourly NDBC Equivalent Neutral Wind
   All data between 9/96 and 10/96 accessible to us are converted to
   equivalent neutral winds (ENW) at both 10 m and 19.5 m height. There
   are different kinds of buoy mixed together, not all of which are
   suitable for evaluating NSCAt winds; see station identifier. The
   definition and method of computing ENW is described in Liu and Tang
   [JPL Publication 96-17, 1996]. Conditions under which ENW is derived
   are indicated by Flag.
                     Hourly TAO Equivalent Neutral Wind
   Hourly TAO buoy data coincident with NSCAT observations provided
   through the courtesy of Mike Caruso are converted to equivalent neutral
   winds (ENW) at both 10 m and 19.5 reference height. The definition and
   method of computing ENW are described by Liu and Tang [JPL Publication
   96-17, 1996], the text of which is displayed in this homepage.
   Conditions under which ENW is derived are indicated by a Flag (see
   definition below). The colocated TAO buoy and NSCAT data are accessible
   through Mike Caruso's homepage
   http://rsag.whoi.edu/nscat/tao/nscat_tao.html. The TAO buoys and
   instrument were deployed and the data collected by the NOAA Pacific
   Marine Environmental Laboratory.

   Computer Codes and hardcopy of the paper Equivalent Neutral Wind by W.
   Timothy Liu and Wenqing Tang is published by JPL Publication 96-17,
   August 1, 1996.
