     The Hollings Marine Laboratory (HML), will be built on an
   approximately 8-acre site within the Fort Johnson campus of the South
   Carolina Department of Natural Resources in Charleston, South
   Carolina.The National Ocean Service, Charleston Laboratory is currently
   located on this campus in leased facilities. The College of Charleston
   and the Medical University of South Carolina also have existing
   facilities on this campus.

   The HML will be a premier high technology marine research center with
   programs that apply new scientific techniques to fisheries and marine
   resource management. Scientists will use new tools to assess the
   ecological health of the marine environment and the potential hazards
   of pollution on marine ecosystems. Scientists will also provide the
   information that can be used to address environmental problems and the
   means to evaluate the restoration of natural habitats.
