   Personal Information and Choice .

   "Personal information" is information about a natural person that is
   readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information
   includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone
   number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered
   personal information.

   We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily
   participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e. sending an
   email or participating in a survey). If you choose not to participate
   in these activities, your choice will in no way effect your ability to
   use any other feature of HamiltonTN.gov.

   If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by
   the user, state law and the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.
   However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and
   may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
   federal or state law.

   Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information
   requested from or volunteered by children (those under the age of 18)
   on-line or by email will be treated the same as information given by an
   adult, and may be subject to public access.
     __________________________________________________________________
