                             Current Local Initiatives

        I have been working on a number of issues that are important to the
        San Gabriel Valley and Southern California in general:

       Public Safety | Technology | Environment | Cancer Research | "Runaway
                                    Production"
          Transportation | Community Development | Disaster Preparedness
        ____________________________________________________________________

   Public Safety

        At the request of Congressman Dreier, H.R. 2500, the Departments of
        Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies
        Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002 includes funding for
        important local initiatives. The legislation, which was approved by
        the House on November 14, and was signed into law by the President
        on November 28, allocates funding for the cities of Sierra Madre and
        Arcadia to establish a permanent Emergency Operations Center. The
        Center will enable the cities to more effectively respond to natural
        disasters such as earthquakes, floods and fires.

        The bill also provides funds to equip policemen from Sierra Madre
        and Arcadia with new radios. In addition, H.R. 2500 includes
        additional funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program,
        the Violence Against Women Act and the Drug Enforcement
        Administration.

   Technology

        The Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development
        Appropriations Act, H.R. 2620, provides the Jet Propulsion
        Laboratory and NASA with full funding for 2002. The legislation
        rejects a Senate proposal to reduce funding for unmanned space
        exploration and to transfer critical JPL functions to other states.
        In addition, the bill would provide additional funding for veterans
        health care and other benefits. Congressman Dreier has been an
        active supporter of the bill.

        H.R. 2620 passed the House on November 8, and was signed into law by
        the President on November 26. For more, read what the Pasadena Star
        News had to say about this legislation.

   Environment

        The San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Initiative would allocate up to
        $85 million of federal funds for clean up efforts of the Los Angeles
        County water supply. The bill calls for local authorities to work
        with the Bureau of Reclamation in a cooperative manner to halt the
        spread of perchlorates and other pollutants through local
        groundwater and to remove it where it has already been detected,
        therefore ensuring the safety of the drinking water for about three
        million residents in Los Angeles County.

        The San Gabriel Water Quality Initiative was funded at an initial
        level of $23 million in fiscal year 2001. On November 1, the House
        gave final approval to H.R. 2311, the Energy and Water Development
        Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, which includes an
        additional $12 million in funding for the Water Quality Initiative.
        The legislation was signed into law by the President on November 12.

   Cancer Research

        Congressman Dreier joined with several colleagues to introduce H.R.
        2725, legislation to extend the sales of the U.S. Postal Service's
        Breast Cancer Research Stamp through 2008. Sales of the stamp -
        which was enacted partially through the hard work and efforts of the
        West Covina-based organization WIN Against Breast Cancer - have
        already raised over $21 million for breast cancer research in less
        than three years.

        The House passed H.R. 2590, the Treasury and General Government
        Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, which includes provisions
        based on H.R. 2725. The legislation extends sales of the Breast
        Cancer Stamp through December 31, 2003, and also creates the 9/11
        Heroes stamp to raise funds for families of rescue personnel who
        were killed or permanently disabled in the terrorist attacks in New
        York and at the Pentagon.

        At the request of Congressman Dreier, H.R. 3338, the Department of
        Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, funds City of Hope
        National Medical Centers Biomedical Research Imaging program. The
        funding recognizes that scientists at City of Hope have made
        important strides in imaging of tumor cells, and it will assist the
        center in assembling critical resources for a program and core
        facility in biomedical research imaging. The assistance will be used
        to purchase a range of advanced imaging technologies, including
        research support to permit the recruitment of new scientists.

   Runaway Production

        Congressman Dreier has introduced H.R. 3131, the United States
        Independent Film and Television Production Incentive Act of 2001,
        which provides a tax credit for film and television projects
        produced in the United States. It includes a wage tax credit of
        25-35 percent, to be paid to each employee on qualified U.S.
        productions, including small businesses associated with film
        productions and runaway productions. The legislation recognizes that
        production of movies and television projects has become an extremely
        competitive international market, as other nations have created
        incentives to lure valuable production jobs.

        The legislation is currently being considered by the House Committee
        on Ways and Means. Read more about the effort in a story from the LA
        Times.

   Transportation

        H.R. 2299, the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act for
        fiscal year 2002, provides $4 million for the Alameda Corridor East
        Transportation Authority to eliminate conflicts between rail lines
        and surface roads in the San Gabriel Valley. Congressman Dreier has
        helped to secure approximately $140 million in funding for this
        effort, which is extremely important given the long wait time that
        drivers already experience at rail crossings.

        The legislation also allocates $1.25 million to Foothill Transit,
        for the purchase of clean natural gas busses and related facility
        improvements. The transition by Foothill to clean, alternative-fuel
        vehicles, will help improve air quality in Southern California.

        In addition, H.R. 2299 contains $2 million for road repairs at the
        California State Polytechnic University. The $2 million will be used
        by the University to begin a long term project, repairing the campus
        most heavily traveled roads. Without the funding, the University
        would not have had the resources necessary to undertake the project
        thereby forcing Cal Poly to severely diminish campus bus service,
        restricting access to students and community residents who depend on
        the campus bus system for transportation to and from campus.

        Lastly, the measure funds the City of Monrovias natural gas vehicle
        fueling facility. This facility will help encourage the use of
        natural gas vehicles by both fleets and private vehicles.

        H.R. 2299 received final approval in the House of Representatives on
        November 30. The bill was signed into law by the President on
        December 18.

   Community Development

        H.R. 2620, the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban
        Development Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, provides
        $490,000 to the City of Monrovia for the old Town Revitalization
        Project.

        The legislation received final approval in the House of
        Representatives on November 8, and was signed into law by the
        President on November 26.

   Disaster Preparedness

        H.R. 2620, the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban
        Development Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, provides $1.8
        million for the cities of Arcadia and Sierra Madre to improve the
        resistance of their drinking water system to earthquakes and other
        seismic events. Dreier has long supported this joint effort by the
        cities to ensure that drinking water remains safe and available for
        residents after earthquakes. H.R. 2620 was approved by the House on
        November 8, and was signed into law by the President on November 26.
