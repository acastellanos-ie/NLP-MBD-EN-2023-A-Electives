   The U.S. Department of Energy manages a comprehensive collaborative
   effort to improve nuclear safety at Soviet-designed nuclear power
   plants in nine partnering countries. In addition to these nine host
   countries, the G-7 nations and many international organizations
   collaborate on this effort.

  Improve Safety and Reduce Risks By

     * improving physical operating conditions
     * installing safety equipment
     * developing improved safety procedures
     * establishing regional centers for training reactor personnel
     * installing simulators for training control room operators
     * conducting in-depth safety assessments
     * developing institutional and regulatory frameworks
     * addressing the extraordinary problems at Chornobyl.

  Benefits

     * Reduces the likelihood of a nuclear accident.
     * Protects Europe's public, economic and environmental health and the
       health of U.S. citizens in Europe.
     * Promotes a stable climate for international investments in
       countries with Soviet-designed reactors.
