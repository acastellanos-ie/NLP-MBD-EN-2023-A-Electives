                   Summary - Current Statewide Conditions
                              January 18, 2002

   Water Year 2002 (October 2001 - September 2002)

   For the latest information on some key hydrologic indicators, click

   About half of California's average annual precipitation occurs in the
   December-February time period. Although it is still early for
   characterizing Water Year 2002 as being wet or dry, conditions to date
   are encouraging.

   Snowpack water content throughout the Sierra Nevada is well above
   average for this time of year, and is substantially above that of last
   year at this time. The Department currently forecasts that there is at
   least a 50-50 chance of runoff in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River
   systems being slightly above average for the water year. These
   forecasts will be updated throughout the winter and spring, to reflect
   changes in Sierra Nevada snowpack accumulation.

   Water Year 2001 (October 2000 - September 2001)

   Water year 2001 was California's first dry year following six years of
   wet to average conditions. Storage in most of the State's major
   reservoirs was above average at the beginning of the water year,
   reflecting prior wet conditions.

   Water year 2001 runoff in key Sierra Nevada watersheds - the source of
   much of California's agricultural and urban water supply - was about 45
   percent to 70 percent of average. Reflecting these conditions, the
   Department's State Water Project contractors and the U.S. Bureau of
   Reclamation's Central Valley Project agricultural export contractors
   were allocated less than half their requested deliveries. Water
   contractors in USBR's Klamath Project, one of the State's driest areas
   in water year 2001, received only minimal deliveries. The impacts of a
   dry 2001 were minimized for most other large water systems by generally
   good storage in reservoirs and groundwater basins.

   Some watersheds - most notably in coastal southern California -
   received above-average precipitation in water year 2001. The
   above-average precipitation in this area is not an accurate indicator
   of water supply conditions, since urbanized southern California has
   historically relied at least 60 percent on imported water supplies.
   Southern California's imported supplies come from watersheds on the
   western and eastern slopes on the Sierra Nevada, and from the Colorado
   River. USBR declared the Colorado River to be in a surplus (wet)
   condition in water year 2001.
