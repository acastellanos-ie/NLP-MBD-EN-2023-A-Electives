    Five major areas of research define the scope of ERS activity. These
   research areas derive from strategic planning in USDA for its research,
                      economics, and education mission.
   Each research area encompasses a body of ERS workpresented in Briefing
   Rooms, publications, data, and other products and servicesaddressing
                    one of the following strategic goals:
     * A competitive agricultural system
     * A safe food supply
     * A healthy, well-nourished population
     * Harmony between agriculture and the environment
     * An enhanced quality of life for rural Americans
