  Ex-Im Bank Environmental Exports Program

   Ex-Im Bank has established an "Environmental Exports Program" which
   increases the level of support it provides to exporters of
   environmentally beneficial goods and services, as well as to exporters
   participating in foreign environmentally beneficial projects. This
   program affords exporters a special level of support in conjunction
   with either Ex-Im Bank`s Insurance Program or with Ex-Im Bank`s loan
   and guarantee programs. It underscores Ex-Im Bank`s resolve to reach
   out to small and large exporters alike whose exports qualify for the
   features associated with program.

  Ex-Im Bank Environmental Policy

   Ex-Im Bank`s Charter authorizes the Board of Directors to grant or
   withhold financing support after taking into account the beneficial and
   adverse environmental effects of proposed transactions. Ex-Im Bank`s
   objective is to maintain U.S. exporters` competitiveness in the global
   marketplace while ensuring that the projects it supports are
   environmentally responsible. Environmental Procedures and Guidelines
   have been adopted which set forth Ex-Im Bank`s environmental
   objectives. These Procedures and Guidelines include nine sector tables
   which list qualitative and quantitative limits for elements such as air
   and water quality against which the Engineering and Environment
   Division will evaluate the environmental effects of projects within
   these industrial sectors. Comprehensive information is provided in the
   following documents:
