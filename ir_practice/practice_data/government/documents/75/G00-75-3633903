     __________________________________________________________________

Goal 1: Prepare and Update the California Water Plan

   The Department's statewide responsibility for water planning is
   fulfilled through the Statewide Planning Program. The initial plan, The
   California Water Plan, was presented in Bulletin 3, published in 1957.

   The plan is updated every five years to reflect changes in resources
   and urban, agricultural, and environmental water demands. It suggests
   ways of managing demand and augmenting supply to balance water supply
   with demand. Updates to the plan help shape federal, State, and local
   decisions on water allocations, conservation, and development.

Strategies to Meet This Goal

   The Department updates water development and management guidelines
   through the Bulletin 160 report series, which incorporates the
   following strategies:
     * Assessment of Water Supplies. Estimate California's total water
       resources, including developed and undeveloped surface and ground
       water supplies.
     * Forecast of Water Needs. Estimate California's current and future
       water needs for urban, agricultural and environmental purposes,
       based on changing population, economics, social requirements, and
       environmental objectives.
     * Balance of Supplies and Needs. Identify possible measures for
       balancing supplies with needs, including conservation, recycling,
       conjunctive use, new facilities, and transfers.
     * Consideration of Special Factors. Evaluate the impact of special
       factors - such as federal and State regulations (particularly
       related to the environment), Delta operations and issues, and
       interstate water projects - on California's water resources.

   The most recent update of the California Water Plan, Bulletin 160-98,
   was released in January, 1998.

     * Access the DWR Planning Division's Reports Administration Home Page
       for the full text of this bulletin.

Goal 2: Plan, Design, Construct, Operate, and Maintain the State Water
Project

   The State Water Project must be effectively managed to capture and
   deliver good quality water for municipal, industrial, agricultural,
   recreational, and environmental uses. This must be accomplished in an
   economical, reliable, and environmentally sound manner.

Strategies to Meet This Goal

     * Assessment of the Water Supply Reliability of the SWP. Estimate SWP
       yield under varying hydrologic, quality, and operating standards to
       determine the need for water supply augmentations.
     * Planning for SWP Supply Augmentation. Plan on-stream and off-stream
       storage facilities, transportation facilities, water transfers,
       ground water banking and conjunctive use, and changes in operation
       to augment SWP supplies.
     * Identification of Environmental Measures that Maximize Water Use
       Efficiency. Protect fish and wildlife by implementing measures such
       as gravel restoration and poaching and predation control.
     * Design and Construction of New SWP Facilities and Major
       Modifications to Existing Facilities. Assure that all work is
       designed in accordance with applicable permits, codes, and
       standards, and that construction proceeds in an economical manner
       consistent with those standards.
     * Operation and Maintenance of the SWP with Maximum Flexibility and
       Reliability. Meet urban, agricultural and environmental needs with
       available water supplies by carefully considering requests for
       water.
     * Monitoring and Complying with All Applicable Regulations and
       Standards Affecting Management of the SWP. Develop and manage the
       SWP in accordance with applicable contracts, rules, and
       regulations.
     * Management of the SWP According to Sound Economic and Fiscally
       Responsible Policies. Help SWP contractors maintain financial
       stability. Encourage and maintain a focus among Department
       employees on developing efficient, cost-effective solutions to
       California's water problems. Strive to develop and streamline
       processes geared to these ends.
     __________________________________________________________________

Goal 3: Protect and Restore the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta

   The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is a the focal point of a wide variety
   of water issues in California. Many different interests have a vital
   stake in the Delta, including farmers, fish and wildlife groups,
   environmentalists, boaters, shipping and navigation concerns, and the
   people and industries that receive water from the Delta.

   Governor Wilson recognized the importance of the Delta in his 1992
   water policy, which called for interim and long-term solutions for
   fixing the "broken Delta."

   To this end, the Governor established the Water Policy Council and Bay
   Delta Oversight Council to reconcile and accommodate the various
   interests receiving benefit from the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary.

   In the fall of 1994, the Governor and the Secretary of the Interior
   created the Bay/Delta Ecosystem Partnership, committing the State and
   federal governments to jointly sponsor and manage a process to document
   long-term solutions for the Bay-Delta Estuary.

   Participating in these efforts, the Department works together with
   State, federal, local, and private interests to provide for salinity
   control, flood control, and water supply while protecting and restoring
   the environment in the Delta and adjacent estuary.

Strategies to Meet This Goal

   The Department has developed the following strategies to plan and
   implement protection of the Delta's multiple interests now and in the
   future:
     * Assessment of Delta Water Needs. Identify the factors affecting
       beneficial uses and estimate water-related needs in the Delta,
       Suisun Marsh, and San Francisco Bay.
     * Support Efforts of Bay/Delta Ecosystem Partnership. Develop and
       evaluate plans to improve conditions in the Delta.
     * Mitigation of Impacts. Develop protective measures to avoid or
       offset adverse impacts to the environment of the Delta and Suisun
       Marsh. Operate the SWP in conformance with water quality standards,
       endangered species requirements, and other regulations.
     * Improvement of Water Quality and Water Supply Reliability of Water
       Transfers. Develop interim and long-term Delta solutions that
       improve water quality and water supply reliability while protecting
       and restoring fish and wildlife habitat.
     * Protection of Local Supplies. Implement measures and cost sharing
       approaches to address local Delta and Suisun Marsh water quality
       and supply problems.
     * Preservation of Delta Levees. Develop measures to rehabilitate and
       maintain the Delta levee and channel system to sustain associated
       multiple uses, including salinity control, flood control, and fish
       and wildlife habitat.
     __________________________________________________________________

Goal 4: Regulate Dams, Provide Flood Protection, and Assist in Emergency
Management

   The Department's public safety responsibilities consist of:
    1. Close supervision of the design, construction, operation, and
       maintenance of California's dams to ensure safe dam performance;
    2. Flood protection measures to prevent loss of human life and reduce
       property damage caused by flooding; and
    3. Management assistance as required by the State Emergency Plan and
       the California Water Code to help people cope with emergencies.

REGULATE DAMS

   The California Water Code entrusts the regulatory Dam Safety Program to
   the Department. The principal goal of this program is to avoid dam
   failure and thus prevent loss of life and destruction of property. Dams
   under State jurisdiction are an essential element of the California
   infrastructure that provides constant water supply integrity.

Strategies to Meet This Goal

     * Respond Immediately to Incidents Involving Potential Dam Failure.
       Use all State resources necessary to abate the emergency.
     * Review and Approve Applications, Plans, and Specifications for Dam
       Construction or Alteration. Carefully monitor the construction
       phase to assure quality compliance with the approved application.
     * Conduct Annual or More Frequent Inspections of Dams. Assure the
       safe physical performance of all jurisdictional dams in California
       through such inspection.
     * Review Performance of Existing Dams. Carefully review pertinent
       data and selectively conduct reevaluations of dams for which data
       indicate threatening deficiencies.
     * Identify Illegal Dams. Effect removal of dams built and operated
       without State supervision, or supervise remedial work to bring such
       dams into compliance with State Law.

PROVIDE FLOOD PROTECTION

   The principal goals of the Flood Management Program are to prevent loss
   of human life and reduce property damage caused by floods and to
   provide runoff forecasts and maintain a real-time hydrologic database.
   Flood management activities recognize the importance of environmental
   resources and strive to protect these and other resources when meeting
   public safety responsibilities.

Strategy to Meet This Goal

   The strategy to protect the public from harm caused by floods employs a
   balanced approach among nonstructural programs (those which influence
   how flood-prone areas are used to reduce the risk to people, property,
   and natural resources), structural measures (physical works which
   regulate or redirect the flow of water), and emergency flood-warning
   and flood-fighting activities. This strategy is composed of four basic
   elements:
     * Assistance to Local Communities. Help community officials prepare
       floodplain management plans and evaluate impacts of proposed
       development in flood-prone areas. Discourage unwise development in
       areas subject to flooding and promote floodproofing of existing and
       proposed structures in floodplains where development is already
       under way.
     * Safeguarding of Flood Protection Facilities. Ensure structural
       integrity and hydraulic capacity of existing flood protection
       facilities in the Central Valley in cooperation with local
       maintaining agencies and in coordination with The Reclamation
       Board, which shares some responsibilities with the Department in
       the Central Valley.
     * Support for Development of New Facilities. Support planning and
       construction of new flood control facilities in areas of critical
       need in coordination with The Reclamation Board, the California
       Water commission, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
     * Runoff Forecasting, Emergency Operations, and Data Support Provide
       flood and water supply forecasting, high water warning and flood
       information dissemination systems, flood-fighting advice and
       assistance, and (through the California Data Exchange Center)
       year-round hydrologic data.

ASSIST IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

   The principal goal of emergency management assistance is to fulfill the
   emergency response functions of the Department established in the
   California State Emergency Plan and the California Water Code,
   including provision of technical and physical assistance to the Federal
   Emergency Management Agency, the State Office of Emergency Services,
   and other agencies that make federal and State resources available to
   local communities.

Strategies to Meet This Goal

     * Implement Preventive Measures. Protect the Department's personnel,
       equipment, supplies, facilities, and vital public records against
       the destructive forces of nature and people.
     * Respond Immediately to Emergencies. Inspect State jurisdictional
       dams, SWP facilities, Delta levees, and federal project levees for
       damage due to natural disasters. Continue essential services and
       direct all other resources, as necessary and appropriate, to
       accomplish specific objectives described in the State Emergency
       Plan.
     * Investigate and Report on Disaster Conditions and Provide Technical
       Assistance for Damage Assessment. Furnish to the Director and
       others within the Department natural disaster damage data and other
       information relating to disaster conditions. Provide technical
       personnel to investigate and report on disaster-caused damages and
       restoration of damaged facilities.
     * Help Develop Hazard Mitigation Plans. Provide information to OES to
       develop hazard mitigation plans required by FEMA which, when
       implemented, will reduce future damage to private and public
       facilities caused by natural disasters.
     __________________________________________________________________

Goal 5: Educate the Public on the Importance of Water and Its Proper Use

   Educating people on the importance of water and how this limited
   resource is properly used is an essential goal of the Department. This
   commitment to education is aimed at the general public, schools, and
   other interests.

Strategies to Meet This Goal

   The Department's approach to water education is varied and broad-based.
   It encompasses many forms and targets various audiences and age groups.

     * Education of the Public on the Importance of Water and Its Proper
       Use. Inform people about what they can do to protect and conserve
       their limited water supplies. Increase public understanding and
       appreciation of California's water resources (including water
       necessary for environmental protection and enhancement) through the
       Department's water education program and curriculum for schools,
       and campaigns for water conservation and Water Awareness Month.

     * Informing the Public About the Department and Its Programs. Broaden
       public understanding of how the Department is involved in managing
       the State's water resources to benefit the public and environment.
       Keep the media, water agencies, and the State Legislature informed
       about Department programs by issuing reports, newsletters, news
       releases, fact sheets, advisories, op-ed articles, brochures, and
       videos, and by responding to media and public inquiries.
     * Education of the Public on the Hazards of Water. Encourage people
       to practice safe behavior while visiting State Water Project (SWP)
       facilities. Minimize accidents and drownings along the SWP by
       telling people how to avoid dangerous situations and still enjoy
       the SWP's recreational benefits. Education people on potential
       flood hazards along California's rivers and streams and the actions
       people can take to protect their lives and property.
     * Collection, Analysis, and Distribution of Water-Related
       Information. Collect, analyze, and interpret data on reservoir
       levels, water content in the snowpack, river and stream runoff,
       ground water levels, and precipitation. Distribute these data to
       the media, water managers, and the scientific and technical
       communities.
     __________________________________________________________________

Goal 6: Serve Local Water Needs by Providing Technical Assistance

   The Department helps meet local water needs through technical and
   financial assistance, information collection and dissemination, and
   resources evaluation.

Strategies to Meet This Goal

   The Department, with staff at headquarters and in four districts (the
   Northern, Central, San Joaquin, and Southern), provides statewide
   technical and financial assistance to local entities, as well as to
   other State and federal agencies. It helps meet local water needs in
   the following ways:

     * Providing Technical Assistance. Communicate regularly with local
       water entities to identify demand management and supply
       augmentation measures which the Department provides with its
       authority and funds. Offer a broad range of technical expertise to
       local water suppliers and users on water management problems.
       Gather and publish statewide data on surface and ground water
       quality and quantity, land and water use, and climate.

     * Conducting Water Resources Investigations. Cooperate with State,
       federal, and local agencies in studies to develop, manage, and
       protect water supplies.
     * Supporting Local Projects. Administer and manage loan and grant
       programs designed to make more efficient use of surface and ground
       water resources and to restore and enhance environmental resource
       values.
     * Encouraging Water Conservation. Work with local agencies to
       develop, implement, and refine water conservation programs that
       contribute directly to meaningful improvements in water use
       efficiency in urban, agricultural, and environmental settings.
     * Promoting Water Reclamation and Use of Recycled Water. Help local
       agencies coordinate their activities. Provide public education
       opportunities. Help local agencies with the regulatory process, and
       offer guidance on appropriate legislative opportunities. Work with
       local water supply and waste water agencies to integrate plans to
       recycle water with other urban and agricultural water management
       plans.
     * Promoting Conjunctive Use of Ground and Surface Water. Help local
       agencies evaluate effective joint management and use of
       California's extensive ground water basins and surface facilities
       to help meet water needs.
     * Facilitating Voluntary Water Transfers. Assist local agencies in
       the voluntary transfer of water while ensuring that the water
       planned for transfer actually exists, is transferable, and is the
       rightful property of the sellers. Assure that transfers do not harm
       fish and wildlife resources, cause overdraft, or degrade water
       supplies.
     * Operating a State Drought Center and Water Bank. Establish a
       drought center and drought water bank during drought years to
       improve water supply reliability.
     * Encouraging Effective Land Management Practices in Drainage Problem
       Areas. Establish and implement a land retirement program in
       drainage-impaired areas. Provide local agencies with technical
       assistance on drainage problems.
