                               2.4 Query Tutorial

   The Query component provides two query matching options, magnetospheric
   region occupancy and magnetic field line conjunctions. The user can
   specify up to nine conditions under which a single query may be made. A
   condition consists of satellite selections, region specifications, and
   field line tracing options.

   PLEASE NOTE that the current condition number and the totoal number of
   conditions entered is located at the top of the command menu. The trace
   model selection, as well as the start and stop times, are used
   throughout all conditions.

   The first screen of the Query Interface requires selection of at least
   one satellite for processing from a scrolling list of available
   satellites, selection of whether all the satellites or any number of
   them must meet the conditions to be specified, and entry of the start
   and stop times for satellite processing.

   As shown in the figure above, three satellites have been chosen, and a
   time range identified.

2.3.1 Condition Selection

   The Conditions section determines how conditions will be processed.
   Selecting "This condition", will enable processing of only the current
   condition as indicated by the condition number. Selecting "All" will
   process all conditions (up to nine) entered during the current session
   and is equivalent to a logical `and' between conditions. It displays
   results when All conditions are met. Selecting "Any" will process all
   conditions that meet the specified criteria and is equivalent to a
   logical `or' between conditions. It displays results when one or more
   conditions are met.

    Query Parameters Screen

   The Query Parameters Screen displays the primary fields for specify the
   query criteria. At the top of the screen two choices to identify which
   magnetospheric regions the satellites must occupy for inclusion in
   output processing. Alternatively, the user may choose to ignore the
   regions. This is useful if trace criteria have been entered and region
   criteria are to be ignored for the current condition.

   Meet ALL Region Filter groups (AND)
          Each satellite must be in the same selected region to be
          included in the output.

   Meet ANY Region Filter groups (ANY)
          The satellite(s) may be in any of the selected regions to
          provide a conjunction.

   Ignore Region Groups
          region query testing is not performed.

   As shown in the previous figure, "Any Region" has been chosen.

   Once the Same or Any option is determined, one or more magnetospheric
   regions must be selected.

   [Qscreen3.gif]

   The Region Selection options are located beneath the region occupancy
   field. This area displays the magnetospheric regions and mapped regions
   available for satellite occupancy testing. Mapped regions are
   subregions which correspond to areas on the Earth's surface into which
   field lines from the satellite's orbital position traces.

   As shown in the above figure, the choice of 'All regions' was made.

   At the bottom of the screen are located the Trace Setup fields.

   [Qscreen4.gif]



   The Trace Setup option is a series of pull-down menus for selecting
   conjunction conditions, trace direction, B-field model, and output
   format.

   Regardless of the conjunction condition, specify the trace direction or
   hemisphere as either down to the same hemisphere as the satellite,
   either/both hemispheres, opposite hemisphere, northern hemisphere or
   southern hemisphere.

   The Ground Station Selection is a page that when selected enables the
   query to perform a conjuction of the ground station area as a box
   centered on the ground station of a given latitude and longitude in
   either the GEO or GM coordinate systems. A great circle distance in
   kilometers may also be selected.

   [Qscreen5.gif]

   As shown in the figure above the ground station selection screen
   displays a scrolling list of ground stations. The list will allow you
   to select as many names as you like however only the first four
   selected will be applied to your query. If you would like to change the
   information for a ground station, change the default box size (10
   degrees lat, 3 degrees long) or radius (400 km) you need to select the
   appropriate ground stations and access the "Edit/Add Ground Station"
   page.

   [Qscreen6.gif]

   As shown in the figure above the "Edit/Add Ground Station" page allows
   you to modify information about a selected station or to add new ground
   station information. The user is limited to 3 new ground stations on
   each visit to the page.

   To summarize the step for selecting ground stations for a conjuntion
   are as follows:
    1. Select the ground stations that are of interest.
    2. Select either box or radius for the conjunction.
    3. Select the "Edit/Add Ground Station" button in the command menu.
       (Optional)
    4. Edit the fields of interest or add your own ground station.
       (Optional)
    5. Return to the "Ground Station Selection" screen to confirm your
       selections. (Optional)

   The list of available ground stations and their locations is given in
   Appendix D.


   As shown in the previous figure, the selection of Lead Satellite was
   made.

   [Qscreen7.gif]

   The Lead Satellite option is a scrolling list that displays the
   satellites chosen for the query, all of which are eligible to be lead
   satellites. It also displays the conjunction area and data entry fields
   for delta latitude and longitude. In order to use this option, at least
   two satellites must be selected for processing, at least one of which
   must be selected as the lead satellite (in the lead satellite selection
   field). The conjunction area coordinate system and the size of the area
   are also entered in this field.


   As shown in the above figure, the satellites selected on the main
   screen are listed here for selection as lead satellites. Next select
   the "B Field Models" from the command menu to go to the page for B
   Field Model options.

   [Qscreen8.gif]

   The B Field Model option is a page for entering internal and external
   trace model options. There are several internal and external
   magnetospheric models available from which to choose. Tracing is
   projected straight down to the Earth from the stop trace altitude.

   Appendix A includes descriptions of all internal and external field
   models used in SSC programs.


   [Qscreen9.gif]

   The Output Format option is a page that displays a checklist for both
   subsatellite coordinate system and trace coordinate system.

   Data for all satellites which satisfied the query is displayed. For
   example, a user selects five satellites and specifies ANY 2 in the
   select box. If only three satellites meet the region criteria (no trace
   criteria specified), then only those three satellites are displayed.




   [Qscreen10.gif]



   The Output Setup window allows users to designate where the output will
   be sent. Output may be sent to the screen, to a file or both. Output
   sent to the screen is sometimes too wide to be displayed. If output is
   wider than the screen, right/left shifts allow for shifting within the
   output window. Horizontal and vertical scroll bars are also available
   for scrolling through the output. If output is sent to a file, the user
   must specify a file name and may modify the number of lines per page of
   output.


   The Formats & Units button will allow the user to specify formats of
   time and degrees latitude and longitude, units for distance, and the
   number of decimal places.

   The Formats & Units button will allow the user to specify formats of
   time and degrees latitude and longitude, units for distance, and the
   number of decimal places.

   The Input Summary option on the Query Processor Main Menu screen allows
   users to view their selections prior to executing a query. An output
   summary is available for both screen and file outputs. File output
   summaries precede the actual output within the same file.

   The Execute button will execute the query. While the output is being
   processed a window will display the percentage of processing currently
   completed.

   A search capability is available through most browsers that allows
   searches through the output for specified character strings. This
   option will most likely be under the "Edit" menu.
