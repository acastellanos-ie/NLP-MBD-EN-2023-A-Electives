     Keep California
     Beautiful





   Californians bought more than 16 billion carbonated and non-carbonated
   drinks in aluminum, glass, plastic and bi-metal containers last year.
   More than 10 billion of those containers were recycled, saving natural
   resources, conserving energy and extending the life of our landfills.
   Imagine what well accomplish if we recycle the other six billion!

   The Department of Conservation, Division of Recycling administers the
   California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act (Act)
   enacted in 1986. The primary goal of the Act is to achieve and maintain
   high recycling rates for each beverage container type included in the
   program. The Division provides a number of services to achieve these
   goals, including enforcement, auditing, grant funding, technical
   assistance and education.

   Consumers pay CRV (California Refund Value) when they purchase
   beverages from a retailer and are reimbursed when they redeem the
   container at a recycling center.
