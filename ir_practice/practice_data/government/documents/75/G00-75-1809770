   programs for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad
   Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. These

   disability, death or temporary unemployment and sickness. The Railroad
   Retirement Board also administers aspects of the Medicare program and
   has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act and
   the Internal Revenue Code.

     In carrying out its mission, the Railroad Retirement Board will pay
   benefits to the right people, in the right amounts, in a timely manner,
   and safeguard our customers trust funds. The Railroad Retirement Board
     will treat every person who comes into contact with the agency with
   courtesy and concern, and respond to all inquiries promptly, accurately
                                and clearly.
