                                 VCCTL FAQs
     __________________________________________________________________

   1) I created a first graph or gif image using VCCTL, changed a few
   parameters and resubmitted the task. But, the graphs and/or gif images
   appear to be the same as in the first run. Why is this?

   Some WWW browsers do not update gif images if they already exist in
   their cache. The surest way to remedy this problem is to exit the WWW
   browser and restart it from the operating system (then reperform the
   task). Pressing the reload button on your WWW browser may also bring up
   the new gif graph from the VCCTL system.

   2) I attempted to perform a simulation with a certain gypsum content,
   but when calculating the number of one-pixel particles of gypsum to add
   to the 3-D microstructure before hydration, the one-pixel worksheet
   returned a negative integer for the number of gypsum pixels to add.
   What should I do about this?

   Because gypsum (or hemihydrate or anhydrite) is added as complete
   particles during the particle placement phase, occasionally (on a
   random probability basis), a very large particle of gypsum will be
   added to the 3-D microstructure and the gypsum content will be much too
   high even if no further particles of gypsum are added to the system.
   The user should first try to repeat the execution of menu selection #3)
   Generate an initial 3-D microstructure with a different random number
   seed to see if this alleviates the problem (and giving a new name for
   the created image). The actual gypsum fraction of the generated 3-D
   microstructure can then be checked using menu selection #9) Compute
   spatial statistics for a 3-D microstructure. If repeated changes of the
   random number seed are to no avail, the next solution would be to
   reduce the requested gypsum volume fraction input into the particle
   generation form (by say 0.005) to hopefully reduce the overall gypsum
   content in the generated initial 3-D particle microstructure.

   3) Is there any way I can see which parameters I used for a specific
   hydration run, after the run has completed?

   With each hydration run, a parameter file is created and stored on the
   system. It has the general name image.par.nnnn.tt.xyz where image is
   the name of the image file being hydrated, nnnn is the number of
   hydration cycles, tt is the starting hydration temperature in degrees
   Celsius, x is the conversion of primary C-S-H to pozzolanic C-S-H
   (prohibited=0, allowed=1), y is the thermal curing selected
   (isothermal=0, adiabatic=1, temperature-defined=2), and z is the
   initial saturation for curing (saturated=0, sealed=1). The user may
   view this file through their WWW browser by specifying
   http://ciks.cbt.nist.gov/~vcctl/data/image.par.nnnn.tt.xyz with the
   appropriately substituted values for image, nnnn, tt, and xyz.

   4) Is there any way I can access the output datafiles from a hydration
   run to graph them using my own plotting/spreadsheet program?

   With each hydration run, a set of datafiles are created and stored on
   the system. They have the general name image.dft.nnnn.tt.xyz where
   image is the name of the image file being hydrated, dft is the datafile
   type (pha for phases, chs for chemical shrinkage, heat for heat release
   data, adi for adiabatic heat signature, etc.), nnnn is the number of
   hydration cycles, tt is the starting hydration temperature in degrees
   Celsius, x is the conversion of primary C-S-H to pozzolanic C-S-H
   (prohibited=0, allowed=1), y is the thermal curing selected
   (isothermal=0, adiabatic=1, temperature-defined=2), and z is the
   initial saturation for curing (saturated=0, sealed=1). When the user
   submits their hydration run, the VCCTL returns a detailed listing of
   these files which will be created by the VCCTL (the user could print
   out this page through their WWW browser for later reference). The user
   may view (and download) this file through their WWW browser by
   specifying http://ciks.cbt.nist.gov/~vcctl/data/image.dft.nnnn.tt.xyz
   with the appropriately substituted values for image, dft, nnnn, tt, and
   xyz. Once viewed, the file may be saved using the Save as option on the
   WWW browser File pulldown menu.

   5) Is there any way I can create an animation of a hydration?

   At the end of the hydration menu selection form, there is a place to
   enter the number of slices to include in an animation file during the
   ongoing hydration. The default value for this selection is 0,
   indicating that no movie file will be created. The microstructure
   slices (from the middle of the model microstructure volume), will be
   stored in a file of the form newcem.mov.4000.25.000. After the
   hydration is complete, this filename can be entered in menu selection 5
   to create the actual animated gif file illustrating the progress of the
   hydration. As usual, this animated gif file can be viewed using menu
   selection 6 from the main VCCTL Menu.
