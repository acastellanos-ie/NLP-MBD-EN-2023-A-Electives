   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

   Where do scientist officers work in the Public Health Service (PHS)
   Commissioned Corps?

   The approximately 260 officers in the scientist category of the PHS
   Commissioned Corps work throughout the Department of Health and Human
   Services (HHS) and in other Federal agencies/programs.  The majority of
   scientist officers are assigned to the following:
     * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(44%);
     * Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(21%);
     * National Institutes of Health (NIH) (9%);
     * Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)(6%); and
     * Bureau of Prisons (BoP) (5%).

   What are the entry requirements?

   You must:
     * be a U.S. citizen;
     * be under 44 years of age (age may be offset by prior active-duty
       Uniformed Service time and/or civil service experience in a Public
       Health Service agency at a PHS site at a level commensurate with
       the duties of a commissioned officer);
     * have served less than 8 years of active duty if you are/were a
       member of another Uniformed Service (click here to access the
       Former/Current Uniformed Service members section);
     * meet medical requirements; and
     * pass an initial suitability investigation.

   In addition, you must have earned a doctorate (a Ph.D., D.P.H., D.Sc.,
   or Ed.D. is acceptable if the degree requirements included successful
   completion of independent and original research in the specialty
   field).  If you have completed all requirements for the degree but have
   not yet obtained your diploma, a statement from the graduate school
   dean will be accepted in lieu of the degree.  The document should state
   that you have completed all requirements for the doctorate and that the
   degree will be awarded at the next appropriate convocation to be held
   at a stipulated time.  If the qualifying doctoral level degree is in
   any of the professions requiring licensure, a current, unrestricted,
   and valid license in any of the 50 States, Washington D.C., the
   Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands or Guam is also
   required (recent graduates are an exception).

   What if I just graduated from a doctorate program and I don't have my
   professional license yet?  May I still apply?

   Yes, you may.  If you graduated from an accredited program within a
   year from your call-to-duty date, you may be appointed to the
   Commissioned Corps for a limited tour of duty not to exceed one year.
   Evidence of licensure is required for removal of the limitation and for
   retention in the Corps.

   In the specific case of Clinical Psychologists with a Ph.D., up to 3
   years are allowed for a licensure-limited tour due to the different
   state requirements for licensure.  The hiring agency must submit a
   request for the specific length of limitation in the form of a memo
   accompanying their request for personnel action (PHS-1662).

   How much will I earn?

   Compensation varies, depending on factors such as grade/rank, years of
   training and experience (T & E) in your profession, base pay entry date
   (BPED), geographic location of your duty station, and dependency
   status.  The minimum starting pay grade/rank for a scientist officer in
   the PHS Commissioned Corps is O-3 (LT).  T & E credit is determined by
   undergraduate education, graduate training, and experience considered
   to be professionally qualifying for appointment to the particular
   category.  It is earned for time spent after receipt of the qualifying
   degree in degree-related activities.  This could be:
     * employment (paid or volunteer)
     * research
     * further training in your field
     * teaching at college or university level
     * allied and relevant graduate studies and/or research

   What professional groups are available in the Commissioned Corps?

   You are encouraged to find out more about the Scientist Professional
   Advisory Committee (SciPAC).  The SciPAC exists to provide advice and
   consultation to the surgeon General on issues related to the
   professional practices and personnel activities of all PHS scientists.
   The SciPAC also provides advisory assistance to the Chief Scientist
   Officer and to the agency and/or program heads where scientist officers
   work.  All members of the scientist category may express their concerns
   and voice their opinions through the SciPAC.  The current members
   represent a cross-section of interests, professional experiences and
   responsibilities.  The more scientists who contribute to PAC projects
   and activities, the more representative the products and policy
   recommendations will be.  If interested in joining, contact the SciPAC
   Chairperson, CDR Richard Troiano at (301) 435-6822 or
   troianor@mail.nih.gov.

   You are also encouraged to join the
   Commissioned Officer Association (COA), the only professional
   association specifically representing the PHS Commissioned Corps.  In
   addition to being a "voice on Capitol Hill", COA offers its members a
   range of services, including a strong professional network, financial
   services, and an annual scientific meeting.  The annual meeting,
   usually held in late spring, is an excellent opportunity to meet
   colleagues from other agencies/programs, to exchange scientific and
   career information, and to earn continuing education credits.  For
   membership information, please call  (301) 731-9080 or visit COA's web
   site at www.coausphs.org.
