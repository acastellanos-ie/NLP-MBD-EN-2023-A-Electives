   California Department of Food and Agriculture
   Specialty Crop Block Grant


   In September, Congress passed the $5.5 billion Emergency Agricultural
   Assistance Act of 2001 that allocated almost $64 million to California.
   Of these funds, $500,000 is designated as a base grant to "support
   activities that promote agriculture." Further, federal legislators from
   the California delegation intended that $12 million be used for market
   development (such as support for Governor Gray Davis' new "Buy
   California" effort). The remainder is to be used to assist growers of
   specialty crops (which do not, by federal definition, include grains or
   cotton). The funds were provided in addition to State funds already
   used to support agriculture.

   CDFA and other states have asked for additional guidance on the
   expenditure of these funds from Congress and the Secretary of the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture (USDA). States have been given considerable
   flexibility, but Congressional members and the USDA stressed the need
   to support projects or activities that bring long-term benefits to
   agriculture (typically by reducing production costs or increasing
   markets.) Examples of these programs include food safety, nutrition,
   agricultural education, water and energy conservation, environmental
   concerns, market development, trade policy, new technology, minor crops
   research, and pest and disease prevention.

   The principle aim of the block grant program will be to provide rapid
   and tangible benefits to agriculture in order to encourage more federal
   support for California's specialty crop growers, as needed. The
   Department will not determine the best uses for the block grant funds
   until listening sessions have been held with the specialty crop
   industry. A series of at least five public listening sessions will be
   held in the month of October to solicit input from the grower community
   on specialty crop needs and existing state or private programs that
   have provided acknowledged benefits. The results of this block grant
   program have the potential to benefit not only the agricultural
   community, but the state's overall economy, environment and public
   health.
