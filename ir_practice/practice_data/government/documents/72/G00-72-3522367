   For those of you unfamiliar with the billing on Web PACER systems, we
   wish to warn you that if you search for cases based on a party name,
   the resulting list of matching names is billed to your account. For
   example, if you search for the name "Smith" and get 3,000 matching
   names on a 100 page list, you will be billed $.07 (seven cents) per
   page. Keep that in mind when you do a name search.

   Any questions of a billing nature should be directed to the PACER
   Service Center
   at the link below or by calling 1-800-676-6856.
