Bio Research
     __________________________________________________________________

             Research in the Biosciences division is aimed at defining the
     biological and medical hazards to humans from energy technologies and
        new energy options.  The division is organized into two scientific
   sections, Biophysics and Functional Genomics, plus a Structural Biology
   Center that operates two beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source.  Each
         section is comprised of several research groups with considerable
                                   interaction occurring among the groups.

Biophysics

   The goal of biophysics is to understand life processes in terms of
   organic and physical chemistry. Our research spans a broad spectrum of
   biological investigation, including protein structure and conformation
   studies, macromolecular interactions, molecular modeling, and protein
   engineering.  The majority of the work is tailored toward a broader
   understanding of structure and function relationships in proteins using
   a wide-variety of state-of-the-art techniques.

Structural Genomics

   Structural genomics attempts to provide the link between the vast
   amount of genomic sequence data that is being generated and the
   structure of the proteins which these genomes encode.  The eventual
   goal of the project is to obtain a complete database of unique folds in
   proteins such that we will have the ability to predict the
   three-dimensional structures of all proteins from their gene
   sequences.  There are many steps in this process and we are attacking
   the majority of them in new and efficient ways in the Biosciences
   division, including the use of high-throughput methodology (robotics
   and MAD-phased structure determination).   Continue on for more
   information regarding:
     * the selection of gene sequence targets,
     * the cloning and expression of target polypeptides,
     * the crystallization of purified protein by robots,
     * x-ray data collection at the SBC
     * structure determination of MAD-phased data sets,
     * and a "structural genomics" understanding the resulting structures.

Structural Biology

   Structural Biology is specifically concerned with determining a
   macromolecule's structure and how that structure dictates its
   function.  This field is the glue which links structural and functional
   genomics. The primary goals are in discovering the
     * folding patterns of a protein,
     * final three-dimensional structure of the biomolecule,
     * physical mechanisms of biological function,
     * and inter-molecular dynamics within and between complexes.

   The Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory provides an
   invaluable tool for the Structural Biology Center within the
   Biosciences division.  We encourage you to browse our structural
   biology efforts within the Biosciences Division at ANL.

Functional Genomics

   Despite the ability to determine a gene's sequence, and (possibly) the
   resulting protein's structure, the relationship of the sequence and
   structure to the biological function is more elusive. Functional
   genomics aims to determine how genes and their products work and are
   regulated.  Functional genomics is an another area of research which is
   helping to unlock the potential offered by genome sequencing data.
   These efforts both benefit from and contribute to structural genomics
   efforts.
