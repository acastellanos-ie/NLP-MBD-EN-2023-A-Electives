   Encroachment Permits



      Caltrans > Traffic Operations > Development Services > Encroachment
      Permits


      What we do:

        The use of California State highways for other than normal
        transportation purposes may require written authorization from the
        Department of Transportation. As the responsible Department for
        protecting the public's investment in the State highway system,
        Caltrans reviews all requests from utility companies, developers,
        volunteers, nonprofit organizations, etc., desiring to conduct
        various activities within the right of way. Such activities could
        include for example: construction of highway improvements, driveway
        installation and maintenance, highway landscaping and graffiti
        removal, commercial filming, special events such as parades
        commemorating an event, e.g. Independence Day.

        Requests for the right of way ingress are prepared on a Standard
        Encroachment Permit Application and forwarded to the district having
        geographical jurisdiction of the proposed encroachment site.
        Applications are available from each of the 12 Districts or this web
        site.

        Trenchless Technology

        Trenchless Technology encompasses many different technologies,
        Horizontal Directional Drilling, Microtunneling, Pipe Bursting, Jack
        & Boring are just a few.

        Trenchless Technologies have been beneficial in the relief of
        traffic congestion and detours due to utility and road construction
        projects, minimizing disruption to the traveling public, businesses
        and to property owners. This technology allows for the installation
        of utilities and communications without open cutting of roadways.

        Caltrans' involvement includes co-hosting of training seminars with
        the Industry's Organizations in providing information and training
        in safety in the operation of these technologies. The Office of
        Encroachment Permits is also responsible in the creating of the
        Specifications & Guidelines for Trenchless Technology work in State
        right-of-way.
