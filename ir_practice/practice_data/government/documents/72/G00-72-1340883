                                Transit Safety

     The goal of FTAs Safety and Security Program is to achieve the
     highest practical level of safety and security for all modes of
     transit. In order to protect passengers, employees, revenues, and
     property, all transit systems are encouraged to develop and
     implement a proactive system safety program plan. FTA supports these
     efforts by developing guidelines and best practices, providing
     training and by performing system safety analyses and reviews.

     On April 16, 1999, the FTA Administrator convened an
     interdepartmental task force of transportation professionals and
     safety experts to examine the Federal role in transit safety.
     Additionally, the industry, APTA, CTAA and the unions provided
     technical information on industry practices to the task force. The
     task force was charged with the development of recommendations in
     the areas of: operational best practices, human factors, and design
     standards.

     A companion document, Keeping Safety on Track, translated these
     recommendations into 6 functional areas with associated actions.
     FTA's FY 2000 accomplishments and activities planned for FY 2001 are
     published in the FTA Safety Action Plan Accomplishments and the
     Future.
