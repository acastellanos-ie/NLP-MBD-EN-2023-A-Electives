What is the NSA?

   NSA Seal and Eagle

   The National Security Agency is the Nation's cryptologic organization.
   It coordinates, directs, and performs highly specialized activities to
   protect U.S. information systems and produce foreign intelligence
   information. A high technology organization, NSA is on the frontiers of
   communications and data processing. It is also one of the most
   important centers of foreign language analysis and research within the
   Government.

   Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) is a unique discipline with a long and
   storied past. SIGINT's modern era dates to World War II, when the U.S.
   broke the Japanese military code and learned of plans to invade Midway
   Island. This intelligence allowed the U.S. to defeat Japan's superior
   fleet. The use of SIGINT is believed to have directly contributed to
   shortening the war by at least one year. Today, SIGINT continues to
   play an important role in maintaining the superpower status of the
   United States.

   As the world becomes more and more technology-oriented, the Information
   Systems Security (INFOSEC) mission becomes increasingly challenging.
   This mission involves protecting all classified and sensitive
   information that is stored or sent through U.S. Government equipment.
   INFOSEC professionals go to great lengths to make certain that
   Government systems remain impenetrable. This support spans from the
   highest levels of U.S. Government to the individual warfighter in the
   field.

   NSA conducts one of the U.S. Government's leading research and
   development programs. Some of the Agency's R&D projects have
   significantly advanced the state of the art in the scientific and
   business worlds. NSA's early interest in cryptanalytic research led to
   the first large-scale computer and the first solid-state computer,
   predecessors to the modern computer. NSA pioneered efforts in flexible
   storage capabilities, which led to the development of the tape
   cassette. NSA also made ground-breaking developments in semiconductor
   technology and remains a world leader in many technological fields.

Who is the NSA?

   NSA employs the country's premier codemakers and codebreakers. It is
   said to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the United States
   and perhaps the world. Its mathematicians contribute directly to the
   two missions of the Agency: designing cipher systems that will protect
   the integrity of U.S. information systems and searching for weaknesses
   in adversaries' systems and codes.

   Technology and the world change rapidly, and great emphasis is placed
   on staying ahead of these changes with employee training programs. The
   National Cryptologic School is indicative of the Agency's commitment to
   professional development. The school not only provides unique training
   for the NSA workforce, but it also serves as a training resource for
   the entire Department of Defense. NSA sponsors employees for bachelor
   and graduate studies at the Nation's top universities and colleges, and
   selected Agency employees attend the various war colleges of the U.S.
   Armed Forces.

   Most NSA/CSS employees, both civilian and military, are headquartered
   at Fort Meade, Maryland, centrally located between Baltimore and
   Washington, DC. Its workforce represents an unusual combination of
   specialties: analysts, engineers, physicists, mathematicians,
   linguists, computer scientists, researchers, as well as customer
   relations specialists, security officers, data flow experts, managers,
   administrative and clerical assistants.
