     PRIVACY STATEMENT



                          HHS Privacy Policy Notice
                            (as of July 30, 1999)



     Thank you for visiting our SAMHSA (HHS) web site and for reviewing
   our Privacy Policy. Our policy is clear.

   We collect no information about you, other than information
   automatically collected and stored (see below), when you visit our web
   site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

   Information Automatically Collected and Stored:
     When you browse through any web site, certain personal information
   about you can be collected. We automatically collect and temporarily
   store the following information about your visit:

   the name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example,
   aol.com, if you are using an American Online account, or stanford.edu,
   if you are connecting from Stanford University's domain);

   the date and time of your visit;

   the pages you visited; and

   the address of the web site you came from when you came to visit.

   We use this information for statistical purposes only and to help us
   make our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated
   otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you.

   Personally Provided Information:
     You do not have to give us personal information to visit our web
   sites.

   If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself
   through an email message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain the
   information as long as needed to respond to your question or to fulfill
   the stated purpose of the communication.

   However, all communications addressed to the HHS Secretary or the HHS
   Webmaster are maintained, as required by law, for historical purposes.
   These communications are archived on a monthly basis, but are also
   protected by the Privacy Act which restricts our use of them, yet
   permits certain disclosures.


   Disclosure:
     HHS does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal
   information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or
   statute.

   Intrusion Detection:
     This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by
   various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are
   subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic
   to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
   otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement
   investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information
   from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.


   Systems of Records:
     Information originally collected in traditional paper systems can be
   submitted electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions and
   information updates about eligibility benefits. Electronically
   submitted information is maintained and destroyed pursuant to the
   Federal Records Act, and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy
   Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act
   system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided.
