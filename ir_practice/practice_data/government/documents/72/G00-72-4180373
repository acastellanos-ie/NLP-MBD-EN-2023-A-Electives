   The NIH is home to one of the largest neuroscience research centers in
   the world. Over 200 laboratories, originating from eleven different
   Institutes, conduct research in the basic, translational, and clinical
   neurosciences. Through scientific collaboration, Pre- and Postdoctoral
   Training Programs, jointly sponsored Seminar Series and Special
   Interest Groups, scientists at NIH contribute to a vital and growing
   neuroscience research community. This website represents an
   inter-institute effort to convey, on an NIH wide basis, the research
   being conducted in the neurosciences. The specific areas of
   neuroscience research represented within this site range over a broad
   spectrum within the biological sciences including biophysics, molecular
   and cellular neurobiology, synapses and circuits, neuronal development,
   integrative neuroscience, brain imaging and both neurological and
   psychiatric disorders.
