     * Cross-section data. Hadronic total and elastic cross sections vs.
       laboratory momentum and total center-of-mass energy.
     * Summaries of particle properties. The Particle Data Group plans to
       provide computer-readable versions of Summary Table information
       from the Review of Particle Physics.

     * A table of masses, widths, and PDG Monte Carlo particle numbers is
       produced around Summer of even-numbered years after production of
       the Review of Particle Physics. Documentation appears at the front
       of the data. (Updated August 18, 2000, corrected on April 17,
       2001).

     * Palm Pilot Products: Physical constants, astrophysical constants
       and particle properties are available in a new application (June 1,
       2000). The above table of masses, widths, and PDG Monte Carlo
       particle numbers is available as a MobileDB database (August 6,
       1999). These will be updated in fall 2000 for the 2000 Edition of
       the Review.

     * The PDG Monte Carlo particle numbering scheme is a particle
       numbering system for use in interfacing different Monte Carlo event
       generators and detector simulators. These have been updated for the
       2000 Edition of the Review.
