   The Office of State Review was created in July, 1990 to assist the New
   York State Review Officers in reviewing the decisions of impartial
   hearing officers concerning the identification, evaluation, program or
   placement of children who have, or are suspected of having, an
   educational disability.

   We have created this web site as a service to parents, boards of
   education, attorneys and other interested parties. Either the child's
   parents or the board of education may appeal to the State Review
   Officer from an impartial hearing officer's decision.

   Each year, the State Review Officers decide approximately 90 appeals.

   Our site contains:
     * The Appeals Process - An Overview with Sample Forms
     * How to Prepare and File an Appeal - Parts 275, 276 and 279 of the
       Regulations of the Commissioner of Education (the text of the
       Regulations which govern the appeals)
