   determining technical design specifications, and identifying system
   performance or problem areas. The following information is collected

     * User Client hostname - The hostname (or IP address if DNS is
       disabled) of the user/client requesting access.
     * HTTP header, "user-agent" - The user-agent information includes the
       type of browser, its version, and the operating system it's running
       on.
     * HTTP header, "referer" - The referer specifies the page from which
       the client accessed the current page.
     * System date - The date and time of the user/client request.
     * Full request - The exact request the user/client made.
     * Status - The status code the server returned to the user/client.
     * Content length - The content length, in bytes, of the document sent
       to the user/client.
     * Method - The request method used.
     * Universal Resource Identifier (URI) - The location of a resource on
       the server.
