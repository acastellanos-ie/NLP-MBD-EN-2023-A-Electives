   Drug Program

   DOT Order 3910.1C, implementing drug and alcohol testing, requires one
   hour of training on the effects of alcohol and drug abuse for all
   managers and supervisors. New employees, who are in covered positions,
   managers and supervisors will also be required to receive one hour
   training. RSPA's drug program also emphasizes alcohol/drug abuse
   education for all employees. Training in drug and alcohol abuse enables
   managers, supervisors and employees to:
     * identify behaviors that may indicate drug and/or alcohol abuse;
     * learn the physical and mental effects of drug and alcohol abuse;
     * become knowledgeable of the legal penalties of being charged with
       driving while under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol;
     * learn the rights and responsibilities of managers, supervisors, and
       employees under the drug testing program; and
     * access information, advice and referral for family members who may
       have problems with drug and/or alcohol abuse.

   WHAT IS EEO?

   EEO stands for equal employment opportunity. EEO is the concept that
   every person, regardless of their personal identifying factors - race,
   color, religion gender, national origin, age (40 or more years of age),
   disability status, sexual orientation, and complaint status - has the
   right to fully participate in every aspect of employment and to be
   afforded all of the same terms, conditions, and privileges of work. The
   EEO Program is the management tool by which the concept of EEO is
   implemented. The EEO Program is managed by the Office of Civil Rights.

   The objective of the EEO Program is to promote equal opportunity in
   employment and to identify and eliminate discriminatory policies and
   practices.

   PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION

   FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION against employees and applicants
   for employment on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national
   origin, age (40 or more years of age), and/or mental or physical
   disability. Federal law also prohibits restraints, interference,
   coercion, discrimination reprisal, retaliation against persons who
   actively pursue discrimination complaints or who act as their
   representatives or witnesses.

   FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION against persons with disabilities.
   It is the policy of the Federal Government to ensure equality of
   opportunity and full participation by persons with disabilities with
   regard to employment, use of public services, and telecommunications.
   Agencies are required to make reasonable accommodation to the known
   physical or mental disabilities of individuals. Building accommodations
   must comply with the standards set forth in the Americans with
   Disabilities Act of 1990 to ensure ready access to and use by persons
   with disabilities.

   DOT POLICY PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION against civilian employees or
   applicants for civilian employment on the basis of sexual orientation.
   Procedures for processing complaints of discrimination based on sexual
   orientation have been established and implemented.

   SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS UNACCEPTABLE behavior and should not be tolerated
   by anyone. Unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, or
   other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual
   harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly
   or implicitly affects an individuals employment, unreasonably
   interferes with an individuals work performance, or creates an
   intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

   INITIATING THE EEO COMPLAINT PROCESS

   To help eliminate barriers to equality of opportunity in all aspects of
   federal employment, a complaint system exists for those who feel they
   have been discriminated against because of race, color, religion,
   gender, national origin, age, disability status, sexual orientation,
   and/or the fact that you have participated in prior discrimination
   complaint activity.

   If you are a RSPA employee or an applicant for employment within RSPA
   and you believe that you have been discriminated against, based on one
   or more of the EEO factors identified above, you must contact (orally
   or in writing) a RSPA or any other DOT EEO Counselor. This contact must
   be within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory action or within 45
   days of acquiring knowledge of the action. Matters raised after the
   45-day time limit will be counseled by an EEO Counselor, although a
   formal complaint may later be rejected for untimeliness.

   The EEO Counselor will make an informal inquiry into the matter and
   seek a resolution of the matter on an informal basis within 30 calendar
   days after such contact is made - unless the time is extended. The EEO
   Counselor will not disclose your identity during his/her inquiry
   without your prior written approval. You may be accompanied,
   represented, and advised at all counseling interviews by a
   representative of your choice. You may also select Alternative Dispute
   Resolution (ADR) as an alternative means of resolving issues. Contact
   the RSPA Office of Civil Rights for more information and assistance on
   ADR. The EEO complaint procedure places a strong emphasis on reaching
   informal settlements at all stages of the process.

   Although you may believe that a particular individual discriminated
   against you, EEO complaints are filed against the agency, not against
   individuals. Those individuals named in your EEO complaint will be: (1)
   informed of your complaint allegations, (2) provided the opportunity to
   respond to the allegations, and (3) informed of their right to
   representation.
