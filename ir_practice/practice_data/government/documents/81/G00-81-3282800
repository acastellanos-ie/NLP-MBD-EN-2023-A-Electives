   The Center was established in 1968 as a research and development
   division of the U.S. National Library of Medicine in Bethesda,
   Maryland, USA. A Board of Scientific Counselors meets twice a year to
   review the research activities of the Center.

   We conduct active research and development for the broad purpose of
   improving health-care information dissemination and use. This involves
   a wide range of research activities and disciplines. Research staff are
   engaged in developing intelligent information storage and retrieval
   systems, conducting their research by drawing on a diverse set of
   scientific fields and methods. Current staff have backgrounds in
   medicine, computer science, library and information science,
   linguistics, cognitive science, education, and engineering. Research
   projects include digital library research, automated indexing
   techniques, vocabulary and thesaurus research, natural language
   processing, medical knowledge representation, image processing,
   database design, machine learning, expert systems, and computer-based
   learning. The Unified Medical Language System knowledge sources, the
   Visible Human data set, and MEDLINE data are important sources of
   knowledge for many of our experiments.
