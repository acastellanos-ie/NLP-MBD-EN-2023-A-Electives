   The Reason for the MODIS 250m Project

   [SanFrancisco.A2000072.1910.115x150.jpg] The project was initiated
   following a meeting of the EOS Interdisciplinary Working Group (1999)
   where it was requested that MODIS Land products be made available for
   the entire globe at 500m and 1km. The EOSDIS Project mandated limit on
   PI processing at 50% production for the first year (tied to the
   February 1996 baseline numbers for volumes and loads) had resulted in a
   decision by the MODLAND group to maintain full resolution products but
   to produce less than full global coverage of MODIS land data. In
   response to the IWG request, the MODLAND group developed a solution
   supported by Martha Maiden (ESIPS Manager) at NASA HQ for a rapid
   development of a PI-based processing and distribution system for the
   high volume MODIS 250m products, outside of the EOS Core System. The
   250m production system that has been developed has evolved as part of
   the MODIS PI processing system (MODAPS).

   The Rationale for the MODIS 250m Channels

   It was envisioned that data at this resolution would be used to assess
   sub-pixel variability at 500 and 1km, for example for identifying
   sub-pixel cloud effects and for scaling studies. Initial studies to
   explore the advantage of 250m data for change detection were undertaken
   during the design of MODIS (e.g. Townshend and Justice 1988). Two 250m
   channels were adopted to enable generation of simple vegetation
   indices. At the time of the discussions as to whether to include these
   higher resolution bands on MODIS,  the concept of sharpening bands had
   already been developed for the SPOT system and has subsequently been
   included in the Landsat 7 design. For the record, acknowledgement
   should be given to Piers Sellers as AM Project Scientist for helping to
   make the case for inclusion of this unique capability on MODIS. The
   impact on data volume of global coverage at 250m is large and remains
   an issue for the data system. MODIS marks the first of a new generation
   of moderate resolution sensors The Japanese GLI system which is
   currently under development, has included six 250m channels in its
   design. based on the experience gained with MODIS the case might be
   made for similar resolution sensors on the next generation of
   operational polar orbiters.

   [avhrrvsmodiscomparison300.jpg] Relevance to Global Change Issues and
   Remote Sensing Applications

   The MODIS 250m resolution data provide a major improvement in the
   spatial resolution over previous  coarse resolution sensors. The finer
   spatial resolution provides the basis for moderate resolution change
   detection and provides an intermediate step in a multi-resolution
   sampling system for use with ASTER and Landsat 7 data. The single date
   images on the right show a part of the Chesapeake Bay near Oxford,
   Maryland. The left hand image is from the AVHRR 1km, near- infrared
   channel (band 2), the image on the right is MODIS 250m, near- infrared
   (band 2). A marked difference in the detail is apparent with the small
   inlets and field patterns being clearly depicted at the 250m
   resolution. The 250m data offer a new tool for the study of Land Cover
   and Land Use Change. The 250m data also offer considerable potential
   for natural resource management, for example providing improved
   monitoring capability for agricultural and forest lands. Given the
   large data volumes most users of the 250m data will be working at the
   regional scale.
