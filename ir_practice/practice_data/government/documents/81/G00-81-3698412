                   Milk Matters Calcium Education Campaign

   Welcome to Milk Matters - a nationwide campaign dedicated to increasing
    calcium consumption among America's children and teens. Milk Matters
       focuses on educating people about the importance of calcium for
   building strong and healthy bones. The childhood and teen years are the
    most important times to get calcium to keep us healthy later in life.
    The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)
   sponsors this campaign to help make sure America's children grow to be
                         strong and healthy adults.

                       The campaign's simple message?
                     Calcium is critical to our health.
