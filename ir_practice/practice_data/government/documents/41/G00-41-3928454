                       Products and Services (CO-OPS)

   Maritime commerce has tripled in the last 50 years and is expected to
   continue to grow. As ships have grown larger, the relative water depth
   available to the ship to safely navigate has dramatically increased.
   Consequently, safe and efficient cargo throughput in U.S. ports and
   harbors depends on the precise knowledge of water depth, currents,
   winds, visibility, and density of the water. The types of coastal
   habitats that exist in specific locations is often determined by the
   dynamic water level and currents, and this, combined with the influence
   of waves, will determine the rate of erosion and subsequent wetland
   loss (or gain). Water temperature and salinity directly affect habitats
   and the species of aquatic plants and animals that live there, or can
   create stratified situations that may lead to anoxic conditions in
   bottom waters or toxic blooms at the surface. River (freshwater)
   discharge and meteorological forcing, particularly during storms, can
   have dramatic effects on ecosystems.

   [ports.jpg] PORTS is a decision support tool which improves the safety
   and efficiency of maritime commerce and coastal resource management
   through the integration of real-time environmental observations,
   forecasts and other geospatial information. PORTS measures and
   disseminates observations and predictions of water levels, currents,
   salinity, and many meteorological parameters (e.g., winds, atmospheric
   pressure, visibility, etc.) that are needed by the mariner to navigate
   safely. The objectives of the PORTS program are: to promote navigation
   safety, to improve the efficiency of U.S. ports and harbors, and to
   ensure the protection of coastal marine resources. PORTS real-time
   monitoring also provides an understanding of ecosystem processes. NOS
   technology and monitoring programs measure the effects among
   oceanographic changes, coastal habitats, productivity, and coastal
   ecosystems health. Real-time information quantifies physical conditions
   to describe, assess, and predict the results of human activities and
   natural processes that affect the overall health of our Nation's
   coastal habitats. The National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON)
   provides information on local rates of long-term relative sea-level
   rise (or fall) critical to understanding changes in and loss of coastal
   wetlands.



 Vision:

         A Nation where everyone has ready access to tide, current, water level,
         and other coastal oceanographic products and services required for
         informed decisionmaking.

 Mission:

         To provide the National infrastructure, science, and technical
         expertise to monitor, assess, and distribute tide, current, water
         level, and other coastal oceanographic products and services necessary
         to support NOAA's mission.

   The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)
   collects and distributes oceanographic observations and predictions to
   ensure safe, efficient and environmentally sound maritime commerce. The
   Center provides the set of water level, coastal current, and other
   operational oceanographic products required to support NOS' Strategic
   Plan mission requirements, and to assist in providing operational
   oceanographic data and products required by NOAA's other Strategic Plan
   themes. The Center manages the National Water Level Observation Network
   (NWLON) and a national network of Physical Oceanographic Real-Time
   Systems (PORTS) in major U.S. harbors.

   The Requirements and Development Division establishes observation and
   analysis requirements for CO-OPS, based on the assessment of
   user/customer needs. The Division also manages the Ocean Systems Test
   and Evaluation Program (OSTEP) and its associated test facilities. The
   Division develops new oceanographic measurement systems and techniques
   to improve the safety of marine navigation.

   The Field Operations Division (FOD) operates and maintains all
   oceanographic and Great Lakes observing systems required to meet
   CO-OPS' mission objectives. The Division ensures the continuous 24-hour
   operations of navigation and other real-time observing systems needed
   to support the protection of life and property. FOD also operates the
   Ocean Systems Test and Evaluation Facility (OSTEF) to support
   development efforts of the Requirements and Development Division and
   the Information Systems Division. FOD operates equipment to test and
   evaluate new observing systems, and develops software modules to
   support NOS mission objectives.

   The Products and Services Division ensures the quality of all data
   collected by CO-OPS, and produces/disseminates operational products
   from this data stream. The Division monitors the performance of all
   CO-OPS observing systems and reports discrepancies to appropriate
   Center personnel. The Division performs operational data quality
   control and data analysis; produces oceanographic products; manages the
   content of CO-OPS data and product delivery systems; develops Web page
   services; distributes real-time data to CO-OPS customers; produces and
   distributes CD-ROM products; provides information for matters such as
   litigation and boundary disputes; and designs new products and services
   to meet user needs.

   The Information Systems Division provides a variety of computer-based
   system and application support services to ensure the efficient
   operation of CO-OPS computing resources. The Division develops software
   for scientific and office automation applications, evaluates new, off-
   the-shelf hardware and software, performs Information Resource
   Management system planning, and manages data management systems and
   networks. The Division also sets standards and creates policy governing
   the access and use of CO-OPS computing resources.
