   The "TRMM Overflight Finder" page allows users to search for passes of
   the TRMM satellite near any location on the Earth. To run the TRMM
   Overflight Finder just enter a location (latitude and longitude), a
   start and end date, and a search radius, and then hit the "Search for
   Orbit(s)" button.

   Note that this site is now updated to provide predicted overflights at
   the new operating altitude of 402.5 kilometers. As of 8/24/01 a final
   fine tuning of the orbit was completed to arrive at the "top of the
   box" for the new target operating altitude (402.5 +/- 1.0 kilometer
   based on the mean semi-major axis relative to the Earth equatorial
   radius). Note the geodetic altitude above the oblate Earth varies
   between about 397 to 408 kilometers for this orbit.

   On 10/11/01, we updated our predicted fit for future orbits and we now
   expect our overflight prediction accuracy to be good for at least a few
   weeks into the future, although we are aware of miscellaneous
   fine-tuning to our model that should be accomplished (time permitting,
   pending other post-boost data quality assurance efforts). The accuracy
   discussion will be brought up to date to reflect our expected
   accuracies after further analysis.

   Note that the instrument swath sizes increase by about 15 percent with
   the altitude increase. This is implemented for the purpose of plotting
   by including a new swath shape model that is good for orbits around
   402.5 kilometers. This is applied for illustrating all orbits after
   midway through the boosts. Thus the swath edges drawn during the boost
   period have additional inaccuracy. These swath models are currently
   considered perhaps accurate to only 20 kilometers for the TMI edges
   (pending further review), but this accuracy is consistent with the aims
   of our overflight estimates, which is just for identification of orbit
   numbers where TRMM passes pass roughly within a given distance ranges
   of selected sites, and illustration of the approximate swath overlay.
   The geolocation in actual TRMM products is much finer, generally to one
   image pixel. Although pixel geolocation errors greater than one VIRS
   pixel (about 2.2 km) were encountered in the fifth week after the boost
   (and in rare brief events pre-boost), the pointing has since been
   improved and is expected to generally remain within a pixel in TRMM
   products.

   For past overflights, accuracy in the plots and tables at this web site
   are expected to be better than 20 kilometers, but for future overflight
   locations will be less accurate, as described with the overflight
   prediction accuracy discussion, which includes plots showing the latest
   trends and the date when historical data has been most recently
   updated.

   Some discussion of the patterns for the times of day of overflights is
   available to explain why the local times of overflight roughly change
   with a 46 day cycle. Also available is some discussion of how to use
   this information to find TRMM Overflights coincident with TERRA (EOS
   A.M.) or any other sun synchronous satellites.

   This page was developed by the TRMM Science and Data Information System
   (TSDIS). Questions about this web site and the overflight predictions
   can be directed by e-mail to Steve Bilanow or to Michael Hensley.
