                                  Asia Streams and Basins from the USGS HYDRO1K data set are now online
   as a map service.
   HYDRO1k is a geographic database developed to provide comprehensive and
   consistent global coverage of topographically derived data sets,
   including streams, drainage basins and ancillary layers derived from
   the USGS' 30 arc-second digital elevation model of the world (GTOPO30).
   HYDRO1k provides a suite of geo-referenced data sets, both raster and
   vector, which will be of value for all users who need to organize,
   evaluate, or process hydrologic information on a continental scale.
   More information on HYDRO1K is available on the web at
   http://edcdaac.usgs.gov/gtopo30/hydro/. You can view the Map Service
   online using the Asia HYDRO1K Web Map.
