       DTIN is a LANL managed project for information about unique
       technical and scientific capabilities at LANL as well as many other
       DOE labs. NIS has a number of capabilities and staff expertise
       profiles listed in DTIN as well as do most divisions in the Lab.
       DTIN is a major resource for development of collaborations and
       funding opportunities both within and outside the lab.
