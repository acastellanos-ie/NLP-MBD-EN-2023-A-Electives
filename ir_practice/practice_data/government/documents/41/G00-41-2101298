   Photon Migration Tomography

   Our approach to reconstruction of the optical properties of a medium
   from time-resolved Photon Migration Tomography employs two principal
   tecnical advances.

   The first is the use of a Boltzman transport model for simulation of
   photon migration. Under some circumstances this provides considerably
   better accuracy than simplified computational strategies, for example
   treating transport as a simple diffusion process.

   The other advance is the use of an adjoint differentiation technique
   that allows calculation of the derivative of the simulation results
   with respect to the assumed properties of the medium, in a time
   comparable to the computation of the transport model itself.  This
   allows the use of gradient descent techniques to update the medium
   model efficiently for use in iterative reconstruction schemes.
