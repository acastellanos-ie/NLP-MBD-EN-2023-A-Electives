Individual Counseling:

The SBDC also provides individual consulting to its clients and each client
can utilize from 4 to 12 hours of no-cost counseling with one of our business
consultants.  While many of our clients benefit from attending the training
sessions, there is still a great number of clients who prefer the individual
counseling to help them to work out any issues that they may be facing in
their business.  The individual counseling helps the consultants to make a
more profound analysis of the clientâ€™s business or of their business idea so
that a specific recommendation or referral can be provided.
