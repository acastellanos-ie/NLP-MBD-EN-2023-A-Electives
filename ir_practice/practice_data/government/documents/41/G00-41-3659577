   1.     Activities Reports-by River Forecast Centers. The assigned
   hydrologic responsibility of a River Forecast Center includes forecast
   procedure development and a certain amount of related research.
   Guidance for these functions comes from the Office of Hydrology's
   Hydrologic Research and Development Laboratory. For an effective
   exchange of technical ideas, regular reports are needed by the
   Laboratory from the RFC's. In addition, these reports will keep the
   Laboratory informed of progress and problems in the techniques
   development area and also serve to keep National Weather Service
   Central Headquarters, Regional Headquarters, and other RFC's advised on
   the status of such activities. The report will be submitted quarterly
   at the end of March, June, September, and December to the Regional
   Director with copies to the Associate Director, National Weather
   Service (Hydrology), each Regional Hydrologist, and each River Forecast
   Center.

   1.1     Contents. The activity report will include but is not limited
   to

   1.1.1     Forecast Activities. A brief summary of any special forecast

   activity, such as flash flood occurrences, forecast problems
   encountered and/or solutions applied, or unusual forecast conditions.

   1.1.2     Technical Activities. This portion of the report should be
   given special emphasis. Development of new forecasting procedures
   and/or revision of existing procedures should be reported. Solutions of
   problems that would be of interest to other RFC's should be described.
   Technical problems needing research should be reported so that
   follow-up discussions can be initiated between the RFC and the
   Hydrologic R&D Laboratory concerning the various aspects of the
   research requirements.

   1.1.3     Miscellaneous Activities. Reports of conferences held with
   representatives of other agencies, visitors to the RFC, and
   participation in inter-agency matters that relate to water resources.
   Changes in personnel will also be included.

   1.1.4     Planned Activities. Indicate projects, meetings, and
   procedure developments contemplated for the next quarter.

   2.     Annual Report of River Forecast Points. Each RFC will submit a
   list of  forecast points with the September activities report using the
   format shown in Exhibit E-60-1.

   3.     Annual Report of Operational Computer Programs. Each RFC will
   include a fiat of Operational Computer Programs available and a brief
   description of each program with the September Activities Report.

   4.     Man-Hours Summary. An accounting of man-hours by activities will
   be maintained at each RFC for Regional Headquarters and Weather Bureau
   Headquarters use when requested. The following format is recommended

           3.4    Short Courses and Seminars
           3.5    Application for Formal Training

   4.    Training of Foreign Nationals

   1.    Purpose. The purpose of  this chapter is to describe the
   different types of training that are available to Weather Bureau
   personnel and other ESSA employees that perform hydrologic duties. It
   also describes the hydrologic training provided by the Office of
   Hydrology for visiting foreign nationals.

   2.    On-the-Job-Training (OJT).

   2.1    Description. OJT begins the first day an employee reports for
   duty and continues throughout his entire career.

   2.2    Initial Training. Training starts with indoctrination and
   orientation. After these preliminaries and when the new employee
   understands the part he is to play in the Weather Bureau mission, he is
   given proper instructions on what to do and how to do it.

   Methods of initial training also include  understudy assignments (i.e.,
   having him watch the actual performance of   more experienced employees
   on the job.)

   2.3    Programs for Continued Training.  OJT may also be performed
   after the orientation phase through the use of one or more of the
   following programs:

   2.3.    Seminars and Visits. These are probably the most formal and
   highly organized modes of on-the-job training.  Examples are listed
   below:

     (a) RFC-RDO seminars
     (b) PRF-WBH seminars
     (c) RH-RFC visits
     (d) RDO-RFC visits
     (e) RH-RDO visits

   These events are normally planned in advance and often have specific
   objectives. The training function is combined with reports of status
   and progress, familiarization with procedures, announcements, plans to
   meet changing circumstances review of problems. and other operational
   items.

   2.3.2    In-House Training. Informal programs for on-station training
   include such subjects as computer applications to river forecasting,
   use of radar data for estimating precipitation, application of data
   from meteorological satellites to river forecasting. improvement of
   reporting networks, and adaptation of new methods.

   2.3.3    Review and Evaluation. After a major flood or important
   hydrologic events a review is made of the forecasts. This review
   includes the entire process: available data, communications, data
   analysis, and forecast dissemination. Special circumstances and
   problems are examined and opportunities are considered for improvements
   to the entire system.  Service users are commonly included in this
   review.

   2.4    Other Agencies Training. Other agencies have training centers
   which feature short courses on various hydrologic subjects. Among these
   are:

     (a) Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Training Center, Sacramento,
     California

     (b) Soil Conservation Service, USDA Training Center, Fort Worth,
     Texas

   Personnel from other agencies are occasionally accepted and detailed
   information is available through the Regional Hydrologist or the Office
   of Hydrology.

   3.    formal and Special Training. This category of training is divided
   into four major types: full-time residence, correspondence, Part-time
   courses, and short courses and seminars.

   3.1    Full-Time Residence.  A scholarship program of the ESSA-Weather
   Bureau will be described in the "ESSA Personnel Handbook for
   Supervisors." The program is largely subject-oriented, and subjects
   include hydrology and water resources development. Each year or so, the
   "Universities Council on Water Resources" publishes a catalog of
   "Graduate Studies in Water Resources," copies of which are filed at
   RFC's and Regional Offices. This catalog describes courses offered at
   each of about 50 institutions. Occasionally, other information is
   published on educational opportunities in hydrology, and is available
   at Regional Offices.

   3.2    Correspondence Courses in  Hydrology. Two college-level
   correspondence courses in hydrology are available at this time. One is
   given by the U. S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School in
   Washington, D. C. This is a 2-part course, 3 credit hours per part,
   which is recognized by the Civil Service Commission, and by some
   universities. Another basic hydrology course is being developed for
   meteorologists and meteorological technicians who have hydrologic
   responsibilities. It is planned as a 3-credit-hour correspondence
   course, to be administered by a university.

   A correspondence course titles "Hydrologic Services Course", which will
   cover the broad aspects of water management is available from the
   Office of Hydrology. It describes the hydrologic services available,
   who provides them, and the techniques of rendering these services to
   the public.

   Other correspondence courses pertinent to hydrology include
   mathematics, meteorology, computer methods, writing, management,
   physics, and engineering subjects. These courses are offered by many
   colleges and universities.

   3.3 Part-Time Residence Courses. At most cities, part-time courses are
   available in a broad spectrum of subjects, some of which, are mentioned
   in the previous paragraph. In Washington, D.C., the USDA Graduate
   School sponsors evening courses in hydrology.  These courses are
   usually taught by Weather Bureau hydrologists with assistance by
   experts from other agencies.

   3.4 Short Courses and Seminars. These activities cover a broad spectrum
   of subjects. They are available in most cities, with federal, industry,
   and university sponsorship. Examples include the following:

     a. AMS Weather Radar Conference, every 18 months, at selected
     cities, one week.

     b. Weather Radar Course, University of Miami, every sex months,
     four weeks.

     c. Numerous industry-sponsored conferences and seminars on computer
     technology.

     d. Seminars on use of data from meteorological satellites.

     e. One- to four-hour sessions on how-to-listen, telephone manners,
     and other communications subjects.

     f. One-day to two-week sessions on administration and management --
     applied psychology in interpersonal relationships.

     g. Rapid reading .

     h. Innumerable university short courses on any subject important
     enough to attract a class.

   3.5 Application for Formal Training. Individuals wanting to be
   considered for training should make application in accordance with
   current instructions (see "ESSA Personnel Handbook for Supervisors").
   Agency sponsored training may also be recommended by an employee's
   supervisor, or it may evolve as a part of an overall program for
   training a certain group of people.  Final selection of trainees is
   based on such factors as the pertinence of the training requested to
   the applicant's job, actual need for the specific training involved,and
   the employee's capability relative to other applicants.

   4.    Training of Foreign Nationals. In recent years, people from more
   than 40 countries have visited the Office of Hydrology and River
   Forecast Centers for training in hydrology. Some have stayed for as
   much as a year of formal training while others have stopped only
   briefly for information about Office of Hydrology activities and recent
   research.

   Most of this training of foreign nationals has been on an individual
   basis, amounting almost to tutoring. To facilitate this training a
   formal 18-week course, ''Hydrologic Analysis and Forecasting," starting
   in February of each year will be given when there are at least five
   candidates. This course will include five weeks of training at a River
   Forecast Center.

   1.    General

   2.    Definitions

                                  * * * * *

   1. General. A standard National Weather Service hydrologic terminology
   program is essential to avoid conflict in the interpretation of
   hydrologic products. Understanding of hydrologic terms across political
   boundaries will be beneficial especially when critical flood
   information is transmitted to the news media, public, and action
   agencies. Where major differences may occur an ROML should be issued by
   the regional headquarters.

   2. Definitions.

   Annual Flood -- The maximum discharge peak during a given water year
   (October 1 - September 30).

   Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) -- An index to soil moisture
   within a drainage basin.

   Backwater Flooding -- Upstream Flooding caused by downstream conditions
   such as channel restriction and/or high flow in a downstream confluence
   stream.

   Bankfull Stage/Elevation -- An established river stage/water surface
   elevation at a given location along a river which is intended to
   represent the maximum safe water level that will not overflow the river
   banks or cause any significant damage within the river reach.

   Breakup -- The time when a river whose surface has been frozen from
   bank to bank for a significant portion of its length begins to change
   to an open water flow condition. (The event is signaled by the breaking
   of the ice and often associated with ice jams and flooding).

   Catchment Area -- Whole area having a common outlet for its surface
   runoff (also see Drainage Area or Basin and Watershed).

   Crest -- The highest stage or level of a flood wave as it passes a
   point.

   Cubic Feet Per Second (CFS) -- A unit of measurement of discharge equal
   to streamflow of 1 cubic foot per second passed a given section -- also
   called second foot.

   Discharge -- The rate at which a volume of water passes a given point.

   Drainage -- Removal of surface and/or subsurface water from an area by
   gravity or pumping.

   Drainage Area or Basin -- Whole area having a common outlet for its
   surface runoff (also see Watershed and Catchment Area).

   Drought -- A period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged

   from the lack of precipitation to cause a serious hydrological
   imbalance.

   Drought Index -- Computed value which is related to some of the
   cumulative effects of a prolonged and abnormal moisture deficiency. (An
   index of hydrological drought corresponding to levels below the mean in
   streams, lakes, and reservoirs.)

   Flash Flood -- A flood which follows within a few hours of heavy or
   excessive rainfall, dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water
   impounded by an ice jam.

   Flash Flood Warning -- Flash flooding has been reported or is imminent
   -- take necessary precautions.

   Flash Flood Watch -- Flash flooding is possible within the designated
   watch area -- be alert.

   Flood -- Any high flow, overflow, or inundation by water which causes
   or threatens damage.

   Flood Plain -- The portion of a river valley that has been inundated by
   the river during historic floods.

   Flood of Record -- The highest observed river stage or discharge at a
   given site during the period of record keeping. (Not necessarily the
   highest known stage.)

   Flood Routing or Streamflow Routing -- Process of determining
   progressively the timing, shape, and amplitude of a flood wave as it
   moves downstream to successive points along a river or stream.

   Flood Stage -- An established gage height within a given river reach
   above which a rise in water surface level is defined as a flood. (It is
   based on historic data and usually set at a level where the river
   begins to overflow its banks or a potential hazard begans to occur due
   to high water).

   Flood Warning -- An advance notice that a flood is imminent or has been
   reported at a certain station or in a certain river basin.

   Flood Wave -- A rise in streamflow to a crest and its subsequent
   recession caused by precipitation, snowmelt, dam failure, or reservoir
   releases.

   Forecast Crest -- The highest elevation of river level, or stage,
   expected during a specific storm event.

   Glacier Dammed Lake -- The lake formed when a glacier flows across the
   mouth of an adjoining valley and forms an ice dam.

   Headwaters -- Streams at the source of a river.

   Headwater Statements -- Guidance on headwater conditions, such as basin
   rainfall amounts, required to produce bankfull stages at specific
   locations. Guidance is prepared by the River Forecast Centers for use
   by Weather Service offices and key local officials.

   Hydrograph -- A graph showing stage, discharge, or other property of a
   river with respect to time.

   Hydrologic Service Area (HSA) -- A geographical area assigned to
   Weather Service Forecast Office's/Weather Service Office's/River
   Forecast Center's that embraces one or more river basins.

   Jokulhlaup -- An Icelandic term meaning glacier dammed lake outburst
   flood (also see Outburst Flood).

   Local Flooding -- Flooding conditions over a relatively limited area.

   Lowland Flooding -- Inundation of low areas near the river, often rural
   but may also occur in urban areas.

   Main Stem -- The reach of a river/stream formed by the tributaries that
   flow into it.

   Major Flooding -- A general term indicating extensive inundation and
   property damage. (Usually characterized by the evacuation of people and
   livestock and the closure of both primary and secondary roads.)

   Minor Flooding -- A general term indicating minimal or no property
   damage but possibly some public inconvenience.

   Moderate Flooding -- The inundation of secondary roads; transfer to
   higher elevation necessary to save property -- some evacuation may be
   required.

   National Weather Service River Forecasting System (NWSRFS) -- A system
   of hydrologic data management and analysis techniques, hydrologic
   models, and display functions utilizing computer software which
   provides a common framework so that a wide variety of hydrologic data
   procedures and model can be used for river forecasting and other water
   management applications.

   One Percent Chance Flood (One Hundred Year Flood) -- Flood magnitude
   that has one chance in 100 of being exceeded in any future l-year
   period. The occurrence of floods is assumed to be random in time, or
   regularity of occurrence is implied. The exceeding of a 1-percent
   chance flood is no guarantee, therefore, that a similar size flood will
   not occur next week. The risk of experiencing a large flood within time
   periods longer than 1 year increases in a nonadditive fashion. For
   example, the risk of exceeding a 1-percent chance flood one or more
