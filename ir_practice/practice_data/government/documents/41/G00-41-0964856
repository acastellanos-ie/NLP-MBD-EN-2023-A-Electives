   Science Objectives

   As a major X-ray mission following Chandra, XMM-Newton, and
   Constellation-X, Generation-X will necessarily have a very broad
   spectrum of scientific objectives, from flares of stars in the solar
   neighborhood, to galactic star formation regions, compact objects,
   supernova remnants, accretion disks, to active galactic nuclei,
   quasars, clusters of galaxies, and to the large scale structures of the
   Universe. In this section we illustrate the need for 150 m^2 collection
   area using the study of normal galaxies and formation and evolution of
   quasars.

   Recent precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
   radiation have provided detailed quantitative verification of the
   inflationary big-bang cosmology. Now we know that fluctuations in the
   early (z ~ 1000) Universe existed with the expected amplitudes that
   would result in the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies and
   other large scale structures. In order to effectively study these
   aspects of the Universe, we need to be able to detect out to z = 10 the
   typical normal galaxy with an X-ray band luminosity, say, 2 x 10^40
   ergs/s (Fabbiano 1987), which corresponds to a flux of 2 x 10^-20
   ergs/cm^2/s. Such a galaxy would generate approximately 8 x 10^-3
   counts in Chandra in 10^6 s. In order for Generation-X to detect this
   source in the same 10^6 s, it needs to have an area that is at least
   1000 times that of Chandra, in other words, about 100 m^2. Taking into
   account the effect of redshift and the fact that photon fluxes decrease
   with energy in general, we will require Generation-X to have 150 m^2 at
   1 keV. This is equivalent to a 15 m in diameter aperture telescope.
   Such an area will enable spectroscopic studies of the same galaxy at z
   = 5 which would generate about 10^2 photons in 10^6 s. We note that
   this area is consistent with a set of minimal requirements arrived at
   from many different and detailed arguments (Elvis & Fabbiano 1996).

   Similarly, such an amount of effective area will facilitate studies of
   starburst galaxies and the formation and evolution of quasars. For
   example, to explain the existence of luminous quasars with a redshift
   of nearly 6, Haiman and Loeb (2000) have proposed that those quasars
   result from stellar-sized black holes (~ 10 solar masses) formed around
   z = 10 and accreting mass from their environment over the life time of
   the Universe to become a supermassive black hole (~ 10^9 solar masses).
   As such, over the entire life of those black holes, they would be
   powerful X-ray emitters. Detecting and studying them in the X-ray band
   and comparing their properties with other black holes in nearby
   galaxies will be extremely important to fully understand the origin and
   evolution of quasars.
