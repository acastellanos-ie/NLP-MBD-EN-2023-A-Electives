   Servlet Examples with Code

   This is a collection of examples which demonstrate some of the more
   frequently used parts of the Servlet API. Familiarity with the Java(tm)
   Programming Language is assumed.

   These examples will only work when viewed via an http URL. They will
   not work if you are viewing these pages via a "file://..." URL. Please
   refer to the README file provide with this Tomcat release regarding how
   to configure and start the provided web server.

   Wherever you see a form, enter some data and see how the servlet
   reacts. When playing with the Cookie and Session Examples, jump back to
   the Headers Example to see exactly what your browser is sending the
   server.

   To navigate your way through the examples, the following icons will
   help:

   [execute.gif] Execute the example
   [code.gif]    Look at the source code for the example
   [return.gif]  Return to this screen

   Tip: To see the cookie interactions with your browser, try turning on
   the "notify when setting a cookie" option in your browser preferences.
   This will let you see when a session is created and give some feedback
   when looking at the cookie demo.

   Hello World        [execute.gif] Execute [code.gif] Source
   Request Info       [execute.gif] Execute [code.gif] Source
   Request Headers    [execute.gif] Execute [code.gif] Source
   Request Parameters [execute.gif] Execute [code.gif] Source
   Cookies            [execute.gif] Execute [code.gif] Source
   Sessions           [execute.gif] Execute [code.gif] Source

   Note: The source code for these examples does not contain all of the
   source code that is actually in the example, only the important
   sections of code. Code not important to understand the example has been
   removed for clarity.
