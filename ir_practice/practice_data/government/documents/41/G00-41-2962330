           GOVERNOR DAVIS CALLS FOR UNITY AFTER ATTACK ON AMERICA

            Governor Also Encourages Californians to Donate Blood

   SACRAMENTO

   Governor Gray Davis called for calm and unity in the aftermath of the
   attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon Tuesday. In a statement
   recorded earlier, the Governor made the following comments:

   "This horrific massacre of innocent people will be seared into our
   hearts and minds forever. Californians have always united in times of
   crisis and we will do so again now. We are one people - one people with
   many faces. This is a time for coming together, not finger-pointing and
   scape-goating.

   "Law enforcement officials have told me that they are concerned about
   the possibility of reprisals - Californians raising hands against
   fellow Californians. I call on all Californians to remain calm. The
   federal government will bring to justice those responsible for these
   outrageous attacks on the American people.

   "May God bless the souls of our fellow citizens who were tragically
   killed yesterday. And may He bring peace and comfort to their loved
   ones."

   In addition, Governor Davis called for Californians to donate blood to
   local blood banks.

   "In this time of extraordinary tragedy, Californians are demonstrating
   remarkable courage and concern for their fellow Americans. Many of them
   want to help. Here's one way: the Red Cross is asking Americans to
   donate blood. I would urge all Californians who have the will and a way
   to donate blood to contact the American Red Cross at 1-800-GIVE-LIFE."
