   As part of its Information Assurance mission, the National Security
   Agency (NSA) has long been involved with the computer security research
   community in investigating a wide range of computer security topics
   including operating system security. Recognizing the critical role of
   operating system security mechanisms in supporting security at higher
   levels, researchers from the NSA's Information Assurance Research Group
   have been investigating an architecture that can provide the necessary
   security functionality in a manner that can meet the security needs of
   a wide range of computing environments.

   End systems must be able to enforce the separation of information based
   on confidentiality and integrity requirements to provide system
   security. Operating system security mechanisms are the foundation for
   ensuring such separation. Unfortunately, existing mainstream operating
   systems lack the critical security feature required for enforcing
   separation: mandatory access control. As a consequence, application
   security mechanisms are vulnerable to tampering and bypass, and
   malicious or flawed applications can easily cause failures in system
   security.

   The results of several previous research projects in this area have
   been incorporated in a security-enhanced Linux system. This version of
   Linux has a strong, flexible mandatory access control architecture
   incorporated into the major subsystems of the kernel. The system
   provides a mechanism to enforce the separation of information based on
   confidentiality and integrity requirements. This allows threats of
   tampering and bypassing of application security mechanisms to be
   addressed and enables the confinement of damage that can be caused by
   malicious or flawed applications.

   Linux was chosen as the platform for this work because its growing
   success and open development environment provided an opportunity to
   demonstrate that this functionality can be successful in a mainstream
   operating system and, at the same time, contribute to the security of a
   widely used system. Additionally, the integration of these security
   research results into Linux may encourage additional operating system
   security research that may lead to additional improvement in system
   security.

   This work is not intended as a complete security solution for Linux.
   Security-enhanced Linux is not an attempt to correct any flaws that may
   currently exist in Linux. Instead, it is simply an example of how
   mandatory access controls that can confine the actions of any process,
   including a superuser process, can be added into Linux. The focus of
   this work has not been on system assurance or other security features
   such as security auditing, although these elements are also important
   for a secure system.

   The security mechanisms implemented in the system provide flexible
   support for a wide range of security policies. They make it possible to
   configure the system to meet a wide range of security requirements. The
   release includes a general-purpose security policy configuration
   designed to meet a number of security objectives as an example of how
   this may be done. The flexibility of the system allows the policy to be
   modified and extended to customize the security policy as required for
   any given installation.

   There is still much work needed to develop a complete security
   solution. In addition, due to resource limitations, we have not yet
   been able to evaluate and optimize the performance of the security
   mechanisms. Currently, we can only support the x86 architecture and
   have only been able to test it on Red Hat distributions. Nonetheless,
   we feel we have presented a good starting point to bring valuable
   security features to Linux. We are looking forward to building upon
   this work with the Linux community.

   Security-enhanced Linux is being released under the same terms and
   conditions as the original sources. The release includes documentation
   and source code for both the system and some system utilities that were
   modified to make use of the new features. Participation with comments,
   constructive criticism, and/or improvements is welcome.
