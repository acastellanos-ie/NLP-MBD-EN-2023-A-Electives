  Reporting Occupational Radiation Exposure Data
     __________________________________________________________________

   DOE sites are required to submit the results of occupational radiation
   exposure monitoring to DOE Headquarters on an annual basis in
   accordance with DOE Order 231-1. The format and content of the reports
   are specified in DOE Manual 231-1.1 Appendix G.
     __________________________________________________________________

   REMedit Validation

   DOE M 231.1-1 is applicable for the 1999 monitoring data. One of the
   changes from the previous reporting specifications is the Monitoring
   Status codes. The codes are:
     * E - Employee (contractor or subcontractor)
     * G - Government, regulatory agency personnel
     * P - Member of the public
     * T - Terminated employee

   The REMedit software contains the old "employment status" codes from
   DOE Order 5484.1. REMedit will generate an error message for each
   record that contains an E, G, or P monitoring status code. At this
   time, a new REMedit code will not be generated to address this one
   change in reporting requirements. Sites that use REMedit are directed
   to ignore the monitoring status error messages once it has been
   determined that the proper codes are being used in accordance with M
   231.1-1.

   Sites are encouraged to continue using REMedit to validate the data and
   check for other errors or problems with the data submittals.
