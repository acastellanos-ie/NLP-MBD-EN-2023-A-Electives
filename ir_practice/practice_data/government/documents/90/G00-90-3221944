   Abstract We derive that the compression for any single shock has an
   upper bound of 7. This is in the case of shocking from any initial
   state except gaseous densities with temperatures such that a
   significant fraction of the electrons are bound. For shocks in
   condensed material initially near ambient, we present a simple analytic
   estimate for the maximum compression as a function of (initial
   density), A (atomic weight), Z (atomic number), and E (the o sum of
   cohesion, dissociation, and total ionization energies).
   __________________________________ Introduction For any material that
   is compressed by a shock wave, one might suppose that increasing the
   pressure of the shock wave to arbitrarily high values will produce an
   arbitrarily large compression. This is not true and in particular one
   can show that for infinitely strong shock waves in any substance there
   is a compression of exactly fourfold from the initial density in front
   of the shock to the final density behind the shock. Thus in defiance of
   the high pressure, the compression is limited by the high temperatures
   produced by shocks. For condensed materials shocked from near ambient
   the maximum possible compression attainable by a single shock is
   greater than four and occurs at some finite pressure, the particular
   values depending on the specific material and on the initial density
   and temperature. This overshot of the fourfold limit is caused by the
   "softening" of the material when energy is drained into internal
   degrees of freedom such as in ionization. In this note we derive from
   general arguments an upper bound on the maximum compression attainable
   by a single shock in any material from any initial state except those
   with gaseous densities and a significant number of bound electrons. We
   also obtain an estimate of the maximum compression in the case of
   condensed materials shocked from near ambient. An Upper Bound A
   Hugoniot is a curve in thermodynamic parameter space that is the
   collection of final states behind a shock as the strength of a shock is
   varied for fixed initial state. Hugoniots, along with isotherms,
   isobars, and isentropes, for example, are curves specified on the
   equation of state surface by constraints such as requiring that the
   temperature, pressure, or entropy is constant. It is just that the
   constraint for the Hugoniot is not as simple as keeping a standard
   thermodynamic variable fixed. For weaker shocks with little entropy
   production the Hugoniot is approximately an isentrope. For shocks with
   significant entropy production the Hugoniot in pressure-density space
   is stiffer than an isentrope. The principal Hugoniot is that one with
   ambient as the initial state [1]. Any Hugoniot is determined from the
   hydrodynamic equation of state P( ,E) and the energy jump constraint, 1
   E - Eo = (P + o P )(1/ o -1/ ) 2 . (1) 2 Here P is pressure, is
   density, and E is the internal energy per gram. P , , and E o o o
   represent the same but are for the initial state of the Hugoniot. We
   define the compression as = / and rewrite Eq. (1) as o = 4 + [2 (E - Eo
   )- ( 3 P + o P )]/(P + o P ) . (2) We now assume that the virial
   theorem is exact for the equation of state [2]; i.e., if E = K + U,
   where K is the average kinetic energy per gram and U is the average
   potential energy per gram, then P/ = 2K/3 + U/3. (We are considering
   here the case of physical interest, namely, the charge neutral, quantum
   Coulomb system.) Substituting into Eq. (2), we get = b - 3 o P (1+ )/(P
   + o P ) b , (3) where = 4 + (U - U )/(P + P ). If U U , then 4. If U U
   , then we rewrite b o o o b o Eq. (3) as b = 4 + 3/[1+ 2Ks /Us + 3 o P
   (1/ +1/ o )/Us] , (4) where K = K  K and U = U  U . s o s o For
   classical systems, K 0 because the average kinetic energy is linear in
   s temperature T. This is not the case in general for a quantum, charge
   neutral, bare Coulomb system. For low densities where atomic states are
   a good approximation for the electrons, the electrons ionize from
   localized high kinetic energy states to low kinetic energy extended
   free states. Thus the average kinetic energy drops as the temperature
   rises as long as there is a significant fraction of electrons remaining
   to be ionized. This is nothing more than the uncertainty principle with
   the electrons going from a small to a big box. The just discussed 3
   situation is not the case for densities higher than gaseous. There the
   electrons do not have an extreme change in localization in going from
   low to high temperatures. Thus for quantum systems, it is very
   reasonable that K 0 when U 0 if 7 - ( > 0) for a s s material shocked
   from densities greater than gaseous. (Models support this position.)
   Then from Eq. (4), 7. Thus we conclude that the compression along a
   single-shock b Hugoniot for any material cannot exceed 7 for a broad
   class of initial shock states. An Estimate for the Principal Hugoniot
   We now look to the principal Hugoniot, where P = 0. We assume that we
   are o shocking from T = 0. (The difference between zero and room
   temperature is small when we are looking for estimates of the maximum
   compression.) From Eqs. (3) and (4), we find that = 4 + 3 1 /( + 2Ks
   /Us) . (5) It is convenient to define Y = U /(2 E) where, for the
   principal Hugoniot, E = -E and is s o the sum of cohesive,
   dissociation, and total ionization energies. Then = (7Y + 4Ks / E ) /(Y
   + Ks / E ) . (6) From the exact high-temperature series for the
   equation of state of any elemental material [3], we obtain Y as an
   exact series in 1/K . (We are thinking of K as the s s independent
   variable.) All that we need is Y = 1+ a 1/2 + , (7a) 4 with a = -e3(1+
   Z)2(L/ ) A 2 / E (7b) and = 3 3 Z . (7c) o /(2Ks ) In these equations,
   L is Avogadro's number, and e is the electron charge. The a 1/2
   originates from the Debye-Hückel term in the high-T expansion. We
   substitute Eqs. (7a)-(7c) into Eq. (6) and solve for the maximum
   compression, . The result is m m = ( 4 1+ C 7 )/(1+ C 4 ) , (8a) with C
   = ( 2 E / Z)3 4 A 81 /[ 6 e 1 ( + Z)4 4 L o] . (8b) This is our
   estimate for the maximum compression along the principal Hugoniot.
   Equation (8b) can be simplified further if one neglects cohesive and
   dissociation energies. We fit to the total ionization energies of C. E.

   C 011 . 0 2 . 4 AZ /[ o 1 ( + Z)4] . (8c) Conclusions The estimates of
   Eqs. (8a)-(8c) and an upper bound of 7 are our results. The only
   existing data that is a strong test of our expression is for Al [5]. In
   that case 5, and m m that value agrees well with Eqs. (8). One has
   available more terms in the expansion Eq. (7a). We have extensively
   studied these terms and found that they do not influence our 5
   estimates at all. We have also extensively worked with the series Eq.
   (7a) using Padé approximants. Again there was no significant influence.
   We feel Eqs. (8a)-(8c) are a quite good approximation of .m In a
   previous discussion of the high pressure Hugoniot [6], we presented the
   relations s = 1 + /2 and = 1 + 2/ , where s is the derivative of the
   shock velocity with m respect to the particle velocity and = 1/ P/ E is
   the Grüneisen parameter. These relations are exact at any point on the
   Hugoniot where the density derivative of the pressure is infinite. The
   first is also approximately true for any given material over a very
   large region of the Hugoniot, including particle velocities from about
   10 to 100 km/s. In such a region it is universal that s 1.2 and thus
   0.4. It is above this very linear region that the Hugoniot becomes
   steeper and in pressure-density space attains maximum compression.
   There s will be a little larger than its value in the linear region.
   (We should clarify that there are two linear regions in the shock
   velocity-particle velocity Hugoniot. One is from 0 to about 3 km/s for
   the particle velocity and the other, which is the one of interest, is
   from about 10 to 100 or more km/s.) From our approximation of the
   maximum compression and the above two relations, we can obtain
   estimates of s and at the maximum compression point. The ultimate
   limiting values for shocks of infinite strength are = 4, s = 4/3, and =
   2/3. 6 References [1] For more discussion see, for example, J. O.
