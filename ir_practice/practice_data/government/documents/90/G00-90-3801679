   HEIGHTENED SECURITY CONTINUES AT THE ALBUQUERQUE INTERNATIONAL SUNPORT

   The Albuquerque International Sunport, along with all other U.S.
   airports, continues to operate at an enhanced level of security. The
   air transportation industry and traveling public are experiencing many
   changes. Stricter security measures are expected to continue
   indefinitely and will impose some constraints on passengers and
   visitors to the Sunport especially, during the upcoming holiday season.

   Sunport passengers and visitors should be aware of and follow these
   guidelines:
     * Give yourself some extra time and be patient. Every effort the
       airport and airlines undertake is in an effort to ensure that your
       travel is safe, secure and efficient.

     * Check directly with your airline before going to the airport. Make
       absolutely sure your flight has not been cancelled, rescheduled or
       delayed.

     * Allow plenty of time for check-in prior to your scheduled departure
       time. Anticipate longer lines at airline ticket counters, increased
       security screening and other potential delays. Your airline can
       advise you how much extra time to allow – many advise at least a
       2-hour advance time. Call your airline in advance for a
       recommendation.

     * Picture ID is absolutely essential for flight check in at the
       ticket counter and other locations prior to boarding your aircraft.
       Please be prepared to present your ID at the security checkpoint
       and at the gate area.

     * Only passengers with tickets or passengers who can produce
       airline-approved documentation will be allowed beyond the security
       checkpoint. If you are utilizing e-tickets or ticketless travel,
       please confirm with your airline what you will need at the
       checkpoint.

   Exceptions to this rule may be made for special circumstances such as
   parents escorting children or a need to accompany an elderly individual
   to the gate. Please check with your airline prior to reaching the
   security checkpoint for advice on how to best handle this situation so
   you avoid any unnecessary delays once you reach the checkpoint.
     * Family members, friends and others waiting on arriving passengers
       or accompanying departing passengers will have to stay outside the
       security checkpoint area. Meeters and greeters are no longer
       allowed access to the gate areas.

     * Sharp objects of any description, composition or length are
       strictly prohibited beyond the security checkpoint. This includes
       knives and scissors of any kind. Cutting objects such as box
       cutters and straight razors are not allowed past the checkpoint.
       Metal nail files, corkscrews, ice picks, letter openers, nail
       clippers with a comb knife, and screwdrivers are among other
       restricted items.

   If you happen to be carrying a restricted item and it is detected at
   the security checkpoint, you will be given the option of taking the
   item back to your vehicle or checking it at your airline ticket
   counter. If you choose neither of these options, the item will be
   collected by security screening personnel and cannot be returned.
     * New carry-on baggage restrictions allow only one (1) carry-on bag
       and one (1) personal item such as a purse, briefcase, or lap top
       computer per passenger. If you have more items than allowed, you
       will be asked to go back and check the extra items at the ticket
       counter.

     * The Sunport’s parking garage and long-term surface lots are OPEN.
       Expect some parking restrictions on the 3^rd and 4^th levels of the
       garage.

     * Unattended vehicles at the terminal curb on both the upper and
       lower level roadways will be cited and towed immediately – no
       exceptions.

     * Loading and unloading of passengers and baggage at the curb is
       permitted. However, waiting at the curb – in or with your vehicle –
       is not allowed. Airport Police and traffic security personnel will
       ask individuals who park and wait to move along. If you are picking
       someone up, you are strongly encouraged to park in the Sunport’s
       short-term parking garage if a wait of any length is anticipated.

   Please take time to check with your airline if you have any questions
   regarding flights, restricted carry-on items, carry-on baggage limits,
   or security checkpoint exception access requests. Local newspapers and
   TV news reports, along with this web site, can provide helpful,
   up-to-date information on new procedures and conditions at the Sunport.

   Please help us to make your travel experience as stress free and as
   pleasant as possible by following these guidelines. We are working hard
   to make air travel safe and efficient.

          FAA IMPOSES CARRY-ON BAGGAGE RESTRICTIONS AT ALL AIRPORTS

   Increased Security Measures and Heavy Passenger Traffic Causing Delays
                  at the Albuquerque International Sunport

   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today advised all U.S airport
   operators and airlines of an added security measure concerning carry-on
   baggage.  Passengers will now be allowed to carry on only one (1) bag
   and one (1) personal item such as a purse, briefcase, small backpack,
   or lap top computer. Previously, two carry-on bags and a personal item
   per person were allowed. The new restriction will be implemented
   immediately.

   At the Albuquerque International Sunport, lengthy lines at the security
   checkpoint have delayed passengers significantly, at times. Thorough
   searches of carry-on items at the checkpoint along with higher
   passenger volume have resulted in waits ranging from 15 minutes to an
   hour or more to clear security. Delays in processing passengers through
   the checkpoint vary during the day with peak periods occurring during
   the morning hours, early afternoon and again in the early evening.

   More than ever, airlines are emphasizing the need for passengers to
   allow plenty of extra time prior to flight departure. Additionally, the
   newest restriction limiting carry-on items must be followed with no
   exceptions. Passengers are being asked to check as much luggage as
   possible rather than carrying it on board the aircraft primarily, to
   reduce processing time at the security checkpoint and during the
   boarding process.  Furthermore, special attention should be paid to
   items that are restricted beyond the security checkpoint such as knives
   and scissors. If these items must be carried while traveling they
   should not be placed in carry-on bags but in checked luggage.
