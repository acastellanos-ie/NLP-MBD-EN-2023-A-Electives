   Web Privacy Policy

   Last revised: September 25, 2000

   Q. What information is collected about visitors to the NIDCD site?

   A. You can visit our web pages without telling us who you are. We
   collect statistics about how people access and use our site, but we do
   not identify you personally. We use this data only in the aggregate and
   analyze it as a whole. We also collect search terms to learn the topics
   that are of most interest to visitors using our search tools. These
   search terms are not associated with individual users.

   Q. How is the information used?

   A. To help us improve our site, we gather information about how it is
   used. We analyze this information by looking for usage trends rather
   than at individual visits. For example, we look at the total number of
   users and the parts of the site that are accessed most and least
   frequently. This information allows us to improve the way the site is
   designed, making it easier for you to find what you need.

   Q. How are e-mails to NIDCD used?

   A. When inquiries are e-mailed to us, we store the question and the
   e-mail address so that we can respond electronically. Unless otherwise
   required by statute, we do not publicly identify people who send
   questions or comments to our web site. We will not obtain information
   that will allow us to identify you personally when you visit our site,
   unless you choose to provide us with such information.

   E-mail sent to NIDCD may be seen by a number of people responsible for
   answering questions. Occasionally, an information specialist who
   answers the mail may forward your question to an NIDCD scientist or
   employee who may help provide information for the response.

   We do not forward your mail to other organizations. You should be
   aware, though, that e-mail is not necessarily secure against
   interception. If your communication contains sensitive or personal
   information, you may want to send it by postal mail.

   Messages are answered by information specialists who process mail
   during normal business hours, Monday-Friday, except Federal holidays.
   Mail sent late Friday or over the weekend will not be reviewed until
   the following Monday. We try to respond to you within 48 hours.

   Q. Will this privacy policy change?

   A. Our privacy statement may be updated from time to time. When new
   privacy-related information is posted on this page, we will note the
   date that the policy was updated.

   Q. Whom can I contact for information about NIDCD's web privacy policy?

   A. If you have questions or comments about our privacy statement,
   contact the NIDCD Web Site Manager.
