   The FBI, originally 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation, serves as the
   investigative arm of the United States Department of Justice, with

   trafficking matters, and other violations of Federal statutes.

   Today's FBI consists of over 13,000 non-Agent personnel and 9,500
   Special Agents. In addition to its role in law enforcement, the FBI
   assists state and local polices agencies with its Forensic Laboratory,
   National Crime Information Center, and Identification Division and by
   training hundreds of state and local law enforcement officers at the
   FBI Academy each year. All of these activities require a large and
   diverse staff of non-Agent personnel.
