   P-24 Mission Statement:

   We research the basic and applied properties of plasmas with a view to
         applications in important Laboratory and National Programs.

   The Plasma Physics Group (P-24) researches the basic properties of
   plasmas with a view to applications in important Los Alamos National
   Laboratory and national programs. Plasmas occur in nature when matter
   exceeds temperatures of roughly 10,000¡C. At these temperatures, the
   constituent atoms and molecules of matter begin to lose their bound
   electrons to form a substance composed of positive or negative ions and
   free electrons. All principal phenomena in plasmas can be traced to the
   fact that ions and electrons interact with each other through
   long-range electromagnetic forces. The electromagnetic interactions of
   groups of charged particles are often coherent, leading to collective
   modes of plasma behavior. This collective interaction of charged
   particles, a many-body problem, is the essence of the field of plasma
   physics. Roughly 99% of the matter in the universe is in a plasma
   state. Plasmas can exist over a large range of temperatures and
   densities. For example, interstellar space contains plasmas with
   densities of less than one ion or electron per cubic meter at
   temperatures exceeding 1,000¡C. In contrast, plasmas created by intense
   laser compression of micropellets achieve densities up to 1026 ions or
   electrons per cubic centimeter at temperatures exceeding 10,000,000¡C.
   The understanding and application of such diverse plasmas is a Los
   Alamos core competency. P-24 is composed of a diverse technical staff
   with expertise in plasma physics, plasma chemistry, atomic physics,
   laser and optical science, pulsed power, dynamic properties of
   materials, and transient radiation and particle diagnostics. The group
   uses both on-site and off-site experimental facilities to address
   problems of national significance in inertial and magnetic fusion,
   high-energy-density physics, conventional defense, environmental
   management, and plasma-based advanced or green manufacturing. Our
   agenda includes basic research in the properties of energetic matter
   and applied research that supports the principal Laboratory mission of
   reducing the nuclear danger. The pursuit of this agenda entails the
   physics of plasmas over a wide and diverse range of conditions, as
   shown in Figure 1.
