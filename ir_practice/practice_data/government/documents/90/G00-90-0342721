   ALASKA:
   Denali National Park and Preserve, AK - An out-growth of the
   Wrangell-St. Elias National Park work, this joint study begins in FY99
   and will involve collection of stream-sediment, water, and rock samples
   from historic mining areas within the Park to determine modern-day
   effects and to provide baseline information. Sites to be studied
   address specific NPS land-management concerns. (Robert G. Eppinger, GD,
   MRP, Denver, CO; Ken Karle, NPS, Denali National Park, AK)

   Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, AK - Largest national
   park in the US; stream-sediment, water, and rock samples from 4
   historic mining districts and 2 un-mined, mineralized areas within the
   park were collected and analyzed for trace and major elements. Study
   quantifies modern-day effects of historic mining activity on stream
   sediment and surface waters and establishes pre-mining geochemical
   baselines in mineralized, but un-mined areas. (Robert G. Eppinger, GD,
   MRP, Denver, CO; Danny Rosenkrans, NPS, Wrangell-St. Elias NP, Copper
   Center, AK) http://www2.nature.nps.gov/grd/distland/amlindex.htm

   ARIZONA:
   Black Mesa, AZ - Peabody Western Coal is using groundwater to slurry
   pump coal via pipeline to a power plant in Laughlin, Nevada.
   Geohydrology and USGS modeling of the aquifer underlying Black Mesa
   indicate that groundwater withdrawal greatly exceeds recharge. An

   CALIFORNIA:
   Bear River and Yuba River Watersheds, CA - Uncontrolled mercury use
   during historic hydraulic mining of placer gold deposits, especially
   during 1849-1884, has resulted in extensive dispersal of mercury in
   these and other Sierra Nevada watersheds. Water, sediment, and biota
   (fish, amphibians, birds, and amphibians) are being sampled for mercury
   and methylmercury to assist other agencies in prioritizing abanonded
   mine sites for possible remediation. (Charlie Alpers and Mike

   and is highly ranked on USEPA's National Priority List for Superfund
   cleanup. USGS studies are contributing to improved understanding of
   geochemical, microbiological, and hydrologic processes controlling the
   generation, storage, and release of acid. (Charlie Alpers, WRD, CA

   Sacramento River, CA - Copper, zinc and cadmium concentrations are of
   concern in river reaches downstream from mined areas, especially in
   spawning habitat for treatened and endagered fish species.
   Ultrafiltration of water was used in 1996-97 to investigate dissolved
   and colloidal transport of metals in the river reach from Shasta Dam to
   Freeport (south of Sacramento). Ultraclean sampling and processing
   methods were applied to use trace elements and lead isotopes to
   understand transport processes and metal sources. (Charlie Alpers, WRD,
