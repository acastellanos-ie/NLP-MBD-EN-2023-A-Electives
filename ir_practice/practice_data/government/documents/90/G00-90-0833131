COAST & GEODETIC SURVEY COLLECTIONS

     * Volume I of the History of the Commissioned Corps of the National
       Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  This work has been
       supported by the Office of NOAA Corps Operations and is the result
       of five years of effort.  This first volume covers the years
       1807-1867 and details the work of the Coast Survey, its political
       battles,  its Civil War contributions, and its influence on the
       development and guidance of the American scientific community.  It
       is hoped that two additional volumes will be completed detailing
       the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey up to the formation of
       NOAA Corps.  Time table for completion of this effort is the year
       2007, the Bi-Centennial anniversary of the formation of the Coast
       Survey, America's first science agency.
     * The Coast and Geodetic Survey Album of Historical Photographs
       This album  presently contains over 3200 photographs, etchings,
       paintings, etc. of Coast and Geodetic Survey operations with
       earliest images dating from the 1830's.

     * The Coast and Geodetic Survey Annual Reports 1844 - 1910 -
       Bibliography of Appendices
       The appendices of the annual reports of the Superintendent of the
       Coast and Geodetic Survey contain a wealth of scientific and
       historic information.  This bibliography is organized so that a
       user can search chronologically, by author, or by scientific
       discipline.

     * Coast and Geodetic Survey Historical Map & Chart Collection
       A digitized collection of historical maps and charts provided by
       the Office of Coast Survey of the National Ocean Service.  Most of
       these maps and charts are pre-1900 and Civil War maps and charts
       are included.

   TALES FROM THE SURVEY

   The Coast and Geodetic Survey began serving the Nation in the early
   1800's.  Since that time, Coast Surveyors and their descendants have
   charted our coastline; conducted geodetic surveys throughout the United
   States, its territories, and many parts of the World; served in the
   major wars of the United States; surveyed the pioneer coasts of the
   Pacific beginning in 1849 and continuing through the Alaska surveys of
   today; surveyed the Philippine Islands following the Spanish-American
   War; and conducted oceanographic observations throughout the oceans of
   the Earth.  These are some stories recounting this work.

  Alaska Tales

     * Arctic Field Party Work
       Captain Robert Earle shares his impressions of surveying in the
       Arctic and on the Beaufort Sea

     * The Bering Sea Survey
       This is an account of the 1939 survey in the Bering Sea by the
       complement of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Ship PIONEER.  An
       interesting facet of this work was the use of horses in the
       Aleutian Islands.

     * Reminiscences of Alaska by Captain Thomas J. Maher, C&GS
       This account is a chapter in Captain Maher's autobiography, Around
       the World in Forty Years.  Captain Maher was of the old school of
       surveyors who called it as they saw it and he offered an
       unembellished view of the world that he observed.

  Ocean Tales

     * The Florida Reef - Excerpts from the first scientific study of the
       Florida Reef system by Louis Agassiz.  Agassiz conducted studies of
       the Florida Reef System at the request of the United States Coast
       Survey in 1851.  Much of what he wrote concerning this great
       natural feature could serve to help guide scientists today.
     * The Gulf Stream - the first three chapters of the classic account
       of Gulf Stream studies and exploration by John Elliott Pillsbury.
       These chapters describe the initial discovery of the Gulf Stream by
       Spanish explorers followed by accounts of the painfully won
       knowledge of this mighty river in the sea up until the year 1885.
     * Hurricane "Florence" versus Ship Hydrographer
       Ride out a hurricane with the Coast and Geodetic Survey Ship
       Hydrographer in the Gulf of Mexico in 1953.

     * The Origin of the Submarine Valleys along the Southern Edge of
       Georges Bank
       This article includes one of the earliest papers on submarine
       canyons by Dr. Francis P. Shepard, the "Father of Marine Geology."
       Dr. Shepard sailed often with Coast and Geodetic Survey ships and
       reviewed much of the C&GS hydrographic data for insight into the
       formation of submarine features.

  Personal Tales

     * Earth Measurer. The Autobiography of Carl Ingman Aslakson.
       [Aslakson, Carl I. [1980] Earth Measurer. Excerpt from unpublished
       manuscript.]
       Carl Ingman Aslakson served in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for
       thirty-two years, from 1923 until 1955. In 1979, at the age of 83,
       he wrote these memoirs for his family.
     * The Diary of William McCaslan Scaife Covering the Years 1919 and
       1920
       Join a young Coast Surveyor on sea duty and shore duty during his
       first two years of duty.  Things were rough working out of shore
       camps on the Alaska Peninsula in those days.
     * Notes on Discipline at Sea
       Captain Francis H. Hardy, Coast and Geodetic Survey, shares his
       views of maintaining discipline at sea  -- some sound advice for
       leaders at sea and ashore.
     * Profiles in Time: Biographies of those who served in the Coast &
       Geodetic Survey
       Over 200 biographies of individuals who served in various
       capacities in the Coast Survey and the Coast and Geodetic Survey.
       These biographies were found in various official and unofficial
       publications including the Annual Report of the Superintendent of
       the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Bulletin of the Coast and
       Geodetic Survey, The Buzzard, the NOAA Corps Bulletin, etc.  These
       articles were written to announce retirements and awards, or as
       obituaries.
     * Recollections of Whistler While in the Office of the United States
       Coast Survey by John Ross Key, Grandson of Francis Scott Key
     * Some Personal Recollections Of Over Twenty Years Ago
       Captain Harry Seran looks back twenty years to his first season in
       the Coast and Geodetic Survey.  Includes a description of working
       on the MATCHLESS, the last sailing vessel of the Coast and Geodetic
       Survey.

  Philippine Tales

     * The Geodetic Control of Northern Luzon
       The Coast and Geodetic Survey followed the flag to the Philippine
       Islands following the Spanish-American War.  After conducting
       coastal surveys for a quarter century, it became necessary to
       connect the geodetic work on the north end of the island of Luzon
       with the work to the south.  To do this required establishing a
       triangulation scheme through 200 miles of mountains and jungle

     * The Philippines by Captain Thomas J. Maher, C&GS
       This account is a chapter in Captain Maher's autobiography, Around
       the World in Forty Years.  Captain Maher was of the old school of
       surveyors who called it as they saw it and he offered an
       unembellished view of the world that he observed.

     * The Stranding and Salvaging of the Fathomer
       In 1936 the eye of a great typhoon passed directly over the Coast
       and Geodetic Survey Ship FATHOMER which had taken refuge at San
       Vicente Bay, northern Luzon.  This account describes the typhoon
       and the actions of the officers and crew of the FATHOMER in saving
       themselves and the ship.

     * Unfortunate Accident to Party on the Ship Fathomer
       Small boat work in support of surveying operations has always been
       hazardous.  Landing on rock-bound coasts or traveling miles through
       rough seas in small boats was a day to day event with the survey
       parties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.  This is the tragic
       account of one survey party whose luck ran out.

  Technology Tales

     * About Water Levels, Tides, and Currents - includes sections on the
       history and evolution of various technologies associated with tide
       and current observation and prediction

       Details the serendipitous discovery in 1930 of a small oil tanker
       only a week after its disappearance by a Coast and Geodetic Survey
       wire drag crew.

     * Reminiscences of Wire Drag Work
       Captain Nicholas Heck remembers early wire drag work.  Wire drag
       reigned supreme as the primary means of locating obstructions to
       navigation for over 70 years until the development of
       high-resolution sidescan sonar systems.

     * Search for Lost Plane, Great Salt Lake, Utah
       A unique wire drag assignment in a harsh environment.  Learn how
       the Coast and Geodetic Survey discovered an airplane that went down
       in Great Salt Lake in 1935.

     * The Start of the Acoustic Work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey
       Captain Nicholas Heck recounts the beginnings of acoustic depth
       sounding work and radio acoustic ranging navigation in the Coast
       and Geodetic Survey.  Radio acoustic ranging was the very first
       navigation system ever devised that did not depend on some visual
       means of determining one's position at sea.  As such, it was a
       major step on the road to electronic navigation systems.

  War Tales

     * Civil War Record of J.W. Donn
       John W. Donn was a Coast Survey Assistant who served as a
       topographer with the Union Army during the Peninsula Campaign, the
       Battle of Chattanooga, and other battles and campaigns.  Join Donn
       as he and fellow Coast Surveyor Frederic W. Dorr discover a second
       ford across White Oak Swamp allowing the evacuation of Union troops
       during the Seven Days, march to Malvern Hill ahead of the Union
       skirmish line, map the battlefield at Chattanooga while under fire,
       and conduct other mapping and reconnaissance for the Union forces.

     * A Letter from the Front
       A biographical sketch of RADM Charles A. Schanck designed around a
       letter that he wrote from Europe in February 1945 to the Director
       of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.  Schanck was then an Artillery
       surveyor and had worked through the Battle of the Bulge.

     * Pathfinder: Recollections of Those Who Served 1942-1971
       The Coast and Geodetic Survey Ship PATHFINDER served throughout the
       western Pacific and endured over 50 bombing raids and was crashed
       by a Kamikaze at Okinawa. It was said of the PATHFINDER that the
       road to Tokyo was paved with PATHFINDER charts.  These are the
       stories of some of those who served on the PATHFINDER during the
       war and in the years following.

     * World War II Medal Citations and Letters of Commendation of Coast
       and Geodetic Survey Officers -- A to M
       These citations and letters of commendation commemorate the work of
       the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the critical years of the
       Second World War.  During World War II Coast and Geodetic Survey
       Officers served in all branches of the Armed Services.  In
       particular, they provided invaluable service as Army and Marine
       artillery surveyors, as hydrographers and surveyors for the Navy
       and Army amphibious units, and as reconnaissance officers in the
       development of air routes and aeronautical charts for the Army Air
       Forces.  In these duties, they often worked in advance of the front
       lines.  For those that stayed at home, they helped produce millions
       of maps and charts for Allied forces and were a major factor in
       putting ordnance on target and moving men and materiel.

     * World War II Medal Citations and Letters of Commendation of Coast
       and Geodetic Survey Officers -- N to Z

  Western Tales

     * Autobiography of James S. Lawson
       Join Assistant James Lawson and George Davidson on the pioneer
       surveys of the West Coast.  Lawson's Autobiography covers the trip
       west with Davidson via the Isthmus of Panama at the height of gold
       fever, Indian encounters on the Northwest Coast, and adventure at
       sea.

     * Nine Days on the Summit of Mt. Shasta
       A classic work written by Assistant Benjamin A. Colonna of his 1878
       triangulation observations from the peak of 14,162- foot Mount
       Shasta.  One line observed was over 192 miles in length, the
       longest such line ever observed by conventional geodetic
       techniques.
