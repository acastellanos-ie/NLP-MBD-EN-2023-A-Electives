   Ames Laboratory is a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory that seeks
   solutions to energy-related problems through the exploration of
   chemical, engineering, environmental, materials, mathematical and
   physical sciences.  Ames Lab is operated for the DOE by Iowa State
   University and is a member of the Institute for Physical Research and
   Technology.

   The Institute for Physical Research and Technology (IPRT) at Iowa State
   University is a consortium of basic and applied research and
   information centers located in Ames, Iowa. The Department of Energy's
   Ames Laboratory, the foundation of the consortium, is the first and
   largest of the IPRT centers.  Encompassing essentially all fields of
   physical science and engineering, IPRT links its centers to the
   university community and to external constituencies through its
   outreach and educational programs.  IPRT is a partner in the Iowa
   Manufacturing Extension Partnership.
