   As a result of reorganizations, the DAT Home Page is Obsolete.  The
   Department of Advanced Technology (DAT) and the Department of Applied
   Science (DAS) were reorganized in year 2000 into 3 new Departments,
   EST, NNS, and ES.
     * Energy Sciences and Technology Department (EST)
     * Nonproliferation and National Security (NNS)
     * Environmental Sciences Department (ES)

                                Introduction

      The Department of Advanced Technology (DAT) is one of the largest
   scientific departments at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in terms
    of overall budget and size of staff. Work is performed primarily for
    the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
      (NRC), with additional support coming from several other Federal
     agencies, as well as some industrial sources. The multidisciplinary
      activities of the Department include theoretical and experimental
   studies on the safety of commercial nuclear power plants, evaluation of
     advanced nuclear power plants, development of improved methods for
      safeguarding nuclear material, nuclear waste management studies,
        compilation and evaluation of nuclear data required for users
     throughout the world, and providing assistance to the international
    community, especially Russia and the Ukraine, in the form of training
     and technology improvements in reactor safety and nuclear material
                                 safeguards.
