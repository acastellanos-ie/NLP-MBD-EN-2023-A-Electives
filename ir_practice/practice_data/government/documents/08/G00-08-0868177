   Welcome to the homepage for Girl Power!, the national public education
   campaign sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
   to help encourage and motivate 9- to 14- year-old girls to make the
   most of their lives. Girls at 8 or 9 typically have very strong
   attitudes about their health, so Girl Power! seeks to reinforce and
   sustain these positive values among girls ages 9-14 by targeting health
   messages to the unique needs, interests, and challenges of girls.
