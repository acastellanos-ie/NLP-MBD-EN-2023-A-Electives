   Following the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1789,
   Congress exercised its power under Article I to establish inferior
   federal courts. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created both district and
   circuit courts. Congress established one district court in each state
   and assigned each state to a circuit. This law organized three
   circuits. With the addition of new states, Congress created more
   district courts, and in 1802 it redivided the country into six
   circuits. A second reorganization took place in 1807 and an additional
   circuit was created. Thus began the history of the Seventh Circuit
   Court out of which the United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern
   District of Indiana was eventually created.
