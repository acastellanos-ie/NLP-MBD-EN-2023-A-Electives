   The mission of the U.S. Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center is
   to develop basic and applied information to strengthen agriculture in
   Hawaii and the Pacific Basin in an environmentally acceptable and
   sustainable manner by managing and developing tropical plant genetic
   resources, developing new technologies and germplasm for improving crop
   productivity by reducing physiological and disease constraints,
   developing and demonstrating appropriate strategies for managing crop
   pests, providing economically viable technologies for controlling
   quarantine pests, ensuring product quality and safety, and increasing
   economic returns.
