   Welcome to the Groundwater Level home page! This is a work in progress,
   so please check back often as we add more links. This page was created
   and is maintained by the Geology and Groundwater Section of the
   Department of Water Resources, Central District. Groundwater level
   measurements are made by the Central District Groundwater Data Unit,
   the Northern District Groundwater Section, the San Joaquin District
   Groundwater Data Unit, the Southern District Groundwater Section, and
   by cooperating federal and local agencies. This page provides access to
   data and hydrographs for nearly 20,000 wells in groundwater basins
   throughout California.

   Map Interface for Well Hydrographs and Data Reports

   Example location map Now, retrieve data through our map interface! The
   interface provides access to groundwater level data through a series of
   progressively larger-scale maps, allowing you to click on a well
   location to retrieve hydrographs and data. Hydrographs and data reports
   may also be obtained through our form interface.
