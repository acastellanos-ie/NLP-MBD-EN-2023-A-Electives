                           Angels Camp, California
                         "Home of the Jumping Frog"

   This beautiful little foothill town was founded in 1848 and two years
   later Placer gold was discovered. Located in Calaveras County, and the
   home of Mark Twain's famous Jumping Frog Jubilee, Angels Camp is
   nestled peacefully in the Sierra Foothills between Yosemite and Lake
   Tahoe, just three hours from the bay area.

   Angels Camp's greatest prosperity came with the deep gold mines between
   1880 and 1920. Take a walking tour of Main Street and pause for a
   moment to imagine. Angels is a quiet mountain town now, but at one time
   the city vibrated to the roar of the stamp mills and danced to the
   music of many saloons and dance halls. Many of the original buildings
   still line Main Street, buildings from the mid 1800s bearing thick
   stone walls and iron shutters.

   The past comes alive on the third Saturday of every month, with gun
   fights and historical re-enactments by Sierra Nevada Guns for Hire.
