      Welcome to NASA's Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP)
       website. We have developed this website to communicate Program
      information to IFMP staff, NASA employees and the general public.

    The mission of IFMP is to improve the financial, physical, and human
    resources management processes throughout the Agency. IFMP, under the
       auspices of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), is
   reengineering NASA's business infrastructure and implementing enabling
      technology to provide better management information for decision
                                   making.

    We will regularly post meeting minutes, presentations, articles about
     significant events, and newsletters on this website so that you can
    remain abreast of changes. We welcome your feedback. If you have any
   comments regarding the website, please direct them to Ronald Bowman at
                            rbowman@hq.nasa.gov.
