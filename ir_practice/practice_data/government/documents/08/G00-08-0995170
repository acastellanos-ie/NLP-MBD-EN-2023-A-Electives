                      Congressionally Authorized Coins
          ________________________________________________________

     In 1999, Congress authorized the United States Mint to issue a
     five-dollar gold coin, a silver dollar, and a clad half-dollar coin
     to commemorate the first meeting of Congress in the United States
     Capitol and to help build a Visitor Center for the Capitol. Congress
     moved to the newly-established city of Washington, D.C., late in the
     year 1800. Congress met for the first time in the Capitol - just a
     small section of the building today - on November 17. Today, 200
     years later, the Capitol building is the greatest visible symbol of
     representative democracy in the world.

     In different ways, the three coins are emblems of the first meeting
     of Congress in the Capitol and the history of democracy that the
     Capitol represents.

     The obverse of the gold coin, designed by the Mint's Chief
   Sculptor/Engraver, Elizabeth Jones, displays a carving of a Corinthian
   column of the type that is part of the Capitol's architecture. The
   reverse bears an image of the Capitol as it appeared in 1800. (Today,
   the original Capitol is the part of the building immediately north of
   the Rotunda.)

     The silver dollar is based on designs by artist Marika Somogyi and
   sculptor and engraver John Mercanti. The obverse portrays the original
   Capitol superimposed on the image of today's building, while the
   reverse has a bald eagle cloaked in a "U.S. Capitol Visitor Center"
   banner.

     The half-dollar, incorporating designs by artists Dean McMullen, Alex
   Shagin and Marcel Jovine, features the original Capitol within an
   outline of the present-day building on the obverse. The reverse has a
   circle of 16 stars, representing the 16 states that existed in 1800,
   and a recognition of the 32 Senators and 106 Members of the House of
   Representatives who made up the 6th Congress at that time.

     The building has expanded and the Nation has seen tremendous growth
     since 1800, and today the Capitol receives approximately 5,000,000
     visitors annually. As the workplace of the elected representatives
     of the people, the Capitol is - and should be - an open building.
     What is lacking is a suitable place to welcome our citizens who
     visit and provide them with information about how Congress carries
     out its constitutional responsibilities. Visitors often face long
     lines, congested corridors, inadequate facilities, crowded tours,
     limited exhibits, and a shortage of rooms for members to meet with
     visiting groups of constituents.

     Congress recently authorized the design, engineering and
     construction of a Capitol Visitor Center as a public/private venture
     to enhance the educational experience of visitors to the Capitol, as
     well as to help provide continued high security for the Capitol. The
     commemorative coins provide a meaningful way for all Americans to
     participate in this endeavor.
