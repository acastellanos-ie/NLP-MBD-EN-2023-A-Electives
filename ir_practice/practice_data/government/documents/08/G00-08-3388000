   Welcome to California's 1996 General Election Web Site!

   We are proud to provide you with up-to-the-minute election night
   returns over the Internet. This year, we have also posted the
   California Ballot Pamphlet and other election-related information on
   the web to help voters make better informed decisions.

   We are currently working with the Legislature to get campaign finance
   reports posted on our official Secretary of State Homepage. We hope to
   have this important information available during the 1998 elections.

   Please enjoy this unprecedented access to information regarding the
   California election and...

              Remember to vote on Tuesday, November 5th, 1996!
