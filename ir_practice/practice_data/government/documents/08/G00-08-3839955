   The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District provides services through 41
   Truck 61 stations and 650 uniformed and support personnel to nearly
   600,000 people in a 417 square mile area. Sac Metro represents 16
   predecessor fire agencies. Some of these fire agencies were founded in
   the early twenties to provide fire protection in remote parts of the
   County.

   The varied demographics of the District provide opportunity for its
   Engine 54 personnel to respond to emergencies in rural, suburban and
   urban settings. The wide diversity of emergency incidents require
   firefighters to be proficient in wildland fire fighting, structural
   fire fighting, crash fire rescue, technical rescue, swift water rescue,
   hazardous material mitigation, and paramedic medical services.

   The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District "METRO FIRE" continues to
   provide the best quality fire protection, fire prevention, fire safety
   education, emergency medical aid, and other emergency response
   services.
