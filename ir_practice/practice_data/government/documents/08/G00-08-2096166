   Welcome to the Go 4 IT! website. We have changed our URL to
   www.go4it.gov. Please confirm that you have accessed the revised
   version.
   The Office of Technology Policy developed this site as a public
   resource in response to information needs expressed since the release
   of our first report on this topic published in 1997. As one step, this
   site provides information on hundreds of IT education, employment, and
   training programs, and offers users the opportunity to submit their own
   programs for listing. If you want to access valuable information
   resources, to see what other government agencies are doing, or to find
   opportunities for collaboration on the wave of the future, Go 4 IT!
