   "Welcome to the home page for the California State Treasurer. This site
    contains current information on our State's investment portfolio, the
   Local Agency Investment Fund, and our bond programs, along with credit
                              rating histories.

      As State Treasurer, my goals are to protect taxpayer funds, cost
    effectively finance schools and other infrastructure which California
     needs to succeed in the 21st Century, and invest more in California
                                communities.

    As you browse through this site, I hope you find the contents useful
     and informative. I encourage you to visit the pages of the various
