   The U.S. Geological Survey provides the Nation with reliable, impartial
   information to describe and understand the Earth. In California, these
   issues include natural hazards, such as earthquakes and floods, and the
   effects on water resources of population growth and industrial and
   agricultural development.

   The USGS Water Resources has the principal responsibility within the
   Federal Government to provide the hydrologic information and
   understanding needed by others to achieve the best use and management
   of the Nation's water resources.

   Sacramento River Ground Water in the Sacramento Valley, California:
   NAWQA Report
   Chemicals used at land surface are reaching the ground water in the
   southeastern Sacramento Valley, according to report by the U.S.
   Geological Survey (USGS). The study showed that although the
   ground-water quality was suitable for most uses, 13 percent of wells
   sampled in the region exceeded primary State or Federal maximum
   contaminant or long-term health advisory levels.

   Chinese Mitten Crab Surveys of San Joaquin River Basin and Suisun Marsh
   This report describes data from monthly surveys using baited traps to
   attempt to capture Chinese mitten Crabs in the San Joaquin River basin
   and Suisun Marsh, California. No mitten crabs were caught in 92
   locations in the San Joaquin River basin where 352 traps were deployed,
   and only one mitten crab was caught out of 150 traps set in 34
   locations in Suisun Marsh. The baited traps were successful at
   capturing a variety of organisms, including catfishes, yellowfin
   gobies, and crayfish.

   AuthorityÂ¹s Perdue Water Treatment Plant Improving Water Quality In
   Sweetwater Reservoir, San Diego County
   Sweetwater Reservoir in San Diego County contains natural organic
   carbon that has a high potential to form hazardous disinfection
   byproducts during the drinking water-treatment process. Investigations
   from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Sweetwater Authority, the
   managers of Sweetwater Reservoir, suggest that relatively simple
   changes in reservoir- management and water-treatment strategies may
   reduce natural organic carbon concentrations, thereby reducing by 30
   percent the formation of a major type of disinfection byproduct,
   trihalomethanes (THMs).

   Conceptualized geologic section of the aquifer system Water Supply in
   the Mojave River Ground-Water Basin, and the Benefits of Artifical
   Recharge
   The Mojave River is an unpredictable source of water; residents of the
   basin rely almost entirely on ground water for their water supply. This
   reliance on ground water has resulted in overdraft conditions that have
   caused water-level declines, changes in the quantity and spatial
   distribution of recharge from the Mojave River, and loss of riparian
   habitat.
