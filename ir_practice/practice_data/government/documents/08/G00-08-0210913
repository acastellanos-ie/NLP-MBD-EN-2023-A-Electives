   RESEARCH & APPLICATIONS

   [Icon: Coastal & Marine Research]

   Coastal & Marine Environments Remotely sensed data help scientists and
   researchers map the seafloor, and learn more about our nation's coastal
   and marine habitats.

   [Icon: Arid Lands Research]

   Arid & Semi-Arid Lands Remote sensing techniques can be used to better
   understand the role of these fragile environments on a regional and
   global scale.

   [Icon: Other Environments Research]

   Other Land Environments Digital image products for practical
   applications, such as resource evaluation and mapping, help generate
   information and data that can be used by various fields and disciplines
   for research, mapping, exploration, and education.
