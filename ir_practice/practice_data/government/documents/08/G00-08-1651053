   The Plant Gene Expression Center (PGEC) conducts fundamental research
   in plant molecular biology. The Principal Investigators are elucidating
   the components of the signal transduction pathways responsible for the
   perception of environmental and cellular cues. Research programs
   include heavy metal tolerance, disease resistance, light perception,
   ripening, vegetative growth, and reproduction. Essential genes are
   identified, isolated, and their function determined. Plant Gene
   Expression Center scientists are also participating in an international
   effort to sequence plant genomes.

   The Plant Gene Expression Center is a unique collaboration of the
   Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and
   the Plant & Microbial Biology Department of the University of
   California. PGEC research leaders are members of the PMB Department and
   research opportunities are available in our laboratories for graduate
   and undergraduate students.
