  NOAA Ship OREGON II Conducts 2002 SEAMAP Cooperative Winter Striped Bass
                               Tagging Cruise

   NOAA Ship Oregon II at sea NOAA Ship OREGON II, the first ship to begin
   the 2002 field season, departed January 8 to begin the winter year
   project in support of NOAA's National Ocean Service Lab in Beaufort,
   North Carolina, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

   The project involves multiple facets. Biological, chemical and
   hydrographic data were collected to examine early life history of fish
   in the vicinity of Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, Charleston
   Gyre and the Carolina Capes. The ship also conducted striped bass,
   Atlantic sturgeon and spiny dogfish tagging.

   Ship crew empty fish from the net During the cruise, the ship was
   visited by David DiBenedetto, who is writing a book on the fall
   migration of striped bass. James Rowe, Master of the OREGON II, Bill
   Cole, coordinator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and several
   other scientists and crew were interviewed while conducting tours and
   educating DiBenedetto about the operations and objectives of the
   Striped Bass research aboard the OREGON II. Mr DiBenedetto will not
   only focus on the people involved with striped bass, but on the natural
   history and tremendous comeback of the striped bass and the future
   management of the fish.

   other ships and aircraft.
