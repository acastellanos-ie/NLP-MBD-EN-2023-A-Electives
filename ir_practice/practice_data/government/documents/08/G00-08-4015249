   The ECS Data Handling System (EDHS) is the on-line document and data
   repository for the EOSDIS Core System (ECS) project. The ECS Project is
   a vital component of the
   U. S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and NASA's Earth Science
   Enterprise Program.

   The purpose of the EDHS is to provide electronic distribution of
   current versions and releases of products associated with the ECS
   Project. Products include, but are not limited to: documents, technical
   reports, working papers, user manuals, and presentations. The
   repository serves the ECS project staff, NASA facilities, and a wide
   science user community. There are also links to other web pages that
   provide information on the ECS Project. The EDHS web pages are
   maintained by the ECS Data Management organization located in the ECS
   Development Facility (EDF) in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Directional
   maps to the EDF can be obtained through this link.

   Users may perform a QuickSearch (metadata query) of softcopy documents
   to identify products of interest. In most cases, files are posted to
   the EDHS in the Portable Document Format (PDF). Visit the Adobe Acrobat
   website and download the most current version of the FREE Acrobat
   Reader. Version 4.0 or higher is recommended for viewing files posted
   to this site.

   Use the EOSDIS Acronym Finder to help decipher over 1800 acronyms. (The
   acronym finder was created by Dietmar Teitz.)
