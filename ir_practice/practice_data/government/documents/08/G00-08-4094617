          President Bush Signs Landmark Education Reforms into Law

   WASHINGTON, D.C.
   -- On January 8, 2002, President George W. Bush signed into law H.R. 1,
   the No Child Left Behind Act, the culmination of a yearlong, bipartisan
   effort to bring accountability and flexibility to federal education
   programs. H.R. 1 Bill Signing Ceremony The signing ceremony took place
   in Hamilton, Ohio, in the home district of Rep. John Boehner (R-OH),
   chairman of the House Education & the Workforce Committee. The four
   principal negotiators on the bill -- Rep. Boehner, Rep. George Miller
   (D-CA), Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH), and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) -- were
   present, in addition to Education Secretary Rod Paige, Ohio Governor
   Robert Taft, and lawmakers who served on the education conference
   committee.

   H.R. 1 reflects each of the four pillars of the Presidents education
   reform blueprint: accountability and testing, flexibility and local
   control, funding for what works, and expanded parental options. It is a
   comprehensive overhaul of the federal Elementary and Secondary
   Education Act (ESEA), which was enacted in 1965 and is the principal
   federal law affecting K-12 education today.

   I decided to sign this bill in one of the most important places in
   America -- a public school, said President Bush. Today begins a new
   era, a new time for public education in our country. Our schools will
   have higher expectations -- we believe every child can learn. From this
   day forward, all students will have a better chance to learn, to excel,
   and to live out their dreams.

   Today, we witnessed the signing of the most important piece of
   legislation most of us will ever work on. This education reform bill is
   meant to bring new purpose to a federal law that has lost its focus and
   never met its promise to our children, said Boehner. It will give new
   freedom, new flexibility, and new resources to local school officials
   at a time when they need these tools the most, a time when theyre being
   asked to meet higher expectations for our children, the future of our
   country.
