   [Applications

   A major goal of the NREN Project is to enable the fusion of emerging
   network technologies into NASA mission applications, resulting in new
   paradigms for conducting science across all NASA Enterprise Programs.
   Working closely with NASA Programs, NASA centers and other Federal
   agencies, the NREN Project selects applications that will have a
   substantial impact on NASA missions and that are constrained by
   currently available network capabilities. The NREN Project then works
   with NASA mission personnel to develop and demonstrate these
   applications, researching network technologies that are required to
   bring the applications to fruition. The NREN testbed, a leading edge,
   high-bandwidth network testbed connecting HPCC and other targeted NASA
   application communities, provides a platform for conducting prototyping
   activities and application demonstrations. The NREN Project
   collaboratively utilizes the high-performance testbeds sponsored by
   other Next Generation Internet or Internet2 participants to provide
   connectivity to an even broader range of NASA customers.

   Virtual Collaborative Clinic: The clinic demonstrates high-fidelity 3-D
   imaging and interactive virtual environment technologies across a
   high-performance wide area network. These technologies allow physicians
   to share complex 3-D models for remote consultation, diagnosis,
   treatment planning and surgical simulation. Virtual Collaborative

   Trans-Pacific Satellite Communications Demonstrations: TPD demonstrates
   that traditional Internet protocols can be engineered for use over
   double satellite hops, and that end-to-end connectivity can be provided
   at sufficiently high data rates to support interactive demonstrations
   in such a challenging environment. The project demonstrated interactive
   international access to the large "Visible Human" data set and
   investigated the performance impact of the double satellite hop.

   Digital Sky Virtual Observatory: The Digital Sky Virtual Observatory
   Project enables the accessing and interrelating of large,
   geographically distributed data sets and images from multiple sky
   surveys. The Digital Sky Virtual Observatory application developed at
   JPL allows one to view higher-resolution insets of particular regions
   of the sky overlaid on lower-resolution mosaics of the entire sky.

   Virtual Mechanosynthesis: The Virtual MechanoSynthesis (VMS)
   application couples an accurate molecular dynamics simulation code to
   an immersive graphical display with interactive capabilities and manual
   force feedback, allowing users to interact virtually with small
   collections of atoms. VMS employs computational steering that allows
   users to immediately see the results of interactively changed
   parameters and provides opportunities to detect and explore patterns of
   cause and effect. Virtual Mechanosynthesis Thumbnail
   Earth Observing System (EOS): Distributed Spreadsheet Interactive Image
   Spreadsheets facilitate advanced visualizations of very large databases
   such as those produced by next-generation satellite systems.

   Virtual Simulation Laboratory (VLAB): A virtual simulation laboratory
   offers remote analysis and interactive participation to create a new
   approach to aeronautical research and development. VLAB Thumbnail
   Mars Pathfinder: State-of-the-art graphic visualization tools create an
   interactive virtual environment model to assist the Sojourner rover
   operations during the Mars Pathfinder mission. Mars Pathfinder

   Nomad Rover: Robotic technologies relevant to long-duration,
   long-distance planetary excursion and performance of remote geological
   experiments are demonstrated. Nomad Rover Thumbnail
   Turbulent Convection and Dynamos in Stars: Collaborating researchers at
   different sites around the country employ 3-D virtual reality
   environments to analyze a visualization that has been multicast over
   high-performance networks. Turbulent Convection and Dynamos in Stars

   Ames Autogenic Feedback Training System: Ames researchers hope to
   extend training techniques used to develop voluntary control of
   autonomic responses to help individuals adapt to unusual, remote
   environments such as those encountered in space flight. Thumbnail
