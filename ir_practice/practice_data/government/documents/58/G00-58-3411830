   Current Status

   Triana has been put into a storage container and will reside in GSFC's
   large clean room until a viable flight opportunity has been identified.
   Thanks to all of the Triana team.

   Flight Status

   The constrained Shuttle flight rate of six per year, established in the
   2001 NASA budget planning process, requires that NASA give priority to
   the primary International Space Station (ISS) payloads, Hubble Space
   Telescope (HST) reboost, and Microgravity experiments. Consequently, it
   is not possible at this time to identify a definitive launch date for
   Triana.

   As a result, NASA is working to complete the integration and
   qualification testing of the Triana Mission flight hardware and to
   place those assets into storage to await the determination of a future
   launch opportunity. Efforts associated with preparing for both the
   launch and operation of the mission are rapidly being suspended. System
   hardware qualification is anticipated to be completed by the end of
   September, 2001.

   No Fiscal year 2002 (FY 02) funding has been set aside for the project.
   Launch opportunities are being investigated within the Space
   Transportation System (STS) planning manifest process and additionally
   as a possible Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) payload. Restart plans
   will be dependent upon the definition of the mission launch date and
   approach.

   What is Triana?

   Triana is a mission dedicated to helping scientists construct more
   accurate models of Earth's climate and answering a key Earth Science
   question-- how solar radiation affects climate.

   Christopher Columbus' Ship A proposal from the Scripps Institution of
   Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, was selected
   by NASA to lead the implementation of the Triana mission. Francisco P.
   J. Valero, director of the Atmospheric Research Laboratory will lead
   the development of the mission.

   Triana is designed to study the Earth, for the first time, from a
   vantage point of a million miles away and promises to offer new
   insights into how our planet's climate works as an integrated system.

   Space Shuttle Named after Rodrigo de Triana, the lookout who first saw
   the New World from Columbus' ship, Triana will start its 1 million-mile
   journey to L1 (the LaGrange neutral gravity point between the Earth and
   the Sun) aboard a Space Shuttle early in 2001. It will then be boosted
   by a solid rocket upper stage for an expected arrival at the vicinity
   of the L1 point in approximately three months.

   Once it reaches its destination, Triana's camera, Scripps Earth
   Polychromatic Imaging Camera (Scripps-EPIC) will begin to transmit a
   full color (Red, Green, and BlueÂ—RGB) image of the entire sunlit side
   of the Earth once every fifteen minutes. Image of Earth These images
   will then be continuously distributed over the Internet. Except for a
   few planetary fly-bys (e.g., Galileo), NASA has not had a spacecraft to
   provide the public with a full disk image of the Earth since Apollo.

   Data from Scripps-EPIC and Scripps-NISTAR will enable scientists to
   monitor the Earth's radiant power and to analyze weather systems and
   cloud patterns in an entirely new way. Find out more about Solar Winds
   In the past, scientists have had to stitch together thousands of
   measurements from satellites in low Earth or geostationary orbits to
   get a perspective comparable to Triana's. In conjunction with
   observations from other satellites, Triana will provide a new set of
   powerful tools to increase our understanding of Earth.

   One of Triana's primary goals is to provide high quality educational
   products that will aid in teaching students about planet Earth.

   Science Objectives

   Make the first direct measurements of the radiant power emitted by the
   whole Sun-lit side of the Earth to increase our understanding of how
   much of the Suns energy is absorbed in the atmosphere and improve our
   understanding of global climate

   Observe the vegetation canopy structure and evolution to monitor the
   health of the Earths vegetation.

   Measure ozone and cloud coverage to study their affect on the amount of
   UV radiation that reaches the ground.

   Measure global aerosol optical thickness to increase our knowledge of
   how pollution, generated by both human and natural causes, affects the
   Earth.

   Improve our understanding of the characteristics of the solar wind and
   magnetic field and provide an early warning system for communication
   satellites and ground based systems susceptible to solar-related
   disturbances

   Baseline Triana Spacecraft

   Triana Spacecraft link

     Triana's spacecraft is based on the innovative SMEX-Lite technology.

   It utilizes an advanced low cost, high performance end-to-end
   spacecraft architecture.
