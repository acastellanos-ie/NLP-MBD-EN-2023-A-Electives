   Predictions

Sorry but this is very much a work in progress

   At the moment this is a suite of programs written in C, PERL, HTML,
   FORTRAN, JAVASCRIPT and UNIX shell script. They are continually being
   developed and tested to be made more accurate.
   It is also hoped that they will soon be ported to all perl scripts
   running on a LINUX box and this will improve the speed with which
   predictions are made.

   To make a prediction all you need to do is to click on the run program
   link on the left hand side of the browser. This takes you to the
   submission page. All you have to do then is enter your e-mail, a title
   (if you want) and your DNA sequence which you suspect may be an RNA
   gene.

   The sequence must only contain the bases a, c, g, t or u (case
   insensitive). Any other characters, except spaces and carriage returns,
   will cause the program to generate an error and tell you which is the
   first character it doesn't like.

   The sequence must be longer than 40 nt and shorter than ~ 7,000 nt or
   else the machine will generate an error and produce gibberish. N.B./
   When the program checks the input sequence length it counts whitespace
   as a character so may still return an error because of that.
   Then select the organism which most closely resembles your genomic DNA
   and click on submit. The results are computed and should be e-mailed to
   you in a few minutes.

   The program breaks the sequence into windows of 80 nt (with an overlap
   of 40) and computed the probability of each window being an RNA gene.
   It will tell you whether or not this window is either not predicted,
   predicted or strongly predicted to be part of an RNA gene.

   If you see a cluster of predictions around the same area this may be
   indicative of a larger rna gene.
   Any comments or for further help contact me.
