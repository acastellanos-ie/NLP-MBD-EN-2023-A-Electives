   The Urban Environment  [ Urban Climatology Home ]

   Whereas an acre of forest or cropland receives as much sunlight as an
   acre of buildings, it is well known that the green space will be cooler
   because of transpiration (water evaporation) and shading of the ground.
   Typical urban surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt, get much hotter
   than vegetated surfaces during the day. They store the energy and
   release it at night, thus creating a dome of warmer air over the city.
   Thus, the "urban heat island" causes increased air conditioning usage,
   as well as being directly related to increased ozone formation, a major
   pollutant in our cities.

   [atlanta_use.gif] Rapid population growth in the last 25 years (27%
   between 1970-80, and from 33% in 1980-90) has made Atlanta one of the
   fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States. This rapid
   growth has translated into an approximately 17% decline in forest land
   in the Atlanta metropolitan region between 1973 and 1992. Atlanta is
   also a model for what is in store for other cities, especially in
   developing nations where the industrial revolution is taking off and
   threatens large areas of forest or jungle. This enormous transition of
   land from forest and agriculture to an urban landscape results in
   subsequent changes in the land-atmosphere energy balance relationships.

   [atlas_atlanta.gif] To understand the relationship of land use patterns
   to heat production and its effect on the lowest layers in the
   atmosphere, the GHCC conducted the Atlanta Urban Heat Island Experiment
   in May 1997. As the NASA Learjet carried the Advanced Thermal and Land
   Applications Sensor (ATLAS) 5 km above the city on May 11-12, 1997, the
   GHCC asked Atlanta-area school children to measure temperatures around
   their schools to provide "ground truth" data (as well as a science
   lesson for the students). Using the ATLAS data as a baseline for land
   cover/land use, GHCC scientists and their partners are performing
   "prospective" modeling on how meteorological conditions and air quality
   will change, predicated on the Atlanta Regional Commission's (ARC)
   20-year plan. They hope to provide the ARC and other planning or
   decision-making bodies with model output that can be used to modify or
   revise growth plans for the Atlanta metropolitan area, and to help
   mitigate or ameliorate the expansion of the urban heat island effect or
   possible further deterioration in air quality.

   [ozone.gif] Other research performed by GHCC scientists has been in
   association with the Southern Oxidant Study (SOS), a consortium of
   universities and government laboratories. In 1995, a large-scale
   observation program in the Nashville area included several major
   research aircraft, and was probably the biggest concerted air pollution
   field campaign ever conducted in the U.S. Ozone data collected by
   aircraft dramatically illustrated the effect of urbanization upon local
   air chemistry. Analysis of data from this project, including its use in
   the validation and development of more sophisticated models, continued
   in 1997.

   Building on the Atlanta and SOS research, an EPA-funded GHCC project
   has been launched to examine urban land use and its effect on thermal
   characteristics and processes that drive the development of the urban
   heat island phenomenon for nine cities across the United States.
   Important information will be gained that can be used to augment the
   Cool Communities program by having a better understanding of how the
   size, geographic location, and land cover/land use composition of
   different U.S. cities affects heating patterns. Data collected using
   aircraft and/or satellite sensors will be used as input to a
   sophisticated EPA model used by the Lawrence Berkeley National
   Laboratory to determine the effects of land use urban heating on the
   generation of ozone. By combining the aircraft data with satellite data
   in some of the cities, knowledge will be gained that will allow the
   application of satellite data alone for other cities.
