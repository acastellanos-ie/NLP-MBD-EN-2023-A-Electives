         Fulfilling America's Promise to Americans with Disabilities
                           New Freedom Initiative
     __________________________________________________________________

    The New Freedom Initiative announced by President Bush on February 1,
     2001 is part of a nationwide effort to remove barriers to community
   living for people with disabilities. It represents an important step in
   working to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to learn and
   develop skills, engage in productive work, and choose where to live and
    participate in community life. Its goal for people with disabilities
      include: increasing access to assistive and universally designed
        technologies; expanding educational opportunities; promoting
       homeownership; integrating Americans with disabilities into the
   workforce; expanding transportation options; and promoting full access
                             to community life.

                     The initiatives' proposals include:
     * Promoting full access to community life through swift
       implementation of the Olmstead Supreme Court decision;
     * Integrating Americans with disabilities into the workforce through
       swift implementation of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives
       Improvement Act of 1999 (TWWIIA); and
     * The creation of the National Commission on Mental Health.

    The President took his first step in calling for swift implementation
   of the Olmstead decision by issuing an Executive Order on June 18, 2001
      directing federal agencies to identify barriers and solutions for
   community living. Implementation of this Order calls for public in-put.

   HHS presented President Bush with Delivering on the Promise: Peliminary
    Report of Federal Agencies' Actions to Eliminate Barriers and Promote
    Community Integration on December 21, 2001. Individual reports of the
     agencies carrying out the Executive Order will be presented to the
                        President in the near future.
