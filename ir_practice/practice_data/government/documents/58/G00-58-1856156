     The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducts an interlaboratory
     evaluation program semiannually. This program provides a variety of
     Standard Reference Samples for laboratory quality assurance testing
     and are available to purchase for internal quality control. The
     majority of samples are prepared with natural-matrix water from
     Colorado streams.

   The program began in 1962 with a single sample containing major
   constituents that was prepared from distilled water and reagent grade
   chemicals. Twenty-three USGS laboratories participated in the 1962
   determinations of six analytes in the major standard reference sample
   (SRS). Since that time, objectives of the program have been to
   accomplish the following:
     * Evaluate and improve the performance of USGS and other
       participating laboratories;
     * Provide a library of carefully prepared, homogeneous, stable
       reference materials for use in the quality control programs of
       laboratories;
     * Identify analytical problem areas;
     * Identify quality assurance needs with respect to environmental
       analyses and develop new reference materials to meet these needs;
       and
     * Ascertain the accuracy and precision of analytical methods

   Over two hundred USGS and non-USGS laboratories are registered in the
   program, which can currently provide six standard reference sample
   types.

   Though this is not a laboratory certification program, participation in
   this continuing quality assurance program is mandatory for all
   laboratories providing water-analyses data for USGS data storage or use
   (publications). Federal, State, municipal, and university laboratories
   can participate even though they do not provide data to the USGS (we
   are not enrolling new labs at this time). Analyses of these SRS
   provides the means to alert participating laboratories of possible
   deficiencies in their analytical operations, and also provides
   reference materials for in-house quality control programs.
   Participating laboratories can purchase previously made SRS by calling
