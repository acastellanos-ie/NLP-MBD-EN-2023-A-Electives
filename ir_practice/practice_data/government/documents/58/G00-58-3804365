   The unique qualities of a marine protected area combined with intense
   recreational and commercial use of the nationally significant marine
   resources surrounding the Florida Keys demands a multitude of creative
   education strategies. One of the primary mandates of the Florida Keys
   National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act (FKNMSPA) is to educate
   the public about the marine environment surrounding the Keys. The
   diverse habitats, resources, and unique setting of the Keys offer
   opportunities for the interpretation of marine subtropical and
   temperate environments. Education and outreach strategies in the action
   plan fall into two general categories: community involvement/community
   program strategies and product development strategies.

   The first group includes education and outreach strategies designed as
   interactive programs for user groups (e.g., exhibit production,
   training programs, workshops, school programs, public-involvement
   forums, and special events). Strategies that result in the development
   of specific products (i.e., printed materials, audio-visual materials,
   signs and displays in high-use areas of the Keys, public service
   announcements, visitor booths/displays etc.) providing a mechanism for
   public education and outreach are included in the second group. The
   education and outreach strategies were developed based on input from
   environmental educators, Sanctuary education staff, user groups,
   environmental activists, concerned citizens, and though public comment
   received on the draft management plan.

   The unique qualities of a marine protected area combined with intense
   recreational and commercial use of the nationally significant marine
   resources surrounding the Florida Keys demands a multitude of creative
   education strategies. The links from this page give an overview of the
   Sanctuary's education program and a description of each of the vehicles
   presently used to provide interpretation and education to the public.

   For more detailed information about the education and outreach program
   goals and strategies please refer to the Education Product List, the
   Programs and Activities Sheet, or the Florida Keys National Marine
   Sanctuary Final Management Plan, Volume 1, pages 57 - 84. The
   Management plan is available at any of the Sanctuary offices or via
   request for shipment.
