   Business Retention & Expansion

      Sixty to eighty percent of all new jobs are created by existing
      businesses. Local companies are valuable resources that communities
      cannot afford to ignore or lose. The jobs they generate further
      employment gains and create new businesses and tax revenues to boost
      local economies.

   Services

      The Business Retention and Expansion program works with manufacturing
      and processing firms on retention and local expansion issues. (For
      out-of-area expansion, see OTED Business Development.) OTED staff, in
      conjunction with local Economic Development Council (EDC) staff,
      identify threatened or expanding manufacturing companies and provide
      problem-solving and technical assistance to these firms. The program
      also focuses on early warning, coordination of services and resources,
      assessment of industry issues and capacity building for EDC staff, and
      assist rural counties with local business visitation programs.

   Accomplishments

      The Business Retention and Expansion Program has helped retain and
      expand 262 manufacturing/processing firms resulting in the creation or
      retention of over 20,282 jobs and $62 million in state tax revenue in
      its ten years. For every state dollar spent, the program generated an
      estimated $19 in state taxes.
