                           Promoting International
                             Trade & Development

    The Cruz M. Bustamante Cup, sponsored by the Los Angeles GaLAxy, is a
    creative and innovative attempt to build international relationships
     around the world for the purpose of trade, economic development and
                 cultural exchange on behalf of California.

                            Lt. Gov and Cardenas

   On August 4, 1999, another trade barrier was brought down when the
   Honorable Alberto Cardenas, Governor of Jalisco, Mexico arrived in Los
   Angeles, California at the invitation of Lieutenant Governor Cruz M.
   Bustamante. The two officials began the day by discussing vital issues
   relative to business development between their two important states.

   Following a breakfast meeting and outlining the dayÂ’s events together,
   they began a series of meetings with business leaders. Included was the
   kickoff of the California-Mexico Scholars Program which will provide an
   exchange of the best and brightest California students with the best
   and brightest Mexican students.

   The focus of the day, however, was a roundtable luncheon. Lieutenant
   Governor Bustamante and Governor Cardenas met with approximately 35
   business leaders from various industries for an open discussion.

   This also gave the industry leaders a chance to ask questions and share
   concerns directly with the two leaders.

   After the City of Pasadena presented the key to their city to Governor
   Cardenas the day was capped off by attending the inaugural Cruz M.
   Bustamante Cup.

   This sporting event, whose proceeds went to charity, the Los Angeles
   Galaxy invited the Chivas Rayadas from Guadalajara to compete in an
   international soccer match. This would be a battle that would give
   bragging rights to the winner both for the teams and for the two
   leaders, Lt. Governor Bustamante and Governor Cardenas.

   As added entertainment, comedian Paul Rodriguez and actor Edward James
   Olmos attended, making it an unforgettable evening.

   While the Los Angeles Galaxy was victorious on the field, both
   California and Jalisco were the real winners.
