   2001 & 2002 Performance Plan
   Introduction

   The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) was established on November 2,
   1953, pursuant to authority vested in the Secretary of Agriculture by 5
   U.S.C. 301 and Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953, and other
   authorities.

   ARS is the principal in-house research agency of the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture (USDA). Congress first authorized federally supported
   agricultural research in the Organic Act of 1862, which established
   what is now USDA. That statute directed the Commissioner of Agriculture
   "... To acquire and preserve in his Department all information he can
   obtain by means of books and correspondence, and by practical and
   scientific experiments..." The scope of USDA's agricultural research
   programs has been expanded and extended more than 60 times since the
   Department was created.

   ARS research is authorized by the Department of Agriculture Organic Act
   of 1862 (7 U.S.C. 2201 note), Agricultural Research Act of 1935 (7
   U.S.C. 427), Research and Marketing Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-733), as
   amended (7 U.S.C. 427, 1621 note), Food and Agriculture Act of 1977
   (P.L. 95-113), as amended (7 U.S.C. 1281 note), Food Security Act of
   1985 (P.L. 99-198) (7 U.S.C. 3101 note), Food, Agriculture,
   Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-624) (7 U.S.C. 1421
   note), Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (P.L.
   104-127), and Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform
   Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-185). ARS derived most of its objectives from
   statutory language, specifically the "Purposes of Agricultural
   Research, Extension, and Education" set forth in Section 801 of FAIR.

   The ARS mission is to conduct research to develop and transfer
   solutions to agricultural problems of high national priority and
   provide information access and dissemination to: ensure high-quality,
   safe food, and other agricultural products; assess the nutritional
   needs of Americans; sustain a competitive agricultural economy; enhance
   the natural resource base and the environment; and provide economic
   opportunities for rural citizens, communities, and society as a whole.

   The Agencys research focuses on achieving six broad goals identified in
   the Strategic Plan of the Research, Education, and Economics (REE)
   mission area of which ARS is a part. The Government Performance and
   Results Act (GPRA) mandates each agency to establish general goals that
   will contribute to achieving beneficial societal outcomes that shape
   and drive the work of the Agency during the five years covered by the
   plan.

   Verification, Validation and Program Evaluation:
   ARS currently conducts a series of review processes designed to ensure
   the relevance and quality of its research work and to maintain the
   highest possible standards for its scientists. This process involves
   customer input to help keep the research focused on the technical needs
   of the American food and agricultural system. Each of the approximately
   1,100 research projects, which are organized into 22 National Programs,
   undergoes a thorough merit review before new or renewed activities are
   begun. All ARS employees, including the scientific workforce, are
   subject to annual performance reviews, and the senior scientists
   undergo a rigorous peer review (Research Position Evaluation
   SystemRPES) on a 3- to 5-year cycle. These processes ensure the
   continuing high quality of the ARS scientific workforce.

   The new National Programs focus the work of the Agency on achieving the
   goals defined in the ARS Strategic Plan. The research priorities for
   each National Program are established with extensive input from
   customers, stakeholders, and partners received, in part, at a series of
   National Program Workshops. A detailed Action Plan is developed for
   each National Program and it is available on the ARS home page
   www.ars.usda.gov.

   In FY 2000, ARS began a series of National Program and program
   component reviews that help to ensure the quality, relevancy,
   effectiveness, and productivity of the work being done in each National
   Program. Additional information on the new ARS quality review program
   is available on the ARS home page under "Scientific Quality Review."
   The Annual Performance Plans will also serve to keep the work of the
   Agency focused on achieving the goals established in the ARS Strategic
   Plan. The aggregate effect of these changes will be a strengthened
   research program and an accountability system that will measure more
   effectively the progress made towards achieving established goals and
   outcomes.

   Key External Factors that Affect the Ability of ARS to Achieve its
   Goals and Objectives:
   The future of American agriculture depends on its ability to respond to
   critical external factors. Effective planning within REE will take
   these factors into consideration when establishing and executing the
   mission area research, analysis, and education agenda.

   Globalization:
   The globalization of all aspects of the food and fiber system is having
   a major impact on American agriculture. From competitive markets around
   the world, to diseases not limited to national boundaries, to
   population growth and evolving diets, profound changes are seen
   worldwide. These changes have led to a dramatically new trade
   environment, threats of exotic diseases and pests to domestic
   production, and international controversies over the use of
   biotechnology. To remain competitive, the food and agriculture sector
   needs to take these developments into consideration.

   Information Access and Communication:
   The explosion of information technology in the 1990s, the worldwide use
   of the Internet, and the major advancements of cyberspace
   communications are changing the way private industry, government, and
   individuals conduct daily business. Vast amounts of information soon
   will be available in "real time," more people from around the world
   will be able to retrieve the information, and advanced computer
   software will make this information more useful and meaningful. The
   advancements in communications technology offer opportunities for
   everyone involved in the American food and agriculture sector.

   Workforce:
   Employment issues are very important to obtain and retain a highly
   skilled and technically well trained Federal workforce. The low U.S.
   unemployment rate of the 1990s is expected to continue into the 21st
   century, making recruitment highly competitive. This competitive
   environment is expected to require more employer emphasis on
   recruitment, retention, student employment, upward mobility, and
   training/retraining programs. The public sector will need to recruit a
   diversity of people and to maintain a highly qualified and technically
   competent workforce. Expanding job opportunities for women and
   minorities in science, engineering, economics, and statistics will help
   tap the Nations human potential.

   Technology:
   Advances in technology--such as bioengineering, precision agriculture,
   remote sensing, and decision modeling--can transform agricultural
   production to enhance nutrition, protect the environment, and continue
   to make our food supply safe. Biotechnology offers great promise for
   increases in production efficiency, improved food quality, and enhanced
   nutritional value. However, concerns about genetically modified
   organisms (GMOs) have had a marked impact on international exports of
   affected commodities and prompted questions about the potential
   benefits and risks. Precision agriculture, remote sensing, and decision
   modeling will both increase production efficiency and mitigate the
   adverse environmental impacts of agriculture. Public concern about food
   safety has led to new rapid detection technologies that, when fully
   implemented, will make the food supply increasingly safe.

   Public Policy Framework and Policy Context:
   Starting in the 1930s, public policy on agriculture was aimed at
   addressing farm income levels that were significantly below the average
   income in the rest of the U.S. A slow and uneven evolution away from
   Federal intervention in markets culminated in 1996, when Congress
   enacted the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act,
   which phased out Federal price support programs. Since then,
   variability in prices has prompted legislation to provide emergency
   assistance to farmers, which again has raised issues relating to risk
   management and the well-being of producers. In the 21^st century, farm
   policy is no longer the only area of public policy important to U.S.
   agriculture. Increasingly, issues relating to environmental quality,
   food safety, consumers, food security, nutrition, and trade have
   emerged as major forces influencing agriculture.

   Changing Demographics:
   Growing global populations, demographic changes, and economic growth
   will substantially increase the demand for agricultural products thus
   creating new markets for American products. At the same time, increased
   agricultural efficiency in other countries will force U.S. agriculture
   to become more competitive. Because arable agricultural land is
   limited, the growing demands will increase pressure to maximize yields,
   protect marginal areas from unsustainable development, and minimize the
   harmful effects of agriculture on the environment and the natural
   resource base.

   Changing Structure of Agriculture:
   The structure of the food and fiber system--from farm to
   market--changed dramatically in the last decades of the 20^th century,
   which is likely to continue. An increasing share of U.S. food and fiber
   is being produced on fewer, larger, and more specialized farms. Similar
   change can be seen across the food and agriculture sector. Firms are
   larger, and production methods are more specialized. Production and
   marketing are more vertically and horizontally integrated.
   Concentration characterized by sharp declines in the number of buyers
   or sellers of a product is greater. Consumer preferences, new
   technology, and global markets bring about continuing change affects
   farmers, processors, marketers, and consumers.

   Congressional Support:
   The ability of ARS to respond to the many and diverse needs of
   producers and consumers is determined by the Appropriations Act. As a
   consequence of inflation and higher operating costs associated with
   advances in research equipment and technology, the ARS scientific
   workforce, which reached a maximum of about 3,400 scientists in 1970,
   decreased by almost 40 percent during the ensuing 25 years. More
   recently, appropriations have allowed the Agency to expand its research
   program and hire additional scientists. Because of widespread concern
   about managing the Federal budget surpluses to reduce the debt and
   maintain the long-term viability of the Social Security Trust Funds and
   selected mandatory programs, future discretionary budgets including ARS
   are expected to remain relatively tight.

   Drug-Free Workplace:
   ARS will continue to use the applicable contract clauses and
   regulations to ensure compliance with drug-free workplace debarment and
   suspension requirements in all of its acquisition programs.

   General Comments:
   In January 1998, ARS requested permission from the Office of Management
   and Budget (OMB) "to describe specific and tangible products, steps,
   intermediate goals, and/or accomplishments that will demonstrate that
   the Agency has successfully met each Performance Measure/Goal in a
   given fiscal year." With OMBs concurrence, the ARS was able to use
   narrative descriptions of intermediate outcomes and indicators of
   progress instead of numerical metrics as specified in GPRA. The
   indicators shown represent intermediate outcomes, significant products
   or anticipated impacts of the Agencys work which will serve as
   measurable milestones during FY 2001 and FY 2002. The research and
   technology transfer activities listed in this exhibit are not all
   inclusive of the Agencys work. The indicators reflect but do not
   adequately capture the broad range of basic research that underpins
   most of the Agencys work. The following qualitative indicators are
   specific accomplishments that the Agency anticipates achieving in the
   designated fiscal year, which constitute milestones or indicators of
   progress towards meeting the Agencys goals, objectives, and
   initiatives.

   Only Federal employees were involved in the preparation of this plan.
