   Basic Search Techniques

   FCC Search uses a powerful commercial search engine with intuitive,
   familiar functionality that makes it easy to use to get meaningful
   results. Just type in a few words or phrases. Try to use discriminating
   terms that are likely to be found only in the documents you seek. The
   more words you give, the better results you'll get. Here are some
   examples:

   Search by typing words and phrases

   Pentium computer with 8x CD-ROM for sale

   FCC Search will find documents containing as many of these words and
   phrases as possible, ranked so that the documents most relevant to your
   query are presented first. Don't worry about missing a document because
   it doesn't have one of the words in your search -- FCC Search returns
   relevant results even if they don't contain all query terms.

   Identify phrases with quotation marks, separate with commas

   Pentium computer with "8x CD-ROM", "for sale"

   A phrase is entered using double quotation marks, and only matches
   those words which appear adjacent to each other. Separate multiple
   phrases or proper names with a comma.

   Use UPPER case to indicate exact match

   Steve Jobs, NeXT

   Search terms in lowercase will match words in any case, otherwise, an
   exact case match is used. For example, next will find matches for Next,
   next, and NeXT, whereas a query for NeXT will only match NeXT.
