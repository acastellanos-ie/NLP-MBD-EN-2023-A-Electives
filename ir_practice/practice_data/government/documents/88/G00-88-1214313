      Note: To print a PDF document, you have to click on the printer icon that
      appears on the Adobe tool bar after you have opened the file. Then click
      once on the dialog box on the left side of "Shrink to fit", and make sure
      that the Print Range selection indicates "All pages". Once you have
      completed this process, you are ready to print. Please note that a PDF
      file may take more time to print than a text document.
