               INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE COORDINATING COUNCIL

                               SEPTEMBER 2000

                                  Article I
                                   Offices

     1.1        Business Office:  IACCs business office is located at the
   office of the IACC Secretary or such other place as the Executive Board
   may designate.


                                 Article II
                                 Definitions

   2.1        General Members:  Individuals who are associated with the
   IACC but do not have voting rights.

   2.2        Infrastructure:  Basic components, both natural and built,
   necessary for our communities to function.

   2.3        Voting Members:  Individuals representing a registered
   program who have voting rights, as explained in Article III, ยง 3.2.

   2.4        Program:  A federal, state, or private organization or
   program or division thereof that has a distinct function, mission, or
   budget that relates to infrastructure development and/or maintenance.

   2.5        Written:  Communicated through letter, memorandum, or
   electronic mail.


                                 Article III
                       Membership, Voting and Meetings

   3.1        Membership:  Membership is open to anyone interested in the
   future of infrastructure in the state of Washington.

   3.2    Voting Rights:  Each program or organization that is registered
   as an IACC member is entitled to one vote.  Voting rights are reserved
   for members representing governmental programs or nonprofit
   organizations that provide financial or technical assistance to
   Washington State local governments and/or tribal governments for
   infrastructure projects.  That vote may be cast by anyone designated to
   do so by the program.  Such designation shall be in writing.  Votes may
   be cast on the following issues:

     * The election and/or removal of members of the Executive Board
       (a.k.a. Board of Directors);
     * The election and/or removal of corporate officers;
     * The merger or consolidation of the IACC;
     * General administrative issues;
     * The sale, lease, exchange, purchase, or disposition of all or some
       of the IACC property and assets;
     * The dissolution of the IACC;
     * Modification of the Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation; and
     * Other issues deemed appropriated by the Executive Board.

   3.3        Acquiring Voting Rights:  An initial list of registered
   programs was created on September 6, 2000.  The list of registered
   programs will be adopted and awarded voting rights at the November 1,
   2000 Board Meeting.  Thereafter, a program wishing to acquire IACC
   voting rights must request such rights in a letter submitted to the
   Secretary.  A majority vote of the IACC members is needed to approve
   voting rights.  A program that loses or rescinds its voting rights may
   reacquire those rights in this same manner, but the program must be
   represented at two consecutive business meetings prior to being allowed
   to vote.  The program may vote at the second of these consecutive
   business meetings.

   3.4    Program Registry:  The Secretary will maintain the official
   registry of programs associated with the IACC.  The registry will be
   updated annually.  The registry will be used to determine voting rights
   and quorums prior to action being taken by the IACC.

   3.5    Quorum:  A majority of members entitled to vote constitutes a
   quorum at a meeting of the members.  A majority of directors
   constitutes a quorum at a meeting of the Executive Board.

   3.6    Business Meetings:  IACC will have four business meetings of its
   voting members each calendar year.  General members may attend these
   meetings but may not vote on motions.  The dates and times of these
   meetings will be set for the next year at the last meeting of the
   current year or as soon thereafter as possible.

   3.7    Special Meetings/Events:  The Chair may call special meetings to
   conduct business.  The Chair must provide written explanation of the
   need for the meeting prior to or during the special meeting.  IACC may
   elect to hold events during the course of a calendar year.  Attendance
   at special meetings and events is not considered when determining the
   official attendance of a program during a calendar year.

   3.8    Attendance:  Registered programs must be represented at a
   minimum of three of the four business meetings held each calendar
   year.  Programs shall lose their voting rights if they are not
   represented at three of the four business meetings in a calendar year.
   General members are encouraged to attend the business meetings and any
   special meetings held or sponsored by IACC.

   3.9    Notice of Meetings:  The Secretary will send notice to all
   general and voting members not less than ten (10) nor more than fifty
   (50) days before the business meetings.  Notices for special meetings
   will be sent as early as possible.


                                 Article IV

   the members and the Executive Board.  The Chair may sign deeds,

   4.7        Vice-Chair Duties:  In the event that the Chair is for any
   reason unable to perform the duties of the office, the Vice-Chair
   performs the duties of the Chair, except as may be limited by the

   The Vice-Chair performs other such duties as assigned to the office by
   the Chair or the Executive Board.

   4.8        Secretary - Duties:  The Secretary is the Secretary of both

   maintains the IACC records or appoints a person or entity to maintain
   those records, and ensures that contracts and other instruments are

   throughout the year.  The Treasurer maintains all official records and
   prepares reports and forms necessary to maintaining its nonprofit
   business status, including but not limited to those required by the IRS
   and the Washington State Secretary of States Office.

   organizations, and tribal organizations.  Each of the groups will have
   one director representing them.  The number of directors may be changed

   that member may vote on all issues brought before the Executive Board.

   5.5        Election:  The directors representing the groups noted above

   removed from office by a majority vote of the Executive Board whenever
   in the Boards judgment the best interests of the IACC would be served
   by such action.  Directors, including the entire Executive Board, may
   be removed from office, with or without cause, by a two-thirds vote of
   the members entitled to vote.

   5.10    Compensation and Reimbursement:  The directors serve without

   committee.

                                  Employees
