   consumer alert --

      Beware of people (known as "Tracers") offering to help you collect your
      refund for a fee. You do not need to hire someone to collect your
      money. You can obtain your refund directly from HUD for free. If

   -   you feel that you've been misled or in some way harmed by a tracer;
       or
   -   you've been contacted by someone asking you to become a tracer, who
       you believe misled or harmed you,
   Let us know . We'll check it out.

   If you had a HUD/FHA insured mortgage, you may be eligible for a refund
   on part of your insurance premium or a share of the earnings. You can
   search the database by name or by case number.

   To search on a name enter the "Lastname Firstname MI". If you are not
   sure of the correct spelling just type in the first few letters of the
   last name. For example, you could enter SMITH JOHN E, SMITH, or even
   SMI. If you want to search by FHA case number, be sure to include the
   dash after the first 3 digits.

   If your name is on the list, call our support center at (800) 697-6967
   to inquire about a refund. If your name is not on the list, but you
   believe that you are owed a refund, call this same toll free number to
   ask about your status.
