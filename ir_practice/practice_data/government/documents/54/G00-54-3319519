                        Digital Tectonic Activity Map

   The Digital Tectonic Activity Map (DTAM) is a new visualization tool
   for both researcher and educator alike to better understand tectonic
   activity of our planet for the past 1 million years. DTAM is a
   Geographical Information System (GIS) that displays a realistic
   synoptic view of present global tectonism by filling in the
   cartographic gap between conventional geological maps and plate
   reconstruction maps. The DTAM was created using current global datasets
   of seismicity, volcanism, and plate motions that were integrated with
   topography and bathymetry measurements derived from satellite gravity
   data. Macroscopic structural features were integrated via field studies
   from various researchers, space geodesy, and space-borne imagery (e.g.
   astronaut photography, Landsat). This integrative technique provides a
   new and unique visualization tool that presents an actual
   representational view of global tectonics rather than the traditional
   schematic illustrations (i.e. plate maps) of the past.
