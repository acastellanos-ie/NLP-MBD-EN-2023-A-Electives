   The Office of Inspector General maintains a Hotline to receive

   Contact the RRB/OIG Hotline if you are aware that:

     -  someone is receiving RRB administered retirement or
     unemployment-sickness benefits to which he or she is not entitled;

     -  a person responsible for the financial affairs of a minor or
     other RRB benefit recipients who are unable to manage their own
     affairs is misappropriating the benefits;

     -  a doctor, hospital or other provider of health care services is
     performing unnecessary or inappropriate services or billing Medicare
     for services not provided.

   Contact the Hotline to report any suspected misconduct by an RRB
   employee.

   Please do not call the Hotline with questions about eligibility
   requirements, delayed payments, or similar problems.  Such matters
   should be directed to the nearest Railroad Retirement Board field
   office .
