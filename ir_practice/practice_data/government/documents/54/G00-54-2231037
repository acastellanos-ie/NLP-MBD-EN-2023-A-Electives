   MPEGs of our Seismology Work

                               EES-11Logo

   The following MPEGs document the Los Alamos/SMU mine blasting
   experiments in 1995 and 1996 as described in the report entitled
   "Reducing the Ambiguity and Visibility of Seismic Signals from Mining
   Activities." For a copy of this report, more MPEGs, and PDF documents
   related to our research, please visit our academic collaborator, David
   Anderson, at SMU.

     __________________________________________________________________

   16 June 1995 - This MPEG taken from within the pit of the coal mine is
   of a large cast blast. Video of the explosion has been deinterlaced and
   time tagged. (1.5 MB)
   16 June 1995 - Waveforms Observed ground motions and a model of the
   blast (turns from white to red at design shot time) have been
   superimposed and time correlated with the video images of the
   explosion. (2.4 MB)
   16 June 1995 Model - A model depicting the generation and propagation
   of the compressional energy resulting from the detonation of each of
   the individual borehole in the 16 June explosion. The design shot times
   of the explosion were used to create the visualization. (2.0 MB)
   13 November 1995 - This MPEG movie taken from within the pit of the
   coal mine is of a large cast blast. Video of the explosion has been
   deinterlaced and time tagged. (2.3 MB)
   13 November 1995 Waveforms - Observed ground motions and acoustic
   waveforms and a model of the blast (turns from white to red at design
   shot time) have been superimposed and time correlated with the video
   images of the explosion. Note the large peak amplitude at late time in
   the ground motions which is reflective of the simultaneous detonation
   of several boreholes towards the end of the shot. (4.1 MB)
   13 November 1995 Model - A model depicting the generation and
   propagation of the compressional energy resulting from the detonation
   of each of the individual borehole in the 13 Nov explosion. The
   simultaneous detonation of several boreholes at the end of the shot is
   depicted. (2.0 MB)
   11 March 1995 Spoils - This MPEG movie taken from the spoils pile
   overlooking the pit is of a large cast blast. Video of the explosion
   has been deinterlaced and time tagged. (3.1 MB)
   01 August 1996 - This MPEG movie taken from the spoils pile overlooking
   the pit is of a large cast blast. Video of the explosion has been
   deinterlaced and time tagged. (1.9 MB)
   Primary and Auxiliary Seismic Stations - This MPEG movie represents the
   Primary and Auxiliary seismic stations proposed as part of the
   International Monitoring System for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
   As the globe turns the model zooms into a mine in NE Wyoming where
   video from a large explosion is played. Explosions such as this one may
   produce seismic signals that will be detected by some of the seismic
   stations in the International Monitoring System. (2.2 MB)
   The Tyrnyauz Blast - These images document mining practices in a moly
   mine of the former Soviet Union in Tyrnyauz, Georgia. This blast used
   bore holes approximately 12 inches in diameter and 36 feet deep loaded
   with ANFO explosive. The holes were not stemmed (backfilled) and thus
   produced huge airblasts. (.4 MB)
   Tyrnyauz Blast Model - This model simulates a 500 frames per second
   slow motion film of the Tyrnyauz moly mine blast, including the
   row-by-row delay times and the sequential firing of the explosive
   charges. The blue rings represent the seismic wavefronts moving out at
   about 3000 meters per second. The yellow rings represent the
   accompanying slower airblasts. (.5 MB)
   Multi-Shot Experiment - American open-pit coal mine blasting. This
   experiment studied a small 4x4 array shot which was heavily
   instrumented both at close range and regional distances. Velocity
   gauges and accelerometers as well as velocity-of-detonation recorders
   (VODR) and hi-speed film and video cameras were used to form combined
   data sets used to quantify seismic source processes. This is not really
   a movie, just 6 stills in MPEG format. (550K)
   Multi-Shot Blast - Digitized video has been de-interlaced and
   de-jittered to produce half-speed images of the blast. This then is
   combined with ground motion data collected from 3-axis accelerometers
   installed near the camera locations. Note the coupling (or lack) of the
   ripple fired charges as they go off in sequence. Note also how little
   seismic energy is generated from the re-impacting of the lofted
   material. (470K)
   Multi-Shot Model - The ground motions and detonation timing are
   combined in this computer model of the multiple shot sequence. Three
   axis ground motion waveforms are displayed with a moving cursor for
   temporal reference. Timing delays deviate from those designed by the
   blaster as documented by down-hole VODR and hi-speed film analysis.
