                      "Build and Grow Our Workforce to
                      Guarantee Scientific Excellence"

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is committed to the vision of being a
   world leader in the natural sciences through scientific excellence and
   responsiveness to society's needs. Enhancing the skills of the our
   workforce is imperative as we move into the future because our ability
   to succeed in our science mission and to sustain the USGS' vision
   depends on the skills of our people.

   Employee development is a critical part of achieving the Bureau's
   mission, vision, and strategic goals. As part of the strategic changes
   implementation, the Office of Employee Development was established on
   October 8, 2000.

   Our goal is to develop and retain our most treasured assetpeopleto
   achieve excellent scientific and technical performance.
