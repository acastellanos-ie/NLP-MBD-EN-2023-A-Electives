         KNOW FRAUD IS BROUGHT
              TO YOU BY:

         Bullet Commodity Futures Trading Commission
         Bullet Council of Better Business Bureaus
         Bullet Department of Justice
         Bullet Federal Trade Commission
         Bullet National Association of Attorneys General

   HOW IDENTITY THIEVES WORK:

   Bullet They open a new credit card account, using your name, date of
          birth, and Social Security number. When they use the credit card and
          donÂ’t pay the bills, the delinquent account is reported on your credit
          report.
   Bullet They call your credit card issuer and, pretending to be you,
          change the mailing address on your credit card account. Then, your
          imposter runs up charges on your account. Because your bills are being
          sent to the new address, you may not immediately realize there's a
          problem.
   Bullet They establish cellular phone service in your name.
   Bullet They open a bank account in your name and write bad checks on
          that account.

                          HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF:

   Bullet Before revealing personal identifying information, find out how
          it will be used and if it will be shared. Ask if you have a choice
          about the use of your information.
   Bullet Pay attention to your billing cycles. Follow up with creditors
          if bills do not arrive on time.
   Bullet Give your Social Security number only when absolutely necessary.
          Ask to use other types of identifiers when possible.
   Bullet Minimize the identification information and the number of cards
          you carry to what you actually need.
   Bullet Order a copy of your credit report from the three credit
          reporting agencies every year. Make sure it's accurate and includes
          only those activities you've authorized.
   Bullet Learn about your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
