   Following are general facts about what recycling can do.
     * 160 million tons of trash is produced each year in the US. 80% is
       presently landfilled, 10% burned, and a mere 10% is recycled.
     * Recycling one aluminum can saves the amount of energy to light one
       100 watt bulb for 20 hours of run a TV for 3 hours.
     * Americans throw away enough aluminum every three months to rebuild
       the entire US airline fleet.
     * 1 ton of recycled paper saves 3700 pounds of lumber and 24,000
       gallons of water.
     * We throw away enough glass every 2 weeks to fill both World Trade
       Center buildings to the top.
     * Incinerating 10,000 tons of waste creates 1 job, landfilling the
       same amount creates 6 jobs, recycling the same 10,000 tons creates
       36 jobs.
     * It takes 75,000 trees to print a Sunday Edition of the New York
       Times.
     * Recycling paper consumes 61% less water and 70% less energy then
       using Natural Resources.
     * Americans discard approximately 350 million gallons of motor oil
       annually. If this oil were recovered and refined, we would reduce
       petroleum imports by 25.5 million barrels of oil a year.
     * If 70 million American households bought a half-gallon container of
       milk a week, instead of two quarts, they would reduce paper discard
       by 41.6 million pounds and plastic discards by 5.7 million pounds a
       year. This would save $144.6 million in packaging, and more than 1
       trillion BTU of energy- enough to heat and cool 7,500 households
       for an entire year.
     * We throw away enough diapers every year to stretch from the Earth
       to the Moon 7 times.
     * Americans throw away enough office paper each year to build a
       12-foot-high wall of paper from New York to Los Angeles.
     * If everyone in the U.S. recycled just 1/10 of their newsprint, we
       would save the estimated equivalent of about 25 million trees a
       year.
     * Recycling just one aluminum can saves enough energy to run a
       television for 3 hours.
     * Making glass from recycled materials cuts related air pollution 20%
       and water pollution 50%.
     * When used motor oil is poured into the ground, it can seep into the
       groundwater and contaminate drinking water supplies. A single quart
       of motor oil can pollute 250,000 gallons of drinking water.
     * About half of the nation's paper, 8% of the steel, 75% of the
       glass, 40% of the aluminum, and 30% of the total plastics output
       are used solely to wrap and decorate consumer products.
