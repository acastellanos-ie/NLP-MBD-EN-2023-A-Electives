     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Directions:
    1. Select a location from the City pulldown menu, OR select "Enter
       Lat/Long ->" from the pulldown menu, and manually enter the
       latitude, longitude and time zone information in the appropriate
       text boxes. The following sign conventions are used:

                 Longitude:                      Latitude:
       Positive in Western Hemisphere Positive in Northern Hemisphere
       Negative in Eastern Hemisphere Negative in Southern Hemisphere

        Latitude and Longitude can be in deg/min/sec, or decimal degrees
       entered in the "Deg:" field. If you select a city from the pulldown
        menu, the latitude, longitude and time zone fields will be filled
       in automatically. If you want to input latitude, longitude or time
       zone manually, be sure to select "Enter Lat/Long -->" from the City
        pulldown box, or your numbers will be overwritten by the selected
                                city's location.
      2. You can enter a different time zone for a location by selecting
       "Enter Lat/Long -->" in the City pulldown box. Otherwise, the time
        zone associated with the selected city's Local Standard Time will
        be automatically entered. Selecting "Yes" in the Daylight Saving
       field will cause the resulting sunrise, sunset and solar noon times
        to be adjusted forward one hour. If you are uncertain of the time
               zone for a location, refer to our Time Zone Table.
      3. The program retrieves the current date from your computer, and
       fills the month, day and year fields. To perform calculations for a
        different date, simply select a month in the pull down menu, and
        enter the day and four digit year in the appropriate input boxes.
       When entering a day or year, you will need to click the "Calculate
           Sunrise/Sunset" button to update the results for this date.
     4. Once the calculation results are displayed, you may use your web
         browser's "Print" function to obtain a hardcopy of the results.
       5. For locations above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic
        Circle, when a sunrise or sunset does not occur on the given day
         the program locates the local time and date of the most recent
          sunrise or sunset, and the next sunset or sunrise. When this
        occurs, the UTC fields will display "prior" or "next" information
                            instead of the UTC times.
     6. NOTE: For latitudes greater than 72 degrees N and S, calculations
       are accurate to within 10 minutes. For latitudes less than +/- 72Â°
       accuracy is approximately one minute. See Solar Calculation Details
                            for further explanation.
