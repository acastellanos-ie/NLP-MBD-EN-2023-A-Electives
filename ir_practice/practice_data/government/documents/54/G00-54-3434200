                  Inviting CCIPS Attorneys to Speak to You

   Training and public outreach are at the core of the mission of the
   Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). Accordingly,
   in appropriate circumstances, CCIPS attorneys are available to provide
   training to federal, state, and law enforcement agents, prosecutors,
   other government officials, and in some cases to foreign requesters.
   CCIPS attorneys are also available to speak in the US or abroad to
   groups of private attorneys, system operators, information security
   professionals, and other organizations concerned about computer crime
   or intellectual property theft. Some representative topics include:

    Responding to the Threat of Cybercrime;
    Protecting Privacy and Public Safety Online;
    International Issues in and Efforts to Fight Computer Crime;
    Prosecuting Intellectual Property Theft (copyright infringement,
   trademark counterfeiting and theft of trade secrets);
    Protecting Trade Secrets Under the Economic Espionage Act;
    Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations and
   Searching and Seizing Computers;
    The Rights and Responsibilities of System Administrators Under The
