   Basic Science Analysis Program Banner

   The Basic Science Analysis Program (BSAP) conducts economic and policy
   analyses of scientific and technical issues. In particular, BSAP
   examines the economic and policy implications of energy research and
   development investment and conducts science policy studies. Staff
   associated with BSAP have expertise in economic research, climate
   change, fundamental science, analysis of public policy, and a broad
   range of technical areas. Program staff work closely with colleagues in
   universities and colleges, federal laboratories, and industry.

   BSAP is a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory research program. BSAPs
   research is supported by the Office of Planning and Analysis, a
   Division of the US Department of Energy's Office of Science.

Research and Analysis Focus Areas

US Energy Research and Development Investments

     Understanding the Determinants of US Energy R&D Investments. BSAP
     identified and explained the relationship between energy sector
     deregulation and energy research investment levels. This work
     resulted in a uniquely authoritative data about US public and
     private sector energy R&D investments from the first oil shock to
     the present.

International Energy Research and Development Investments

     Analyzing Energy R&D in Major Industrialized Nations. BSAP is
     exploring the current restructuring of national energy R&D programs
     in the ten largest industrialized countries that fund significant
     energy R&D efforts. This research will examine the extent to which
     these national energy R&D programs are being reoriented to focus on
     the development of technologies needed to address climate change.

Science Policy Studies

     Examining the Influence of Policy on the Conduct of Science. BSAP's
     science, technology and public policy studies provide a solid
     analytical basis for scientific and technical policy decisions made
     by the Department of Energy's Office of Science. In one study, BSAP
     analyzed the incidence of scientific misconduct in the physical
     sciences and examined ways in which scientific misconduct policies
     might impact physical science research.
