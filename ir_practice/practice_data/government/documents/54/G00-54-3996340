     A. The Computer and Telecommunications Coordinator (CTC) Program,
     Stacey Levine, USA Bulletin (May 2001)

     In 1995, at the recommendation of the then-Computer Crime Unit (now
     the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS)), the
     Department of Justice created the Computer and Telecommunication
     Coordinator (CTC) Program to protect the nation's businesses and
     citizens from the rising tide of computer crime. The CTC program has
     now grown to 137 attorneys. Each United States Attorney's Office
     (USAO) has designated at least one CTC and over thirty-five
     districts have two or more. In addition, a number of Sections in the
     Criminal Division and other Divisions of Justice also have
     designated CTCs. The CTCs have four general areas of responsibility:

     B.   The Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (CHIP) Units

     As announced by Attorney General John Ashcroft on July 20, 2001,
     nine additional units are being added to a program called CHIP
     (Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property) that has proven
     successful in Northern California. That project demonstrated the
     benefits of a unit of prosecutors working closely with the FBI and
     other agencies to establish a relationship with the local high tech
     community and encourage them to refer cases to law enforcement. The
     new CHIP units are the next phase in the Department's ongoing
     efforts to combat cybercrime and Intellectual Property theft. In
     1991, the Department created what is now the Computer Crime and
     Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) in the Criminal Division. The
     CHIP team members will complement the highly trained network of
     prosecutors at CCIPS and the US Attorneys Offices. More information
     on the CHIP units is accessible via the links below:

     Cybercrime Summit:  A Law Enforcement/Information Technology
     Industry Dialogue

     On April 5, 2000, the Department of Justice hosted a Cybercrime
     Summit at Stanford Law School, titled "Cybercrime Summit:A Law
     Enforcement/Information Technology Industry Dialogue on Prevention,
     Detection, Investigation and Cooperation," at which Attorney General
     Janet Reno and members of the Justice Department and other law
     enforcement agencies met with  representatives of information
     technology and Internet companies.  The main topic of the Summit was
     how to improve cooperation between law enforcement and industry in
     investigating computer network hacking.  Linked below are the

     The Cybercitizen Partnership:  Industry and Government Alliance

     On March 15, 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno announced a new
     Cybercitizen Partnership, a new alliance between law enforcement and
     the technology community.  The goal of the partnership is to
     coordinate the efforts of government, industry and the public to
     ensure public safety and responsible computer use.  The partnership
     will also promote computer ethics and civic responsibility in the
     cyber age and aid law enforcement and industry in the battle
     against  "on-line outlaws."  The partnership will consist of three
     complementary segments.  The first segment is a "good
     cybercitizenship" public awareness campaign.  The second is a
     user-friendly computer and network security directory to help public
     and private sector organizations quickly find computer security
     resources.  The third is an Information Security Professional
     fellowship program between industry and government that will raise
     the awareness levels of participants with respect to the views,
     perspectives and needs of their respective counterparts.
