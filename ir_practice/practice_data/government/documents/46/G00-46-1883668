   The Alaska Fisheries Science Center Image Gallery is an ongoing,
   collaborative project contributed to by Center staff members. Many of
   the images include species descriptions in text format. Most of the
   photographs, illustrations, and videos on our Image Gallery web pages
   are in the public domain and are not copyrighted. However, some have
   been contributed by individuals in the private sector or  agencies
   outside the federal government and, therefore, are subject to U.S.
   copyright law.

   We ask that credit be given to the Alaska Fisheries Science
   Center/National Marine Fisheries Service when using images from our
   website, unless otherwise instructed to credit the photographer or
   other source.
