   Information Management Acronyms and Abbreviations Foreword This list of
   acronyms, initialisms, and other abbreviations stems from terms used at
   the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).
   Starting on page 139, the list includes (a) units of measure primarily
   from the International System of Units (SI)-the modern metric
   system-and from the U.S. Customary and British Imperial Systems, (b)
   chemical element symbols, and (c) miscellaneous terms. Abbreviations
   that are not units of measure or chemical symbols but that begin with a
   symbol (e.g., %C) or a number (e.g., 2,4-D) appear on page 138. This
   list cites the preferred form of an abbreviation first. For example,
   the preferred form in the entry GM or G-M is GM. When convention
   requires, abbreviations and definitions are shown in lowercase. Since
   readers can find abbreviation-filled documents hard to read, it is best
   to shorten only widely familiar terms. To provide needed definitions,
   the list includes some questionable, ill-formed, and redundant
   acronyms. To view the list electronically, access the Electronic
   Document Management home page: (a) click the Document Control link, (b)
   click Find A Document, (c) click Look-up Document by ID, (d) enter
   lst-2 and click the Submit button, and (e) click the PDF File button.
