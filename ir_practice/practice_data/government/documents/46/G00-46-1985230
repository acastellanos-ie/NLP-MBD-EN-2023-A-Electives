                                  Annual Hurricane Season Articles

                 NHC publishes three annual summaries of tropical cyclone activity in
                 its area of responsibility. These include: 1) The Atlantic Hurricane
                 Season, 2) The Eastern North Pacific Hurricane Season, and 3)
                 Atlantic Tropical Systems. The Hurricane Season summaries include
                 descriptions of named storms along with pertinent meteorological
                 data and satellite imagery. The Atlantic Tropical Systems article
                 gives a description of tropical disturbances in the Atlantic
                 (especially tropical waves) and provides information on
                 non-developing cyclones.

                 The annual summaries can be found in the following periodicals:

                 [CHANGING BALL] Mariner's Weather Log

                 [CHANGING BALL] Monthly Weather Review

                 [CHANGING BALL] Weatherwise

                 These journals can be found in your public library or university
                 library. The Monthly Weather Review and Weatherwise are found in the
                 science section, while the Mariner's Weather Log is found in the
                 Government Documents section under the Department of Commerce.

                 Atlantic Hurricane Season Summaries can be found in the Monthly
                 Weather Review back to the 1930's, with descriptions of individual
                 storms available back to the start of the journal in 1886. The are
                 found in the other to journals for as long as they have been around.
                 Eastern Pacific Hurricane Season Summaries (including those from the
                 former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in Redwood City, CA) are
                 available in all the journals dating back to the early 1960's.

                 The Atlantic Tropical Systems article dates back to the 1970's, with
                 a break in the publication from 1980 to 1988. It is found only in
                 the Monthly Weather Review.
