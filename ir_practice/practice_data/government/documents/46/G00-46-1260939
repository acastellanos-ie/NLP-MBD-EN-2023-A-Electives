   Cotton Production Model

   Background
   - Over the last 30 years, the U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA)
   Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has conducted a wide range of
   research on cotton, including work to develop a series of "production
   models" designed to serve as decision aids to cotton producers. In
   1996, ARS decided to develop a new "second generation" Cotton
   Production Model (CPM) that would retain the best features of the
   earlier versions in a new, more versatile, and more user friendly
   framework. The development process was completed to the stage of
   beta-testing, when the need to redirect limited resources to other
   priorities caused ARS to decide not to complete the validation process.

   ARS believes that CPM, while only partially validated, has the
   potential to make useful contributions to American cotton producers
   when completed. For these reasons, ARS decided to make the model
   available for further development and commercialization.

   Unconditional Release
   - The model is now being released at no cost to the public for further
   development. ARS is releasing the CPM so that interested parties can
   continue to develop the model for their own needs and purposes. ARS
   does not foresee providing monetary or technical support to refine,
   adapt, or use this model, and provides no warranty for its use for any
   purpose. ARS does not reserve any rights or interests in the work that
   may be performed by others to refine or adapt it. ARS does reserve the
   right to continue its own refinement of the current version of the
   model at a later date, should program needs require it.

   Information on CPM
   - A new process-based cotton model, CPM, has been developed to simulate
   the growth and development of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   throughout the growing season with minimal data input. CPM predicts
   final cotton yield for any combination of soil, weather, cultivar and
   sequence of management actions.

   The personal computer system requirements to run CPM are minimal,
   requiring IBM-compatibility, Windows95+, 64K RAM, and 4Mb hard disk
   space.

   ARS believes that CPM has the potential to be useful as a decision aid
   for cotton producers and crop consultants. If fully developed, it would
   be a valuable tool to optimize management inputs such as irrigation,
   fertilization, plant growth regulators, and defoliant application prior
   to harvest. In its current version, however, CPM has not yet been fully
   validated to be useful as a decision aid. The released version should
   be considered an advanced model suitable for research purposes. ARS
   does not endorse its use for any other purpose at this time.
