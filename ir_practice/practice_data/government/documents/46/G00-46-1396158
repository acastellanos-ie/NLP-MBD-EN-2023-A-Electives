                   Lieberman, McCain Call for Commission to
                        Investigate Terrorist Attacks
        -Senators Introduce Legislation to Create Bipartisan Board of
                                   Inquiry-

   WASHINGTON - Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman,
   D-Conn., and Senator John McCain, R-Ariz., Thursday introduced
   legislation that would create a bipartisan commission to investigate
   the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attacks of September 11,
   2001, and evaluate the United States' preparedness and response to the
   attacks.

   "We want this commission to be nonpartisan and independent," Lieberman
   said. "It must be a hunt for the truth, not a witch hunt. The initial
   weeks and months after September 11 were - understandably and
   appropriately -preoccupied with mourning and healing, and then with the
   war on terrorism. But since the first stage of the war is now drawing
   to a close with the defeat of the Taliban - and with many perplexing
   questions left unanswered - this is the right time to begin in earnest
   the process of finding answers to our questions.

   "To prevent future tragedies, we need a thorough, nonpartisan,
   independent inquiry into what happened on September 11th, and what we
   can do to protect our people and our institutions against the enemies
   of freedom in the future," said McCain. "I am confident that with the
   President's support, this commission's recommendations can serve as a
   guidepost for the reform and invigoration of America's homeland
   defenses."

   The bill would establish the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks
   Upon the United States, composed of 14 appointed members. Four members,
   including the Commission's chairperson, will be named by the President,
   and ten members will be selected by Congressional committee chairs. No
   more than seven members may be of the same political party.

   The Commission will report on its findings, conclusions, and
   recommendations, including proposing organization, coordination,
   planning, management arrangements, procedures, rules and regulations,
   to the President and Congress twice - initially, six months after the
   Commission holds its first meeting, and again no more than one year
   after the submission of the first report. The primary functions of the
   Commission will be:
   Conduct an investigation into the facts and circumstances relating to
   the attacks of September 11, 2001, including any relevant legislation,
   executive order, regulation, plan, practice, or procedure
   Review and evaluate the lessons learned from the terrorist attacks
   regarding the structure, coordination, and management arrangement of
   the Federal Government in detecting, preventing, and responding to
   terrorist attacks

     FLOOR STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN McCAIN ON LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH
     THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TERRORIST ATTACKS UPON THE UNITED STATES

   December 20, 2001

   I am pleased to join my friend Joe Lieberman in introducing legislation
   calling for a blue-ribbon commission to examine the facts surrounding
   the September 11th attacks, and to propose reforms to better defend our
   country in the future.

   After Pearl Harbor and President Kennedy's assassination, the President
   and Congress established boards of inquiry to investigate these
   tragedies and recommend measures to prevent their recurrence.

   The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington represent a watershed
   in American history the end of an era of general peace and prosperity,
   and a terrible awakening to the threats against our people that lurk
   within, and beyond, our shores.

   To prevent future tragedies, we need to know how September 11th could
   have happened, and explore what we can do to be sure America never
   again suffers such an attack on her soil.

   I believe President Bush and his team have responded forcefully,
   admirably, and with a sense of purpose in this time of trial. But
   neither the Administration nor Congress is capable of conducting a
   thorough, nonpartisan, independent inquiry into what happened on
   September 11th, or to propose far-reaching reforms needed to protect
   our people and our institutions against the enemies of freedom.

   As we did after Pearl Harbor and the Kennedy assassination, we need a
   blue-ribbon team of distinguished Americans from all walks of life to
   thoroughly investigate all evidence surrounding the attacks, including
   how prepared we were and how well we responded to this unprecedented
   assault.

   It will require digging deep into the resources of the full range of
   government agencies. It will demand objective judgment into what went
   wrong, what we did right, and what else we need to do to deter and
   defeat depraved assaults against innocent lives in the future.

   This is no witch hunt. Our enemies would be strengthened if their
   attacks caused us to turn on ourselves, consumed not with the
   malevolence of our foes but with our own failings.

   We are a proud nation, a strong nation. However horrible, September
   11th reminded us of our love of country, our fierce patriotic pride. It
   highlighted the distinctive accomplishments of our civilization, and
   the sacrifices we will endure to defend it against evil. It made us
   stronger.

   That said, if there were serious failures on the part of individuals or
   institutions within the government or the private sector, we have a
   right to know, indeed a need to know. But to work, this must be a
   learning exercise, without preconceptions about the inquiry's ultimate
   findings.

   The commission's members should include leading citizens not now
   holding public office, but with broad experience in national affairs.
   The commission should have an adequate budget, a top-level staff, and
   ample investigatory resources -- including subpoena power, if it is
   needed to uncover the truth.

   To be effective and legitimate, the commission should be given a broad
   mandate to discover facts and recommend corrective actions. It should
   be given time to proceed with care and deliberation. It should have the
   stature and significance afforded by its grave mission of telling the
   whole truth about September 11th, and telling us what we need to know
   to protect against future tragedy.

   To be credible, this inquiry must be independent from ongoing
   government operations, but it must of necessity draw on the resources
   of government. The commission's conclusions and recommendations will
   have enduring meaning only if they are valued by those of us who can
   set them in motion -- the President, the Congress, and all concerned
   Americans.

   Our best defense now lies in pursuing our enemy overseas, and working
   here at home to adapt to the challenges of this new day. We can rid the
   world of terrorism's scourge. But it will take time, and our campaign
   will likely inspire further, desperate tests of our resolve.

   More Americans may die before we are through. In this moment when we
   enjoy peace at home, even as brave Americans risk their lives for us
   overseas, let us marshal our resolve to defend our homeland, not merely
   through force of arms, but through reasoned introspection into how
   September 11th happened, what we've learned, and how we can apply those
   lessons to the defense of the American people.

   More than two years ago, the bipartisan Hart-Rudman Commission on
   National Security envisioned a time when terrorists and rogue nations
   would acquire weapons of mass destruction and "mass disruption."

   "Americans will likely die on American soil," the Commission warned,
   "possibly in large numbers."

   That time has come. The worst has happened. But it must not happen
   again. We hope history will judge America well for her response to
   September 11th -- the incredible bravery of so many Americans, and the
   measures we have already put in place to prevent future acts of
   catastrophic terrorism.

   This commission is an integral part of our response to the attacks of
   September 11th. Its mission is urgent. The American people clearly
   share our sense of urgency about protecting our country. I hope our
   proposed commission can channel that sense of urgency into a mandate
   for reform of the way we defend America.
