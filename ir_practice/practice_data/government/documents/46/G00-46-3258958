                                     Overview

      What is in situ?

      In situ means "in its natural or original position or place." Many JPL
      missions use remote sensing to gather data. Remote sensing refers to
      the activities of recording/observing/perceiving (sensing) objects or
      events at far away (remote) places. In remote sensing, the sensors are
      not in direct contact with the objects or events being observed. For
      example, a spacecraft, such as the Mars Global Surveyor, orbits the Red
      Planet, uses sophisticated cameras and other technology to collect data
      remotely, and then transmits the data back to Earth to be interpreted
      by scientists. By contrast, in situ missions or experiments will use
      instruments, such as miniature mass spectrometers, ultrasonic drills
      and corers, sensors, "Cryobots," and other emerging instruments to take
      measurements, record data, and collect samples at the actual physical
      site. Sample return missions will return samples to Earth, where
      scientists will then study and analyze the samples to expand our
      knowledge of the Solar System.

      What is CISSR?

      The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has established internal "Centers of
      Excellence" in order to meet NASA's programmatic commitments. The areas
      of these Centers reflect NASA's desire for JPL to be the Center of
      Excellence in Deep Space Systems. In addition, JPL has a major emerging
      role in NASA's Origins Program and is a supporting Center for Earth
      Instruments. To fulfill these roles, JPL must become a leader in the
      area of in situ exploration and sample return.

      NASA's space science missions will increasingly rely on in situ
      characterization of the atmosphere, surface and subsurface regions of
      planets, satellites, and small bodies. To accomplish the goals of these
      exploration missions, novel devices and approaches are needed for
      sample acquisition, for transfer to sample collection sites or sample
      return vehicles, and for positioning of instruments. Innovative science
      payload approaches are also needed for in situ measurements of the
      atmosphere, surface, and subsurface.

      JPL's Center for In Situ Exploration and Sample Return (CISSR) was
      formed to coordinate, focus and enhance JPL's scientific,
      technological, and system development capabilities for in situ
      exploration and sample return missions and experiments. CISSR is also
      establishing highly interactive teaming relationships with NASA
      Centers, Government Laboratories, Industry and Academia to meet the
      challenges of these technologies and missions.
