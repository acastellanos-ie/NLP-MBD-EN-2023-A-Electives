Overview of How to Navigate

   Looking at the top of this page, you see the top main navigation bar,
   giving you direct links to the most requested information: Opinions,
   Forms, Rules, Courts, Programs, Jobs, Reference, and Search. The main
   navigation bar never changes and is always present at the top of every
   page. For more information, proceed to "Exploring the Top Main
   Navigation Bar."

   Looking at the left side of this page, you see the left navigation bar,
   giving you links to subsections which change depending on where you are
   in the Web site. For example, the left navigation on this page provides
   links to the subsections that can only be reached from the home page.
   If you click on a button from the left navigation bar, it may change
   again to provide links to other sections within the subsections. If you
   click on a button from the top main navigation bar, the left navigation
   will change and display the buttons to the subsections for that area,
   if that area has subsections.

   At the bottom of the left navigation bar, you will always find the
   "C|C" image. This is the California Courts logo that will take you back
   to the home page if clicked.
