   Habits of Service

   TVA retirees are a special bunch. Their work at TVA in service to the
   people of the Tennessee Valley has fostered habits of public
   responsibility and concern that stick with them for the rest of their
   lives.

   [retiree_15a.jpg] More than 8,000 TVA retirees and beneficiaries of the
   TVA Retirement System are members of the TVA Retirees Association.
   Independent of TVA and the Retirement System, TVARA works closely with
   both to ensure that retirees interests are served by TVA benefit
   programs. TVARA also keeps retirees in touch with issues they care
   about, and helps them increase public knowledge of and support for TVA
   programs.

   Through a separate organization, Bicentennial Volunteers Inc., retirees
   can offer ongoing volunteer service to TVA and other agencies across
   the region.

   In short, TVAs retiree organizations keep former employees in touch
   with the forward-looking, service-oriented TVA way of life.

   and retirees when they choose electric energy. Learn more about these

   Traveling Man
   BVI volunteer Cecil Thomas and his wife, Reva, like to get aroundby
   van, by plane, even by snowmobile each winter in Yellowstone National
   Park. And when natural disasters strike in distant places, Thomas also
   hits the road to help out. LifeTimes tells his story.

   For the Love of Learning
   Winter is the perfect time to take that woodcarving course you've
   always thought about or study up on your favorite musicians or writers.
