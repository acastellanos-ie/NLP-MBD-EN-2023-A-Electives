   Abandoned Mine Lands

      Thousands of historical hard-rock (gold, copper, and zinc) mines exist
      across the Western United States. Mine dumps, tailing piles, and
      unmined mineral deposits can contaminate the surrounding watershed when
      weathering of exposed minerals causes acid drainage and metals-enriched
      waters. Research, focusing on the processes that affect migration of
      contamination and ecological effects, are underway in watersheds with
      differing climate and hydrologic settings. Results are being used and
      demonstrated through the USGS Abandoned Mine Lands Initiative.
