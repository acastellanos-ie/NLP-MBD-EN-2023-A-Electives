   Preparing Your Family For A Disaster

   When preparing for a disaster, plan on having enough supplies to get
   you and your family through at least the first 72 hours (3 days).
   There's a good chance traditional emergency response teams will be too
   busy to take care of you and your family during the first 72 hours
   after a disaster. You need to prepare yourself, home, neighborhood, and
   business.

                                [family.jpg]

   The Plan


   Stock up on a 3-day supply of food, water, clothes, medical supplies
   and other necessary equipment for everyone in your family. Make sure
   everyone knows where these supplies are stored. (See the emergency
   supplies information on the other side of this sheet.)

   Decide where and when your family will reunite should you be separated
   when a disaster occurs.

   Choose a person outside the immediate area to  contact if family
   members are separated.  Long distance phone servicewill probably be
   restored sooner than local service. Do not use the phone immediately
   after a disaster.

   Know the policies  of  the school or day care center
   your children attend. Make plans to have someone pick them up if you
   are unable to get to them.

   If  you  have  a  family  member  who does not  speak English, prepare
   an emergency card written
   in English indicating that person's identification,
   address and any special needs such as medication or allergies. Tell
   that person to keep the card with him/her at all times.

   Conduct Emergency drills and review your emergency plan every six
   months with your family and business.

   Know the safest places in your home and place of work.

   Locate the shutoff valves for water, gas and electricity. Learn how to
   shut off the valves before a disaster.   If you have any questions,
   call your
   utility company.

   Take photos/videos of valuables. Make copies of vital records and keep
   them in a safe location in another city or state.

   (Make sure originals are stored in a fire, water,
   and theft safe place.)

   Make hard copy printouts of all computer stored documents.  You won't
   have access to your computer during power outages.

   Exercise with your family all possible ways to exit your house and work
   place. Keep those areas clear.

   Know the locations of the nearest Fire and Police Stations.

   Include your baby-sitter and other house-hold help in your plans.

   Keep extra cash and change. If electricity is out, you will not be able
   to use an ATM.
