  Obit

   Our love will not come back on fortune's wheel--
   in the end it gets us, though a man know what he'd have:
   old cars, old money, old undebased pre-Lyndon
   silver, no copper rubbing through . . . old wives;
   I could live such a too long time with mine.
   In the end, every hypochondriac is his own prophet.
   Before the final coming to rest, comes the rest
   of all transcendence in a mode of being, hushing
   all becoming. I'm for and with myself in my otherness,
   in the eternal return of earth's fairer children,
   the lily, the rose, the sun on brick at dusk,
   the loved, the lover, and their fear of life,
   their unconquered flux, insensate oneness, painful "It was. . . ."
   After loving you so much, can I forget
   you for eternity, and have no other choice?

  Robert Lowell
