   to PAC2001 Home
     __________________________________________________________________

   We invite you to support the conference by taking a booth at the 2001
   Particle Accelerator Conference Industrial Exhibit. Particle
   Accelerator Conferences are held every two years at different locations
   in North America and always include an Industrial Exhibit where
   international companies can advertise their products and expertise. The
   conference will cover new developments in all aspects of the science,
   technology, and use of accelerators. It should also provide a channel
   of communications for accelerator scientists and engineers and persons
   concerned with the applications of accelerators. We anticipate that
   approximately 1000 scientists and engineers who specialize in the
   design and use of accelerators will attend.
