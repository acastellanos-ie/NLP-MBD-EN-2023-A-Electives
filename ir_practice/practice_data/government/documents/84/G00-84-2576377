   Poster Page

   Some of the statutes and regulations enforced by agencies within the
   Department of Labor require that notices be posted in the workplace.
   The Department provides electronic copies of the required posters. Some
   of the Department of Labor's posters are available in languages other
   than English. They are also available in electronic form.

   Please note that posting requirements vary by statute; that is, not all
   employers are covered by each of the Department's statutes and thus may
   not be required to post a specific notice. For example, some small
   businesses may not be covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act and
   thus would not be subject to the Act's posting requirements. For
   information on coverage, visit the Employment Laws Assistance for
   Workers and Small Business (elaws) Poster Advisor or the Summary of
   Laws, Regulations and Technical Assistance Services is a good starting
   point and will provide links to pages containing more detailed
   information.

   For information about poster requirements, or for assistance in
   obtaining posters, read our workplace poster requirements for small
   businesses and other employers.
