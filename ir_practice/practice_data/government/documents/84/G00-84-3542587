      CSB screens and periodically reviews links to external websites for
      inclusion in Chemlinks. This is done as a service to our customers.
      However, the inclusion of such links in no way constitutes endorsement
      of those sites. Commercial sites are also included as a service to our
      users. This does not imply a CSB endorsement of any products or
      services offered by these commercial websites. If you discover a
      "broken link" or have other comments about links to external websites,
      please send your comments to us. If you would like to propose a site
      for inclusion on our list, please use this form.
