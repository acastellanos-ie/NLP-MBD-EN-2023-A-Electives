   DOT HS 809 090 Traffic Safety Facts 1999 U.S. Department of
   Transportation National Highway Traffic Occupant Protection Safety
   Administration Restraint Use Laws The U.S. Department of
   Transportation's July 1984 rulemaking on automatic occupant protection
   began a wave of legislative action that resulted in the enactment of
   safety belt use laws in many states. The goal of those laws is to
   promote belt use and thereby reduce deaths and injuries in motor
   vehicle crashes. The first mandatory belt use law was enacted in the
   State of New York in 1984. As of December 1999, 49 states and the
   District of Columbia had belt use laws in effect. The laws differ from
   state to state, according to the type and age of the vehicle, occupant
   seating position, etc. In 33 of the states with belt use laws in 1999,
   the law specified secondary enforcement. That is, police officers are
   permitted to write a citation only after a vehicle is stopped for some
   other traffic infraction. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia
   had laws that allowed primary enforcement, enabling officers to stop
   vehicles and write citations whenever they observe violations of the
   belt law. A 1995 NHTSA study, Safety Belt Use Laws: An Evaluation of
   Primary "Safety belts, when Enforcement and Other Provisions, indicates
   that states with primary used, reduce the risk enforcement safety belt
   laws achieved significantly higher belt use than did those with
   secondary enforcement laws. The analysis suggests that belt use of
   fatal injury to among fatally injured occupants was at least 15 percent
   higher in states front-seat passenger with primary enforcement laws.
   car occupants by 45 percent." The first mandatory child restraint use
   law was implemented in the State of Tennessee in 1978. Since 1985, all
   50 states and the District of Columbia have had child restraint use
   laws in effect. These laws also cover various segments of the
   population. Restraint System Effectiveness Research has found that
   lap/shoulder safety belts, when used, reduce the risk of fatal injury
   to front-seat passenger car occupants by 45 percent and the risk of
   moderate-to-critical injury by 50 percent. For light truck occupants,
   safety belts reduce the risk of fatal injury by 60 percent and
   moderate-to-critical injury by 65 percent. Recent NHTSA analyses
   indicate an overall fatality-reducing effectiveness for air bags of 11
   percent. Research on the effectiveness of child safety seats has found
   them to reduce fatal injury by 71 percent for infants (less than 1 year
   old) and by 54 percent for toddlers (1-4 years old) in passenger cars.
   For infants and toddlers in light trucks, the corresponding reductions
   are 58 percent and 59 percent, respectively. National Center for

   Belt Use Starting in 1994, NHTSA revised its method for calculating
   lives saved by safety belts. The note at the bottom of the following
   page explains the new method. The estimates in Table 1 and Figure 1
   reflect this revision. In 1999, 32,061 occupants of passenger vehicles
   (cars, light trucks, vans, and utility vehicles) were killed in motor
   vehicle traffic crashes, 77 percent of the 41,611 traffic fatalities
   reported for the year. Among passenger vehicle occupants over 4 years
   old, safety belts saved "From 1975 through an estimated 11,197 lives in
   1999. 1999, an estimated At the high use rates achieved in other
   countries (85 percent), safety belts 123,213 lives could have saved the

   safety belts." If ALL passenger vehicle occupants over age 4 wore
   safety belts, 20,750 lives (that is, an additional 9,553) could have
   been saved in 1999. The 1996 NHTSA study, Crash Outcome Data Evaluation
   System (CODES), linked traffic and medical records in seven states to
   assess total costs of injury from motor vehicle crashes. The study
   found that the average inpatient costs for crash victims who were not
   using safety belts were 55 percent higher than for those who were
   belted. Figure 1. Cumulative Estimated Number of Lives Saved by Safety

   Occupant Protection 3 Ejection from the vehicle is one of the most
   injurious events that can happen to a person in a crash. In fatal
   crashes, 75 percent of passenger car occupants who were totally ejected
   from the vehicle were killed. Safety belts are effective in preventing
   total ejections: only 1 percent of the occupants reported to have been
   using restraints were totally ejected, compared with 22 percent of the
   unrestrained occupants. Air Bags In 1995, NHTSA revised its method for
   calculating lives saved by air bags. The estimates in Table 1 reflect
   this revision. Air bags, combined with lap/shoulder safety belts, offer
   the most effective safety protection available today for passenger
   vehicle occupants. It is estimated that, as of 1999, more than 91
   million air-bag-equipped passenger vehicles were on the road, including
   65 million with dual air bags. "Between 1987 and In 1999, an estimated
   1,263 lives were saved by air bags. From 1987 to 1999, a total of 4,969
   lives were saved. 1999, 4,969 lives were saved by air bags." Beginning
   September 1997 (model year 1998), all new passenger cars were required
   to have driver and passenger air bags, along with manual lap/shoulder
   safety belts. The same requirement applies to light trucks beginning in
   September 1998. Air bags are supplemental protection and are not
   designed to deploy in all crashes. Most are designed to inflate in a
   moderate-to-severe frontal crash. Some crashes at lower speeds may
   result in injuries, but generally not the serious injuries that air
   bags are designed to prevent. For this and other reasons, lap/shoulder
   belts should always be used, even in a vehicle with an air bag.
   Children in rear-facing child seats should not be placed in the front
   seat of vehicles equipped with passenger-side air bags. The impact of a
   deploying air bag striking a rear-facing child seat could result in
   injury to the child. Benefits of Child Restraint Use In 1999, there
   were 550 passenger vehicle occupant fatalities among children under 5
   years of age. Of these 550 fatalities, an estimated 291 (or 53 percent)
   were totally unrestrained. Among children under 5 years old, an
   estimated 307 lives were saved in 1999 by child restraint use. Of these
   307 lives saved, 277 were associated with the use of child safety seats
   and 30 with the use of adult belts. In 1994, NHTSA revised its method
   of estimating lives saved by safety belts. The previous method
   incorporated survey data from states with and without belt use laws.
   The current method relies on police- reported restraint use information
   for each individual occupant fatality. In addition, the estimate now
   includes lives saved in passenger vehicles at ALL seating positions,
   where previously it had been front outboard positions only. Both
   methods address only occupants age 5 years and older; younger occupants
   should be restrained by child safety seats or booster seats, as
   appropriate. National Center for Statistics & Analysis u Research &

   Traffic Safety Facts 1999 - Occupant Protection At 100 percent child
   safety seat use for children under 5, an estimated 469 lives (that is,
   an additional 162) could have been saved in 1999. Over the period 1975
   through 1999, an estimated 4,500 lives were saved by child restraints.

   Restraint Use According to observational surveys conducted by the
   states and reported to NHTSA, 67 percent of passenger vehicle occupants
   used their safety belts in 1999. The reported restraint use rate among
   all occupants of passenger cars involved in fatal crashes was 57
   percent in 1999. The use rate for drivers was higher (61 percent), and
   the highest use rate was reported for children age 4 and under (73
   percent). In 1998, NHTSA conducted the National Occupant Protection Use
   Survey (NOPUS). The overall observed shoulder belt use rate was 68.9
   percent, compared to 61.3 percent observed in 1996 and 58.0 percent in
   1994. For more information: Information on occupant protection is
