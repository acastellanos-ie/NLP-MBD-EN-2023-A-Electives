Wireless / Fax Services

   TOPS provides "One Stop" shopping when it comes to Wireless
   communications. All cellular, Paging and Calling Card services are
   procured and provided by TOPS. TOPS is responsible for the acquisition,
   distribution, and maintenance of Cellular phones, Pagers, and Calling
   Cards used by DOT personnel. All of these services are available
   through several sources and can be tailored to meet your organizational
   needs. Our Calling Card service is currently with FTS2000 Network "A"
   (AT&T). This type of Calling Card provides for most, if not all,
   telephone service requirements and eliminates the need for multiple
   Calling Cards. TOPS also offers detailed billing information for all of
   their service offerings.

   TOPS is responsible for the acquisition, distribution, and maintenance
   of facsimile machines used by Department of Transportation (DOT)
   personnel. This includes close coordination with offices requiring use
   of and maintaining an inventory of facsimile machines for replacement.
   This responsibility also includes maintaining contact with vendors for
   repair and replacement. A small stockpile of facsimile machines is
   maintained by TOPS for replacement of down equipment, emergency usage,
   and immediate distribution to satisfy immediate emergency requirements.
   Replacement of facsimile machines is generated under a blanket purchase
   agreement (BPA).

   Offices within DOT that are serviced by TOPS maintain a point of
   contact that is responsible for requesting maintenance on the machines.
   Offices requiring a facsimile machine must forward a memo request to
   the Chief, Telecommunications Operations Division (TOPS), providing
   details of their requirements. Criteria for issuing facsimile machines
   falls under the following guidelines:
     * Office/Job requirement
     * Number of personnel serviced by the facsimile machines.
     * Office level

   Each office is responsible to the Office of Administrative Services and
   Property Management for inventory control of facsimile machines.
   Facsimile machines assigned to a DOT office will be included in that
   offices inventory records maintained by Property Management. Although
   each office is responsible for maintaining control of facsimile
   machines assigned to that office, maintenance of facsimile machines is
   the responsibility of TOPS.
