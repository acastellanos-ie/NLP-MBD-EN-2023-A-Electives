                                EMR Overview

   Electron Magnetic Resonance (EMR) includes conventional Electron Spin
   Resonance (ESR) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR),
   Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR), Antiferromagnetic Resonance (AFMR), and
   Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR). All these spectroscopies share
   common instrumentation and theoretical background.

   The motivation for performing EMR at high frequencies and high magnetic
   fields is based on numerous advantages.
     * Increase in spectral resolution for the measurement of Zeeman
       energies.
     * Accessibility of large zero-field splittings.
     * Increase in sensitivity, technology permitting.
     * High-resolution ENDOR spectroscopy due to high nuclear resonance
       frequencies.
     * Spectroscopy of systems with field-induced transitions.
     * Studies of relaxation effects on very short timescales.

   Within the NHMFL EMR Program, both an in-house science program and a
   user program have been developed with a special focus on several
   versions of EMR spectroscopy. These programs include research in
   physics, chemistry, and biology. For more information please visit the
   home pages of the particular EMR faculty and their groups.
