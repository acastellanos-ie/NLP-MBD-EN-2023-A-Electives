   Year 2000 (Y2K) Information

   This page contains links to the areas of the web site that discuss the
   issues involved, and how the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of
   International Nuclear Safety and Cooperation is participating.

   Time Zones and Soviet-Designed Nuclear Power Plants
   This map shows the different time zones in the former Soviet Union and
   the location of the Soviet-designed nuclear power plants.

   U.S. Experts Helping Soviet-Designed Power Plant Personnel Deal With
   Y2K
   The potential effects of the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer issue present as
   much of a challenge abroad as they do in the United States. Of
   particular concern to U.S. officials is the Y2K preparedness of nuclear
   power plants in the former Soviet Union countries. [more...]

   Soviet-Designed Reactor Safety Activity Report for January, 1999:
   "Looking Ahead...to the Year 2000"
   During the last week of January, the U.S. Department of Energy and the
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) jointly held an international
   workshop to address year 2000 (Y2K) issues relevant to nuclear
   facilities in countries of the former Soviet Union. The seminar, which
   took place at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, focused primarily
   on reviews of operating and safety concerns for NPPs during the
   transition to the next century.[more...]

   Soviet-Designed Reactor Safety Activity Report for December, 1998:
   "Reactor Safety Systems OK in Year 2000 But Expect Unplanned Reactor
   Shutdowns"
   Year-2000 (Y2K) computer glitches may require reworking code and
   replacing systems on many facilities including nuclear power plants
   around the world. However, Y2K problems are not likely to impact
   critical safety systems at Soviet-designed NPPs. That was the bottom
   line of discussions at the first U.S./Russia Y2K Information Exchange
   Workshop held October 13 through 15 in Moscow.[more...]
