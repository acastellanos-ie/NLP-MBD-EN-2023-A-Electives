   CHARLOTTE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER LETTER TO AIRMEN 01-03

   SUBJECT:  Intersection Departures

   CANCELATION:  September 5, 2003

   Air traffic control rules and regulations prohibit the use of taxi into
   position and hold procedures
   at intersections between sunset and sunrise.  Charlotte ATC Tower has a
   waiver allowing the use
   of such procedures at certain intersections and under certain
   conditions.

   Taxi into position and hold procedures may be used on Runway 18L at
   Taxiway A and on
   Runway 36R at Taxiway D2 between sunset and sunrise.  When these
   procedures are in
   effect, the runway shall be used for departure traffic only.

   Charlotte ATC Tower will use these procedures whenever it is
   operationally advantageous to do so.


   Willie R. Moore
   Manager, Charlotte ATC Tower
