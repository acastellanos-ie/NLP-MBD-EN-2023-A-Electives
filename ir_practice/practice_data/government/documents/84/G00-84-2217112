   1.     Purpose. This Chapter describes the Family of Services (FOS) and
   its primary function of providing external users such as value-added
   weather distributors, the academic community, and Federal agencies with
   access to near real-time weather information These services are
   available through a collection of data services which are accessed via
   dedicated telecommunications access lines in the Washington, D.C.,
   area.

   2.     Background. The FOS was established to help fulfill the National
   Weather Service (NWS) mission of making weather information available
   to the private sector. NWS watches, warnings, and advisories are
   disseminated immediately on the NOAA Weather Radio and the NOAA Weather
   Wire Service. These are the primary sources of weather information for
   the media and the general public. NWS watches, warnings, and
   advisories, as well as hydrological, climatological, agricultural, and
   miscellaneous forecasts/products, are then relayed on the NWS FOS as
   appropriate. Other products disseminated over the FOS include
   observations and various aviation, marine, and gridded data.

   3.     Description. The individual FOS data services may be obtained
   from the NWS upon payment of a one-time connection charge and a
   recurring annual user fee. Several private companies subscribe to the
   FOS, then resell the FOS data as received and/or provide value-added
   information services to their customers. The FOS includes the following
   data services:

       a.     Public Product Service (PPS)--carries all public watches;
   warnings; advisories; and various hydrologic, agricultural, and
   miscellaneous forecasts and products;

       b.     Domestic Data Service (DDS)--carries basic observations and
   various aviation, marine, and miscellaneous products;

       c.     International Data Service (IDS)--carries worldwide surface
   and upper air observations and miscellaneous products;

       d.     Numerical Products Service (NPS)--carries global
   model-derived forecasts out to 7 days and weather analyses, most of
   which are in a gridded-binary format;

       e.     High Resolution Data Service (HRS)--carries the same
   products as the NPS, as well as gridded-model data, and serves users
   who have a requirement for error-controlled NPS data. This FOS offering
   is different from the other services in that users connect directly to
   a port in the NWS Telecommunication Gateway computer facility located
   in Silver Spring, Maryland;

       f.     Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS) Graphics
   Service (AGS)--carries centrally produced weather products ("charts")
   in the vector graphic format utilized in the NWS AFOS system;

       g.     Digital Facsimile Service (DIFAX)--carries weather analysis
   and prognosis products related primarily to aviation; and

       h.     Climate Analysis Center Climate Dial-up Service
   (CACCDUS)--provides climate data to users who access a computer data
   base via dial-in access. Unlike the other FOS services, user fees are
   assessed on a usage basis.

   4.     Organizational Responsibility. The Telecommunications and
   Dissemination Branch of the Systems Integration Division, Office of
   Systems Operations, has responsibility for the following:

       a.     overall management of the FOS Telecommunications Program,
   including the circuits and equipment provided by telecommunications
   carriers;

       b.     management of all FOS subscriber agreements;

       c.     establishment and collection of all FOS user fees:

       d.     coordination of all FOS matters with the FOS subscriber
   community; and

       d.     coordination of all FOS matters with the FOS subscriber
   community; and

       e.     management of FOS-related data product catalogs.

   The Operations Plans and Change Management Branch has the
   responsibility for processing FOS Baseline Request for Change items.

   The Central Communications Control Branch of the Systems Operations
   Center is responsible for operating the FOS circuits, including
   real-time technical and operational coordination with FOS users and the
   telecommunications common carriers. The Central Communications Software
   Branch of the Systems Operations Center has the responsibility for
   adding, deleting, or changing products on FOS circuits upon request
   from the FOS Program Leader and for investigating and correcting
   software-related transmission problems.

   The NWS Data Review Group has the responsibility for reviewing FOS Data
   Request for Change items that result in additions, deletions, or
   changes to FOS data requirements.
