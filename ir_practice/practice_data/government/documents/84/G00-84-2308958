             About the California Department of Veterans Affairs

                        "Serving Veterans Since 1946"

   Our Mission

   To confer and administer the benefits provided by a grateful State of
   California to its deserving veterans and their dependents.

   More specifically, to provide California veterans and their families
   with aid and assistance in presenting their claims for veterans'
   benefits under the laws of the United States; to provide them with
   beneficial opportunities through direct low-cost loans to acquire farms
   and homes; and to provide the state's aged or disabled veterans with
   rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a
   home-like environment at the California Veterans Homes.

   This mission is based upon the philosophy that programs of benefits for
   veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public purposes by
   promoting patriotism, by recognizing and rewarding sacrifice and
   service to country, and by providing needed readjustment assistance to
   returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted
   when they responded to their country's call to military service.
