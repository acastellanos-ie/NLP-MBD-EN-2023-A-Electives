                      NASA Office of External Relations

                                   Code I

     The Office of External Relations is a Functional Office that is
     responsible for coordinating major international policies and
     programs with other Federal Agencies (particularly the Department of
     State) and foreign entities. It also serves as the principal NASA
     liaison with the Department of Defense. The Office of External
     Relations provides the functional leadership for international and
     certain interagency relations, including export control and foreign
     visitor policy, and serves as staff to the Administrator.

     Specifically, the Office of External Relations provides agency-wide
     policy guidance on international activities and coordinates
     day-to-day international interaction at the Headquarters corporate
     level in support of all of NASA's Enterprises: Space Science, Earth
     Science, Biological and Physical Research, Human Exploration and
     Development of Space, and Aerospace Technology. This involves such
     activities as formulating, negotiating, and supporting international
     agreements; administering NASA's export control program; and
     providing international and interagency policy recommendations to
     NASA management. The Office of External Relations coordinates
     NASA/DOD agreements and manages NASA participation in the NASA/DOD
     Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board, the NASA/Air Force
     Space Command Partnership Council and the Research and Technology
     Organization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

     To support these varied functions, the Office of External Relations
     is organized into four divisions and one office. A matrix approach
     provides support for country or regional issues. The lead for each
     geographic area is noted on the organization chart. A description of
     each organizational element follows. In addition to its personnel at
     NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, the Office of External
     Relations has representatives based in Australia, Europe, Japan and
     Russia.
