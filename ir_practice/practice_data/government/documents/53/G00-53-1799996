   Health Plans & Benefits
        __________________________________________________________________

   A group health plan is an employee welfare benefit plan established or
   maintained by an employer or by an employee organization (such as a
   union), or both, that provides medical care for participants or their
   dependents directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise.

   Most private sector health plans are covered by the Employee Retirement
   Income Security Act (ERISA). Among other things, ERISA provides
   protections for participants and beneficiaries in employee benefit
   plans (participant rights), including providing access to plan
   information. Also, those individuals who manage plans (and other
   fiduciaries) must meet certain standards of conduct under the fiduciary
   responsibilities specified in the law.

   The Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) of the U.S.
   Department of Labor is responsible for administering and enforcing
   these provisions of ERISA. Click on the agency to find out more about
   the agency's program. As part of carrying out its responsibilities, the
   agency provides consumer information on health plans as well as
   compliance assistance for employers, plan service providers, and others
   to help them comply with ERISA.

   For questions about the tax provisions in the Internal Revenue Code
   relating to health plans, please contact the Internal Revenue Service.

   For questions about the provisions under the Public Health Service Act,
   contact the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the U.S.
   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
