                 Process Control Security Requirements Forum

                       Power Plant High Tension Wires

Welcome

   This site is a resource for users, vendors, and third parties in the
   process control industry who are concerned about information security
   in an increasingly networked world.

   Through the NIST initiative on Critical Infrastructure Protection
   (CIP), we are supporting the development and dissemination of standards
   for process control security. We have established the Process Control
   Security Requirements Forum (PCSRF), a working group comprised of
   vendors and users of process control automation. The PCSRF is applying
   the ISO 15408 Common Criteria methodology to develop Protection
   Profiles for process control.
