                            Neptune's Ring System

   Evidence for incomplete arcs around Neptune first arose in the
   mid-1980's, when stellar occultation experiments were found to
   occasionally show an extra "blink" just before or after the planet
   occulted the star. Images by Voyager 2 in 1989 settled the issue, when
   the ring system was found to contain several faint rings, the outermost
   of which, Adams, contains three prominent arcs now named Liberty,
   Equality and Fraternity. The existence of arcs is very difficult to
   understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread
   out into a uniform ring over very short timescales. The gravitational
   effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring, are now believed
   to confine the arcs. Several other rings were detected by the Voyager
   cameras. In addition to the narrow Adams Ring 63,000 km from the center
   of Neptune, the Leverrier Ring is at 53,000 km and the broader, fainter
   Galle Ring is at 42,000 km. A faint outward extension to the Leverrier
   Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the
   Arago Ring at 57,000 km.

Animations

     Ring Arc Closeup (QuickTime (MOV) format, 1.3 Mbytes).
   This animation zooms in on one of Neptune's ring arcs. The "rope-like"
       structure is caused by smear, since the clumps moved significantly
       while the the camera shutter was open. See the "Twisted Rope" image
       below. Taken from a NASA full motion video and converted to
       QuickTime format.
