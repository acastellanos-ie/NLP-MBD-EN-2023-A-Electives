   USDA, ARS, ERRC is committed to making its web sites accessible to all
        USDA customers and employees. All of the agency web sites are
   undergoing review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet or
     exceed the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of
                                    1973.

     Many of our web sites currently meet the Section 508 accessibility
    standards. Furthermore, USDA, ARS, ERRC  continues to work on making
   all web sites accessible. Thank you very much for your patience through
     this redesign process. If you have any comments or suggestions for
          improvement, please contact the Web Master of this page.
