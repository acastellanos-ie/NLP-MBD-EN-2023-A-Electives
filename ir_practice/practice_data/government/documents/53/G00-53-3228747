       ATTACHED YOU WILL FIND A NUMBER OF LISTS WHICH MAY HELP YOU FIND
   YOUR WAY THROUGH   TYPICAL, DAY-TO-DAY QUESTIONS WHICH YOU MAY HAVE
   REGARDING BANKRUPTCY. FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE FEE FOR
   VARIOUS SERVICES, CLICK HERE - FEES. LIKEWISE, SOMETIMES YOU MAY WANT
   TO KNOW WHO TO ASK FOR WHEN YOU CALL THE CLERK'S OFFICE WITH A
   PARTICULAR QUESTION. IF YOU CLICK HERE - WHO TO ASK FOR - YOU WILL FIND
   OUT THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO PERFORMS PARTICULAR TASKS.

       THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT PENDING
   CASES WITHOUT CALLING THE CLERK'S OFFICE AND ASKING AN EMPLOYEE TO LOOK
   UP THE INFORMATION FOR YOU  (although we remain happy to help you in
   that way and others). THE MOST SOPHISTICATED WAY TO LEARN ABOUT  THE
   ACTUAL DOCUMENTS IN A CASE IS TO ACCESS OUR DOCUMENT IMAGING SYSTEM.
   HOWEVER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE U.S. COURTS HAS NOT YET
   HELPED US SECURE THIS SYSTEM SO IT CANNOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE BAR AND
   PUBLIC AT THIS TIME.    HOWEVER, YOU MAY GET CASE INFORMATION
   ELECTRONICALLY A COUPLE OF OTHER WAYS. YOU CAN  USE YOUR TOUCH TONE
   TELEPHONE AND CALL OUR   V C I S   SYSTEM, OR YOU CAN ACCESS OUR CASE
   DATA BASE BY USING A COMPUTER TO ACCESS OUR   P A C E R   SYSTEM.

   DIRECTIONS FOR USING EITHER VCIS OR PACER.
