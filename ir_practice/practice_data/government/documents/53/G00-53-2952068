   Argonne-West's Engineering Development Laboratory (EDL) provides
   facilities and services for Development and Testing. It is staffed by
   helpful technicians averaging 20 plus years electro/mechanical and
   nuclear experience. Geared toward making jobs easier, the EDL
   encourages and assists project managers, scientists, engineers,
   university professors and students to use the facilities and services.
   Users benefit from a singularly-outstanding working environment with
   safe, high throughput productivity. These same advantages and services
   are available to government organizations and contractors through
   memoranda of understanding/agreement and to private industry through
   Argonne's Industrial Technology Development Center.

   Engineering Development Laboratory technicians team up with Argonne
   staff and other organizations innovating new designs or modifying
   existing equipment for new missions. Process equipment, designed to
   remotely treat Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) fuel for
   disposal, was assembled and tested in one of the EDL's facilities by
   EDL technicians working closely with design engineers. They contributed
   significantly to improving and verifying processes used in the final
   designs for producing and characterizing nuclear fuel waste forms.

   A drying station, developed in the United States, for Russian-built
   BN350 long term spent nuclear fuel storage was assembled and tested in
   the Engineering Development Laboratory before shipment to Kazakhstan.

   The majority of assignments, involving nuclear processes or radioactive
   materials, result from Argonne-West's DoE missions. Engineering
   Development Laboratory technicians have the necessary backgrounds to
   handle hazards associated with these missions and non-nuclear work as
   well.

   Ceramic waste-form container designs, developed with an Australian
   Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), were filled
   with surrogate waste, sealed and hot isostatically pressed in the
   Engineering Development Laboratory.

   The EDL facilities and technicians provide university professors and
   students opportunities to develop new ideas such as the University of
   Idaho's Rapid-Scanning Fourier-Transform Interferometer.

   Mutually beneficial projects are conducted with private enterprise
   developing equipment with broad market potential such as the vapor
   demister for Argonne-West's Sodium Process Facility. Engineering
   Development Laboratory work has resulted in a small number of patents.
   Customers can be assured proprietary information is adequately
   protected.
