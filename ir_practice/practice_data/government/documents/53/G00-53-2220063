   Goo H Haanndd iinn H Haanndd Remember: It takes energy to fight fire.
   Please conserve so that the power will be there if we need it.
   Remember: Wildfires can destroy power lines and stop the flow of
   electricity to entire communities. Don't cause a wildfire. Be Fire
   Safe! If The Power Goes Out: * Traffic lights may go out too. Watch for
   our emergency response vehicles. * Only call 911 if you have a
   life-threatening emergency. * Don't use candles for light unless
   absolutely necessary. If you do use candles, make sure they are in a
   sturdy holder, and never leave them unattended. * Never use propane,
   kerosene or charcoal stoves inside a structure. Their fumes can kill! *
   If you use a generator, NEVER plug it into your whole-house circuit
   without the proper double-poll, double-throw transfer switch. This will
   ensure that power doesn't back-feed into a line and injure workers who
   are trying to repair the line. Be Prepared: ¸ Keep your cell phone
   battery charged. ¸ Keep flashlights and batteries handy. ¸ Keep battery
   powered radios handy. ¸ Put fresh batteries in all smoke alarms. ¸ Know
   how to manually open your garage door and gates in case power goes out.

   Your Power and Be Fire Safe California!
