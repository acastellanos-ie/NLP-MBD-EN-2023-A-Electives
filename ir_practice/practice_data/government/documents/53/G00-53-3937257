  Agenda Information

    Revisions and Updates

   Changes may be made in the agenda, or the meeting may be rescheduled,
   on short notice. The web edition of the agenda is updated whenever
   memorandums are mailed and uploaded to the FTP directory. An Adobe
   Acrobat version of the most recent photocopy agenda is available as
   Agenda.pdf -- but remember that the web edition of the agenda is always
   as current and usually more up-to-date than the hard copy agenda.

   If you plan to attend the meeting, please call 650-494-1335 and you
   will be notified of any late changes -- or send your inquiry by email
   to: meeting@clrc.ca.gov.

   Photocopies of individual items on the agenda are available to people
   who plan to submit written comments or attend the Commission's
   meetings.

   All materials in the FTP Directory are organized by subject. For an
   overview and links to this material, go to the FTP Contents page.

    Email Agendas

   If you would like to subscribe to receive agendas by email, send an
   email message to: agendas@clrc.ca.gov, or fill out one of the Feedback
   Forms -- be sure to check the email agenda box on the form.

   E-agendas are sent whenever a regular Tentative Agenda or Final Agenda
   is prepared for mailing. (The web edition of the agenda is updated
   whenever new meeting materials are uploaded, and so provides the most
   current information.)

  Downloadable Staff Memorandums and Background Studies

   Recent staff meeting memorandums are available for downloading in the
   Commission's FTP directory, as explained in the FTP Contents pages. Or
   you can go straight to the FTP Directory and browse using FTP protocol
   or HTTP protocol. Are you having problems downloading?

   You may also access the FTP directory by Anonymous FTP to:
   ftp.clrc.ca.gov/pub, using "anonymous" as your ID and "guest" as your
   password. Be sure to download in binary or use a web browser that
   automatically detects binary files.

   Letters and other materials included in an exhibit to a memorandum,
   which are not in the Commission's computer system, are usually scanned
   and included in the Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) version of the file. To
   simplify downloading, the constituent files (e.g., memorandum,
   exhibits, and draft statute) are usually combined into one file.

   Only relatively recent and active items are retained on our website. On
   request, we can email a copy or make other arrangements for
   downloading. The staff is also in the process of scanning older
   materials into Acrobat format.

   A catalog of memorandums issued since 1956 is available for online
   browsing.
