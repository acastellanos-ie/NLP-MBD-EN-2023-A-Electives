                                   WELCOME

   The Employment and Training Administration has begun the process of
   developing a strategy for e-government. Success will depend as much on
   collaboration among people, offices and partners as it will on
   resources. The key to success depends on the development of a shared
   vision, and strategy for implementing that vision among ETA and all of
   its state and local partners and stakeholders in America's Workforce
   Network. Towards that end, ETA is committed to a consultive process
   designed to engage our partners and stakeholders fully in the
   development and implementation of a successful e-government strategy.
   This website is part of the effort to continue a dialogue that leads to
   a common vision. Please explore the site, read the documents, and
   provide comments to assist us in our work towards the goal of
   implementing e-government strategies throughout AWN.
