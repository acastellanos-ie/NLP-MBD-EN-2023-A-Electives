   The Geospatial Data Clearinghouse is a collection of over 250 spatial
       data servers,
       that have digital geographic data primarily for use in Geographic
       Information Systems
       (GIS), image processing systems, and other modelling software.
       These data collections
       can be searched through a single interface based on their
       descriptions, or "metadata."
       Click on the name of a Clearinghouse Gateway
       on the map below that is closest
       to you and you will be presented with a selection of query forms.
       All entry points or
       gateways shown have exactly the same lists of servers.
