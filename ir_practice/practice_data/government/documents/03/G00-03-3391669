   The National Peanut Research Laboratory mission is to conduct basic and
   applied research to develop knowledge of the factors affecting the
   production, harvesting, storage, quality, and safety of peanuts. The
   U.S. peanut industry is in a period of economic and technological
   change and research at NPRL is dedicated to maintaining and improving
   the competitiveness and quality of U.S. peanuts domestically and
   internationally.

   Specifically, research is being conducted to:
   (1) develop peanut management systems to enhance profitability,
   competitiveness, and quality of peanuts; (2) ensure peanut safety by
   developing technology for detection and control of mycotoxin
   (aflatoxin) contamination; (3) develop best management practices for
   subsurface drip irrigation to enhance profitability and foster
   environmental stewardship; (4) develop equipment and technology for
   cleaning, handling, curing, and storing to improve peanut market
   quality and minimize costs; (5) improve industry efficiency and develop
   a system for accurately estimating the impacts of new technologies on
   the competitiveness of U.S. peanuts.
