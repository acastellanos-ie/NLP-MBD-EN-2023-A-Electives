   Arrow Landsat 5 to Continue Operations
   The USGS announced that Landsat 5 will continue to collect data. See
   Article.
   Arrow Low cost samples available
   Three LANDSAT 7 data products are offered.  A Level 0R product costs
   $475, while the Level 1R and Level 1G products cost $600.  There are NO
   restrictions on the use, reprocessing or redistribution of LANDSAT 7
   data purchased from the US Government. In order to improve awareness of
   the quality of the LANDSAT 7 data, we also offer low cost($32+$5S&H)
   sample data products.
   Arrow LANDSAT Data Continuity Mission
   The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 directs LANDSAT Program
   Management (NASA and the USGS) to assess options for a data system to
   succeed the orbiting LANDSAT 7. The ldcm.usgs.gov is an open forum site
   on the LANDSAT Data Continuation Mission. The site contains LANDSAT 7
   images, listings of documents for a public review and comment,
   reference documents, announcements of upcoming workshops, and a way to
   send feedback to the LDCM management. It is a resource for the general
   public, NASA, USGS, and contractors working on, or interested in, the
   LANDSAT Data Continuation Mission.  Read more...
   Arrow Monitoring the Data...
   A unique feature of the LANDSAT system is the image analysis system
   (IAS). The IAS routinely samples incoming data to monitor the health of
   the instrument and capture any image anomalies. One of the recurring
   anomalies LANDSAT 7 sees, occurs when the scanning mirror and
   associated scanning mechanisms lose the synchronization between
   themselves causing visible artifacts to appear in the images being
   taken during event. Read More...
   Arrow Two ways to get LANDSAT 7 data.
   There are two systems that support searching and ordering products from
   the US LANDSAT 7 archive. The Earth Data Gateway (EDG) was developed by
   the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) program. EDG supports searches
   from multiple EOS data sources across multiple Data Active Archive
   Centers (DAAC). These data sources include LANDSAT 7, MODIS and ASTER.
   The EarthExplorer was developed by the USGS to replace the current
   Global Land Information System (GLIS). EarthExplorer allows searches
   across multiple USGS maintained data sets. These data sets include
   LANDSAT 7, LANDSAT 1 -5, AVHRR and aerial photography. The two systems
   produce similar LANDSAT 7 Level 1 products. Click here to read a report
   on the product differences.
   LANDSAT 7 Partners, NASA and USGS
   The LANDSAT 7 is a joint venture between the US NASA Logo Geological
   Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
   (NASA).
   Arrow USGS Business Partners
   To promote distribution of its products, the USGS has, for many years,
   operated a network of Business Partners, or data dealers. Recently,
   this network has been expanded to include a number of private business
   that handle LANDSAT 7 data products. The Business Partners, in some
   cases, turn around data products without alteration. Many times,
   however, they add value to the products by reformatting, changing
   media, combining them with other data, or performing analysis. Their
   variety of product offerings, as well as delivery times, may be more
   attractive than those of the USGS. You may view a list of Business
   Partners for satellite data here. If you are interested in becoming a
   Business Partner, please look  here.
