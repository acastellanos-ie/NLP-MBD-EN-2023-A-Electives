   Welcome to the home page of the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of
   Inspector General. Our mission is to help the Department and the
   American taxpayer by:
     * Identifying opportunities for cost savings and operational
       efficiencies in Department programs; and
     * Returning hard dollars to the Department and the U.S. Treasury as a
       result of Office of Inspector General civil and criminal
       investigations.

   In Our Service We Have:
     * Assisted the Department, including the National Nuclear Security
       Administration, in identifying key management challenges such as
       the aging of the nuclear weapons complex infrastructure and the
       emerging human capital crisis;
     * Facilitated efforts to reform Department security, by identifying
       both systemic and situational vulnerabilities;
     * Annually audited the agency's financial statements, helping to
       ensure that the Department does that which every American business
       must do: balance its books;
     * Highlighted opportunities for reductions in overhead costs in
       environmental management and defense programs;
     * Investigated and helped bring to justice those who have committed
       crimes against the Department, with recent special emphasis on
       cyber crimes at an agency which owns and operates some of the most
       sophisticated supercomputers in the world; and
     * Issued a host of reports identifying concrete opportunities to
       reform Department: contract management; waste management;
       environment, safety and health stewardship; research and
       development; major facilities and project construction and
       operation; and human capital.
