Welcome To Structure 2 Function Project Homepage

     Many of the gene products of completely sequenced organisms are
     'hypothetical' - they cannot be related to any previously
     characterized proteins - and so are of completely unknown function.

     Structural studies provide one means of obtaining functional
     information in these cases. A 'structural genomics' project has been
     initiated aimed at determining the structures of hypothetical
     proteins from Haemophilus influenzae to gain an understanding of
     their function.

     This project is a collaboration between theCenter for Advanced
     Research in Biotechnology and TIGR Institute For Genomic Research .
