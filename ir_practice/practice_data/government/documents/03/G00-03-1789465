                        TROPOSPHERIC AEROSOL PROGRAM

   Welcome to the TAP Home Page!
   The Tropospheric Aerosol Program (TAP) is a major new research program
   to examine the processes that govern the loading, composition, and
   microphysical properties of tropospheric aerosols. The program is under
   development for the Environmental Sciences Division of the U.S.
   Department of Energy (DOE).

   TAP Program Plan. The TAP Program Plan (March, 2001) presents an
   overview of the research to be conducted in TAP. This plan is a natural
   outgrowth of reviews, assessments, and workshops undertaken over the
   past few years by the National Research Council; the Air Quality
   Research Subcommittee of the Committee on Environment and Natural
   Resources, National Science and Technology Council; and NARSTO
   (formerly the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone,
   now with an expanded scope that includes aerosols), a public/private
   partnership, whose membership spans government, the utilities,
   industry, and university researchers in Mexico, the United States, and
   Canada. The Program Plan is available as a PDF [pdficon.gif] file (1.5
   Mbyte).

   This plan was prepared at the initiative of the DOE Office of
   Biological and Environmental Research (OBER) (within the DOE Office of
   Science) in response to these crucial national and energy-related
   needs. These efforts were also encouraged by and coordinated with
   colleagues in the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and the DOE Office of
   Fossil Energy. The formulation of TAP has been greatly aided by
   colleagues in EPA, NOAA, NASA, and the NSF, other offices of DOE,
   industry, and academia.

   After a draft version of this document had been circulated, a workshop
   was held at Brookhaven National Laboratory in June, 1999, to gain input
   from a broad community representing scientists from DOE National
   Laboratories, other Federal laboratories, academia, and the private
   sector, and officials in the various Federal agencies responsible for
   air quality and aerosol research. That document was circulated to
   Workshop participants and to other scientists and officials in the
   several cognizant Federal agencies and was made available on the World
   Wide Web. The TAP Program Plan is a refinement of that document that
   takes into account comments and suggestions on the Preliminary Program
   Plan. The Program Plan is an attempt to capture the wisdom and
   contributions of the many people who have participated in the planning
   of TAP, while maintaining a balanced and focused program.

   As may be seen in the document, there is considerable need for the
   "atmospheric processes" component of a national aerosol research
   program that is described. The research is driven primarily by health
   effects but also to some extent by visibility and climate change
   considerations. There is also considerable interest from the energy
   production and consumption industries as much of the aerosol is energy
   related.

   There is a considerable potential challenge to industry in helping to
   meet the recent National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for fine
   particles. Thus there is an almost unprecedented opportunity for
   collaborative work in TAP with other offices of DOE, other Federal
   Agencies, industry, and academia.

   The proposed DOE TAP program is viewed as very much a part of an
   emerging national aerosol research program, coordinated by the federal
   Air Quality Research Subcommittee and implemented in collaboration with
   NARSTO.

   A description of TAP was presented at the Fall 1999 AGU meeting. The
   viewgraphs of that presentation are available as a PDF [pdficon.gif]

   An update on the status of TAP was presented at the 2001 Annual Meeting
   of the DOE Atmospheric Sciences Program, Raleigh, NC, February 13-15,
   2001. The viewgraphs of that presentation are available as a PDF
