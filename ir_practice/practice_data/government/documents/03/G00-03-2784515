                                 ABOUT THE CONFERENCE
            This is the Fourteenth Symposium in a well established series
            of conferences held roughly every three years since 1959. The
              Symposium is concerned with theoretical, experimental, and
              applied aspects of the thermophysical properties of gases,
                                 liquids and solids.
               The Fourteenth Symposium will feature approximately 140
              sessions with more than 600 papers, with invited papers on
                            many topics of high interest.
            The areas of thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids
            and solids are broadly represented. Special topics covered in
            the Fourteenth Symposium are: acoustic, optical, photothermal
                 and subsecond techniques of measuring thermophysical
            properties; materials of strong technological interest, namely
               molten materials, natural gas, thin films, refrigerants,
             polymer solutions, and supercritical fluids; properties for
            chemical and metallurgical process design; fundamental topics
               such as molecular simulation of fluid behavior, critical
            behavior, properties in low gravity, shear effects on property
            measurement, structure of fluids, wetting and interfaces; and
                property data, including demonstrations of databases.
              The Fourteenth Symposium features the presentation of the
            Yeram S. Touloukian Award of the ASME Heat Transfer Division.
                                    FINAL PROGRAM
             The final program of the Symposium will be available at the
                            time of on-site registration.
                                     PROCEEDINGS
                Papers submitted for publication are due May 1, 2000.
            Instructions for manuscript preparation have been distributed
               to contributors of abstracts and are available from the
            Symposium Assistant at NIST. All papers will be reviewed. The
            accepted papers will be published in the International Journal
               of Thermophysics, Fluid Phase Equilibria, or Journal of
             Chemical and Engineering Data. Organizations and individuals
            that currently subscribe to these journals will automatically
            receive the extra volumes. Others can make arrangements during
             the symposium for purchase of the special volumes containing
                                the conference papers.
                                   PREPRINT VOLUME
             A preprint volume on CD-ROM of the papers submitted for the
             Symposium by the deadline of May 1, 2000 will be distributed
                    to the attendees at the time of registration.
