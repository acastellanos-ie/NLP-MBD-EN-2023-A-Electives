   Welcome to the Landscape Architects Technical Committee web site.

   The Landscape Architects Technical Committee, under the purview of the
   California Architects Board, was created by the California Legislature
   to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public by establishing
   standards of licensure and the enforcing of laws and regulations which
   govern the profession of landscape architecture.  It is one of the
   numerous boards, bureaus, commissions, and committees within the
   Department of Consumer Affairs responsible for consumer protection and
   the regulation of licensed professions.
