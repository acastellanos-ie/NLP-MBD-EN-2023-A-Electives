   English Sole eggs The Northwest Fisheries Science Center is one of five
   research centers of NOAA Fisheries (the National Marine Fisheries
   Service), and is responsible for providing scientific and technical
   support for the management, conservation, and development of the
   Pacific Northwest region's anadromous and marine fishery resources. Its
   multidisciplinary research--involving fisheries science, marine biology
   and ecology, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, oceanography,
   and aquaculture--is conducted in cooperation with other agencies
   (federal, state, local, and tribal), universities throughout the world,
   Pacific Rim and European countries, and in support of international
   treaties.
