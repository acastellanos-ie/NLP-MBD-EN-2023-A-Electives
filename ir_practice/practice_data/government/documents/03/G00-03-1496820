   NOS Publishes Environmental Sensitivity Atlas for New Jersey to Rhode
   Island Coastline

   NOAA's Ocean Service has published an environmental sensitivity index
   atlas for the coastline from New Jersey to Rhode Island. Environmental
   sensitivity index (ESI) atlas maps serve as quick references to
   identify vulnerable coastal locations for oil and chemical spill
   responders and coastal zone managers. They contain three kinds of
   information: (1) shorelines are color-coded to indicate their
   sensitivity to oiling; (2) sensitive biological resources, such as
   seabird colonies and marine mammal haulout grounds, are depicted as
   symbols on the maps, and (3) show sensitive human-use resources, such
   as water intakes, marinas, and swimming beaches are also identified.
   NOAA has created atlases for most coastal areas in the United States,
   including Alaska, Hawaii, the Great Lakes, and the Trust Territories.
