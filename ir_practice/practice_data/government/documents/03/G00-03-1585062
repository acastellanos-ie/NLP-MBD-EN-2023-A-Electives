   The U.S. Geological Survey is the Nation's largest earth-science agency
   and has the principal responsibility within the Federal Government for
   providing hydrologic information and for appraising the Nation's water
   resources.
   The water resources of Indiana consist of numerous streams, rivers,
   lakes, and aquifer systems. The Indiana District staff measures
   streamflow and ground-water levels as well as collects water-quality
   data throughout the State. These hydrologic data along with
   stream-sediment characteristics and water-use data are used in research
   and studies to describe the quantity, quality, and location of
   Indiana's water resources. Collection, analysis, and interpretation of
   these data are done in cooperation with other federal, State, and local
   agencies, universities, and research centers.
