   Function

   The Cryogenic Technologies Group of NIST conducts research in
   cryogenics to assist industry and other government agencies in the
   development of new and/or improved processes and products involving
   cryogenic technologies.

   Major Program Elements
     * Develop advanced measurement techniques and standard measurements
       practices for cryogenic processes.
     * Investigate new and innovative cryogenic refrigeration processes.
     * Develop mathematical models for cryogenic processes.
     * Design and test prototype components and systems to compare
       performance with models to improve modeling techniques.
     * Provide critically evaluated data for the properties of solid
       materials at cryogenic temperature.
     * Assist in development of a bibliographic database on cryogenics.
     * Conduct calibrations of cryogenic flowmeter.
