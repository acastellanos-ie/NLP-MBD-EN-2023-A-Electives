      LCLUC is an interdisciplinary scientific theme within NASA’s Earth
      Science Enterprise (ESE).

      LCLUC Goals:
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   To develop the capability to perform repeated global
      inventories of land-use and land-cover from space,
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   To develop the scientific understanding and models
      necessary to simulate the processes taking place
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   Evaluate the consequences of observed and predicted
      changes
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   Further the understanding of the consequences of
      land-use and land-cover changes on environmental goods and services,
      the carbon and water cycles and the management of natural resources
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   To improve understanding of human interaction with
      the environment, and thus provide a scientific foundation for
      sustainability, vulnerability and resilience of land systems and their
      use.

      LCLUC Key Science Questions:
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   Where are land cover and land use changing, what is
      the extent and over what time scale?
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   What are the causes and what are the consequences of
      LCLUC?
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   What are the projected changes of LCLUC and their
      potential impacts?
      [Grn_Bullet.GIF]   What are the impacts of climate variability and
      changes on LCLUC and what is the potential feedback?
