   This Web site is devoted to information about the Millennium Edition of
   the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). The MUTCD
   contains standards for traffic control devices that regulate, warn, and
   guide road users along the highways and byways in all 50 States.
   Traffic control devices are important because they optimize traffic
   performance, promote uniformity nationwide, and help improve safety by
   reducing the number and severity of traffic crashes.
     * The electronic version posted on the MUTCD website December 18,
       2000 is the official FHWA publication. FHWA is not printing copies
       of the millennium MUTCD because of the prohibitive costs involved.
       The website version is also more efficient and reliable when
       revising the MUTCD.
     * The effective date of the Federal Register final rule for the 2000
       MUTCD is January 17, 2001. States have 2 years to adopt the MUTCD
       changes. The adoption date is January 17, 2003.
     * National organizations (ATSSA, ITE, AASHTO) have partnered and
       printed hard copies of the millennium MUTCD with the editorial
       corrections incorporated. These hard copies are now available for
       sale.
     * A Federal Register Errata Notice was publishing in July 26. We
       published a list of the editorial corrections on the MUTCD website
       with the corrections incorporated into the electronic text.
     * A PowerPoint side-by-side comparison of the old and new editions is
       now available! Click here
