   Notice:

   The former Physics Directorate has merged with elements of the Laser
   Programs Directorate to form the Physics and Advanced Technologies
   Directorate. Established in July 2000, this new directorate will
   execute and support programs that apply cutting edge physics and
   advanced technologies to develop integrated solutions to problems in
   national security, fusion energy, information systems, health care, and
   other national grand challenges.
