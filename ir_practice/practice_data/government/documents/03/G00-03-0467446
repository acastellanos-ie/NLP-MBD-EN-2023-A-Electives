      [Pegasus Wing Glove Experiment] Researchers in Code ASM developed
   instrumented ceramic tiles for use on the successful Pegasus Wing Glove
                                 Experiment.

      Our Focus
      Transatmospheric vehicles and planetary entry spacecraft are comprised
      of four major systems: 1) avionics, 2) propulsion, 3) structure, and 4)
      thermal protection. The Thermal Protection Materials & Systems Branch
      (Code ASM) at Ames is a unique NASA organization for pursuing research,
      technology development and program support for this critical vehicle
      system.

      In The News
      Sept. 28, 2000 -- The SHARP program completes a second successful
      flight test.

                    Some Highlights of Code ASM Research
       (A list of all projects in Code ASM can be found in the Current
                             Research section.)

   [TPSX Logo]

   Thermal Protection System Expert & Material Properties Database
   Code ASM has created a PC-based material properties database called
   "TPSX: Thermal Protection Systems Expert and Material Properties
   Database". It contains information about the thermal protection
   materials developed and/or used in the ASM branch. TPSX Version 1.1 can
   be downloaded from this site.
   [SHARP LOGO] SHARP (Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic Research
   Probes)
   NASA Ames, in conjunction with small companies, has been developing new
   Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs). We believe the UHTCs will
   enable sharp leading edges for space vehicles. We have successfully
   tested these materials in the ground-based arc jet facilities, and the
   first flight demonstration in May 1997 was a success. We are working
   with Sandia National Laboratory and the U.S. Air Force to integrate a
   UHTC nosetip onto a reentry vehicle. See a more detailed discussion of
   high-temperature TPS design and optimization.
   [Pegasus Patch]

   Pegasus Wing Glove Experiment
   The most recent Orbital Sciences Pegasus Mission to deliver a Brazilian
   Satellite to earth orbit and to fly a NASA Hypersonics experiment was a
   huge success. A major contribution to the glove assembly were the Ames
   instrumented TUFI-20 tiles, which surround the metallic portion of the
   glove.
   Also visit the Orbital Sciences and NASA Dryden sites for more
   information.

   Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology (RLV) Program
   The RLV Program is a partnership among NASA, the Air Force, and
   industry for world leadership in low-cost space transportation. The
   objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate new
   technologies for the next generation of reusable space transportation
   systems that can radically reduce the cost of access to space. The
   experimental flight (X vehicles) portion of the program includes the
   X-33 and X-34 projects.
   [Stardust Logo]

   Stardust Program
   We are Stardust... the space mission that will fly close to a comet
   and, for the first time ever, bring cometary material back to Earth for
   analysis by scientists worldwide. STARDUST has been selected by NASA as
   a candidate mission for the Discovery Program of highly focused deep
   space missions with exceptional science return at lowest possible cost.
