     Physics and Advanced Technologies was established in July 2000
   through the merger of the former Physics Directorate and elements of
   the former Laser Programs. The directorate will execute and support
   programs that apply cutting edge physics and advanced technologies to
   develop integrated solutions to problems in national security, fusion
   energy, information systems, health care, and other national grand
   challenges.

   Core capabilities of Physics and Advanced Technologies include:
     * High-energy density experimental and computational physics
     * Plasma physics
     * Nuclear and elementary particle physics
     * Medical physics and technology
     * Optics and imaging
     * Photonics
     * Solid-state physics
     * Materials science and micro-technology
     * Advanced sensing, communication, and information processing
     * Accelerator and beam physics theory and technology

   The P.A.T. directorate has a budget of approximately $140M and a staff
   of about 400 employees. Physics and Advanced Technologies is highly
   integrated, multidisciplinary, and has substantive research ties to the
   rest of the Laboratory, and to universities and industry.
