   Welcome to the VLSI Systems Design Group, part of Lawrence Berkeley
   Laboratory's Engineering Division. We are a diverse staff of
   scientists, engineers and technicians with skills spanning all areas of
   integrated-circuit-based systems design. We deliver custom-crafted
   solutions for large scale instrumentation and data processing problems
   to an international community of scientists and engineers. Our core
   strengths include the design of mixed analog and digital integrated
   electronics under unusual and difficult electronic noise, bandwidth,
   data rates, packaging density, power and cooling constraints. Inquiries
   may be directed to Stuart Kleinfelder, group leader, at 510-486-7167,
   SAKleinfelder@lbl.gov, or Oren Milgrome, deputy group leader, at
   510-486-5687, OBMilgrome@lbl.gov.

   Some of our strengths and directions include:
     * Massively parallel detector instrumentation for high energy
       physics, nuclear science and astrophysics.
     * Medical imaging instrumentation.
     * X-ray crystallography instrumentation.
     * High speed and dynamic range analog transient recorder technology.
     * Design and test of radiation hardened electronics.

   People and facilities include:
     * Engineering professionals spanning every area of VLSI-based systems
       design.
     * Industry standard Cadence, Mentor and public domain computer aided
       design tools.
     * Well equipped laboratories for research, development and automated
       production testing.

   Current projects include:
     * Available soon.
