   NASA's SIMBIOS Program consists of the SIMBIOS Science Team and the
   SIMBIOS Project Office. The SIMBIOS Science Team,  as initially defined
   by the NRA selections, was expanded to include additional
   investigations for atmospheric correction algorithm validation. The
   SIMBIOS program is substantially augmented by the participation of the
   NASA-supported MODIS Oceans Team and SeaWiFS Calibration and Validation
   program. SIMBIOS collaborators associated with other relevant programs
   and science teams who contribute data, algorithms, etc., are given
   access to SIMBIOS Project resources in return, e.g., access to the
   SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS). Besides
   providing administrative and contract support for the science team, the
   SIMBIOS Project Office is scoped to support four primary activities:
   data product validation, sensor calibration, data merger algorithm
   evaluation, and satellite data processing.

   A full overview of the SIMBIOS PROGRAM can be obtained by visiting the
