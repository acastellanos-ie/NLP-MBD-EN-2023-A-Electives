   OUR MISSION
   CCS conducts basic and applied research in key areas of computer and
   computational science.

   We develop novel computer-science solutions in both hardware and
   software as well as multidisciplinary computational techniques that
   support the Laboratory's core scientific competencies.

   Wu Feng and Radiant
   Research at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in high-performance
   networking addresses the communication needs of Grand challenge
   applications over a wide range of environments  wide-area network
   (WAN) in support of grids and local-area network (LAN) and system-area
   network (SAN) in support of network of workstations and clusters.
