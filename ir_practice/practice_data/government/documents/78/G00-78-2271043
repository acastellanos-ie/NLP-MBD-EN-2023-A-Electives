     Agriculture in Brazil and Argentina: Developments and Prospects for
                              Major Field Crops

         By Randall D. Schnepf, Erik Dohlman, and Christine Bolling

      ERS Agriculture and Trade Report No. WRS013. 85 pp, December 2001

       This report identifies key factors underlying the agricultural
      productivity growth and enhanced international competitiveness of
    Brazil and Argentina in the past decade. Economic and policy reforms,
     infrastructure development, and enhanced use of agricultural inputs
    that drove output growth during the 1990s are discussed. This report
    also compares Brazilian, Argentine, and U.S. soybean production costs
       and evaluates the combined impact of production, marketing, and
     transportation costs on the overall export competitiveness of each
   country's soybean producers. Finally, the outlook for continued growth
            in output and exports of key commodities is assessed.

      Keywords: brazil, argentina, soybeans, corn, wheat, agriculture,
                  policy, infrastructure, production costs
