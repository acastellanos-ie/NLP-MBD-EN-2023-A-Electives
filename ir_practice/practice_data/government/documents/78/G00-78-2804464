   Filtering MODIS Ocean Data Using Quality Level Flags



Overview

   The three basic types of MODIS ocean data products are ocean color, sea
   surface temperature, and ocean primary production. Ocean color and sea
   surface temperature are available at processing level 2 and 3, whereas
   ocean primary production is available at processing level 4. There are
   a variety of time-binned and space-binned averages. All data may be
   obtained from the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center



Level 2 Products


   Each Level 2 "granule" represents 5 minutes of Terra viewing. The ocean
   color products are only collected during the day, resulting in 144
   granules per day. The sea surface temperature products are collected
   both day and night, resulting in 288 granules per day. Pixels have 1 km
   spatial resolution. There are 1354 pixels across the granule, and 2030
   pixels down the granule. Thirty-six ocean color parameters and four sea
   surface temperature parameters are available.

   There are also thirty-five quality control (QC) parameters which are
   inputs to the ocean algorithms and atmospheric correction (e.g.,
   meteorological data, radiance data, brightness temperatures). The QC
   files also contain latitude and longitude for each pixel.

   Data files:
     * Ocean Color Water-leaving Radiance Products (Parameters 1-12)
     * Ocean Color Derived Products Group 1 (Parameters 13-25)
     * Ocean Color Derived Products Group 2 (Parameters 26-36)
     * Ocean Color Quality Control Products (Parameters 51-68)
     * Sea Surface Temperature Products (4 Parameters)
     * Sea Surface Temperature Quality Control Products (Parameters 41-50,
       69-78)

Level 3 Binned Products

   Level 3 binned products are global products. Spatial bins have 4.63 km
   spatial resolution in an integerized sinusoidal equal area grid. Only
   bins with data values are present; land bins and bins with no data are
   not in the files. Time averaging varies with product. All 36 ocean
   color parameters and 4 sea surface temperature parameters are
   available. Each Level 3 binned file contains all quality flags
   appropriate for that parameter (quality level, common flags,
   product-specific flags).

   These products are called QC'd because the binning process ensures that
   pixels of varying quality are never mixed within a bin. In other words,
   a single bin will only contain pixels of like quality, but different
   bins may be of different quality.

   During space binning or time binning, pixels are placed in a given bin
   according to the quality level of the pixels. There are four possible
   quality levels for a pixel: quality level 0 = good, level 1 =
   questionable, level 2 = cloudy, level 3 = bad other than cloud. For any
   given bin only the highest quality level available is summed. That is
   to say that different pixel quality levels are never mixed within a
   bin. This is best illustrated with an example. Suppose three pixels
   could be assigned to bin N; two of these pixels have a quality of 1,
   and the remaining pixel has a (higher) quality level 0. In this case,
   only the pixel with quality 0 is binned and the two quality 1 pixels
   are not considered. That is, the binning procedure considers only the
   "best" data available for a given bin. Currently the final maps will
   contain "all" bins. While quality levels are never mixed within a bin,
   adjacent bins may have a different quality level ranging from good to
   bad.

   While most large clouds are removed in the binning process, some
   regions of the globe are persistently cloud contaminated or routinely
   produce poor quality data. As a result, bins of poor or questionable
   quality will be present in the global files in localized regions. Users
   of the data should evaluate the bin quality level and filter the image
   for their specific application. Further information on the binning
   algorithm can be found in the SeaWifs technical report: Campbell, J.,
   J.M. Blaisdell, and M. Darzi, 1995, Spatial and Temporal Binning
   Algorithms, NASA Technical Memorandum 104566, Vol 32, Appendix A, pp.
   63-65.

Level 3 Mapped Products

   The map products are global products as well. Bins for the entire globe
   are present in the data files, including fill values for land bins and
   bins with missing data. Spatial resolution varies per product: 4.63 km,
   36 km, or 1 degree. Time averaging varies with product as well. All 36
   ocean color parameters and 4 sea surface temperature parameters are
   available. Maps are in a cylindrical equidistant map projection. The
   Level 3 mapped data is also QC'd.

Level 3 Interim Daily QC Products

   Level 3 Interim Daily QC products are daily global composites of the
   quality control (QC) parameters. These data are the inputs to the ocean
   algorithms and atmospheric correction (e.g., meteorological data,
   radiance data, brightness temperatures). There are 20 sea surface
   temperature QC parameters (10 daytime and 10 nighttime), and 15 ocean
   color QC parameters. Two of the 15 ocean color QC parameters are
   latitude and longitude of each bin. Spatial bins have 4.63 km spatial
   resolution. Both binned files and mean maps are available.
