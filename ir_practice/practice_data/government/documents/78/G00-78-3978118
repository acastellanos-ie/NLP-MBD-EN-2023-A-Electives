   The Antitrust Section helps protect the free enterprise system by
   detecting antitrust and anticompetitive practices and taking legal
   action to stop them. Acting as a watchdog to maintain a free and open
   marketplace, this section also works with the Legislature, government
   agencies and, where appropriate, businesses, to eliminate laws and
   regulations that put anti-competitive restraints on the free enterprise
   system. As an example, the Antitrust Section was instrumental in
   opening Pennsylvania to competition in the telephone, electric and
   other utility industries. The Antitrust Section also has an educational
   function, making attorneys available for lectures and public programs
   about antitrust issues throughout the state. The offices of the Section
   are located in Harrisburg.
