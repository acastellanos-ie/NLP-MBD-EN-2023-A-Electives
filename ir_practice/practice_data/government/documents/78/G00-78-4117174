   and freedom over the forces of hatred and tyranny.

   ·        According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than
   three million World War II veterans have died since Congress first
   authorized the Memorial in 1993.

   ·        It has been nearly six years since Congress authorized a World

   Affairs Health Resources Access Improvement Act of 2001, would expedite
   VA-DoD sharing of medical resources, improving the health care of both
   military personnel and veterans. (Bill | Summary)

   ·        Currently, military health care facilities and veterans
   medical treatment centers often treat the same patients, yet there is
   virtually no cooperation and coordination of care.  This leads to
   unnecessary red tape for patients who utilize both facilities.

   ·        The General Accounting Office (GAO) reports that American
   taxpayers could save as much as $300 million a year in pharmaceutical
   procurement alone with greater coordination between the two agencies.

   ·        The bill would establish an integrated demonstration project
   at five locations where both VA and DoD have health care facilities in

   demonstration program at a minimum of six penal and other long-term
   institutions to determine the costs and advantages of providing
   counseling on health care, benefits and job placement to veterans soon
   to be discharged from long-term institutional care.

   ·        Encourages the Secretaries of HUD and the VA to work together
   in assuring that recipients of funds from any government program are
   aware of the need to serve the large number of homeless veterans, and
   to jointly devise a method to track veterans who participated in
   homeless programs.

   ·        Signed into law by President Bush December 21, 2001 as Public
   Law 107-95.

   Expanded Access to Health Care for Veterans.

   ·        H.R. 2792, the Disabled Veterans Service Dog and Health Care
   Improvement Act of 2001 would introduce innovative solutions to the
   specific health care needs of an aging veterans population.  (Bill |
   Summary)

   to assist the veteran with various activities of daily living.  The new
   benefit would also include travel reimbursement for the costs incurred
   in training the service dog.

   (VISN) to maintain a proportional share of national capacity in VAs
   specialized medical care programs.

   ·        Establish a four-year, four-VISN pilot program of applied
   managed care through an outside contractor in VAs $500 million
   fee-basis and contract hospitalization program.  The program would
   accommodate those service-connected veterans who:

   Þ    Live too far away from a VA medical center.

   Þ    Suffer from health conditions which an available VA hospital
   cannot treat.

   Þ    Find themselves in health- or life-threatening emergencies when no
   VA medical facility is reasonably available.

   ·        Passed the House on October 23, 2001; pending in the Senate.

   ·        Major provisions of bill incorporated on December 11, 2001;
   see H.R. 3447.

   Protection of VA Education Benefits for Reservists.

   ·        H.R. 3240, the Reservists Education Protection Act, protects
   educational benefits for servicemembers called to active duty,
   reassigned or relocated in the war on terrorism. (Bill | Summary)

   ·        Extends, for a member of a reserve component who was called to
   active duty, the period during which the Reservist may use his or her
   VA educational benefits by the length of active service plus four
   months.
