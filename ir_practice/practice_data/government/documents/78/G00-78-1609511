Introduction

   The Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) is an instrument aboard the
   ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). It is designed to
   obtain spectra-spectroheliograms in a number of lines simultaneously in
   the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

   Resources available from this server can be broken up into the
   following main categories:

  Scientific and Technical Information

     * A good description of the CDS instrument can be found in the CDS
       Scientific Report ("Blue Book").
     * The following diagram shows the CDS optical layout. Shown are both
       the normal and grazing incidence spectrometers, which are both fed
       by different angular segments of a Wolter Type II grazing incidence
       telescope.
     * CDS-related publications.
     * CDS science studies which are available to be used on the flight
       instrument.
     * The CDS Operations Diary contains information about the technical
       aspects of the CDS daily operations.

  Contact information

     * List of institutions contributing to CDS.
     * CDS Email and phone directory.

  Software

     * We maintain a CDS software mailing list that you can subscribe to.
     * Information about installing the CDS software.
     * Guide for the CDS scientist.
     * CDS software notes
     * CDS required science analysis software
     * CDS software written in IDL.
     * One line summaries of all CDS routines.
     * Search the CDS software library.
     * Notes on software sharing
     * Central to the science analysis software is the Atomic Data and
       Analysis Structure (ADAS)
     * Another important atomic database and software package is CHIANTI
       which is available from both a site in the United States and in
       Europe

  Data

     * Search the CDS catalog of observations.
     * We now maintain a CDS data analysis discussion mailing list that
       you can subscribe to.
