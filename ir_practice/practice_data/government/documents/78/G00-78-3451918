Mission

   The mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences
   (NIGMS) is to support basic biomedical research that is not targeted to
   specific diseases. NIGMS funds studies on genes, proteins, and cells,
   as well as on fundamental processes like communication within and
   between cells, how our bodies use energy, and how we respond to
   medicines. The results of this research increase our understanding of
   life and lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis,
   treatment, and prevention. NIGMS attempts to ensure the vitality and
   continued productivity of basic biomedical research, while producing
   the next generation of scientific breakthroughs and training the next
   generation of scientists.
   __________________________________________________________________

Goals

Research

     * To support high-quality basic research that will lead to the
       medical and industrial advances of the future and that will provide
       the basis for further progress in understanding the fundamental
       behavior of biological systems. The primary approach is through the
       support of peer-reviewed, investigator-initiated research
       applications.
     * To provide opportunities for long-term and/or high-risk research,
       when the possible impact of a successful outcome warrants the
       investment. This requires some measure of stability for the
       individual investigator, consistent with the need to maintain high
       quality. It also requires the stimulation and encouragement of
       emerging areas of science that do not yet have the broad
       recognition needed to ensure their acceptance.
     * To ensure that basic biomedical science has access to the broadest
       possible intellectual resources in our society. This will require a
       biomedical research workforce that reflects the composition of the
       U.S. population, including women, minorities, and individuals with
       disabilities.

Training

     * To establish programs that will result in a cadre of highly
       qualified researchers. This requires developing flexible training
       mechanisms that reflect the rapidly changing needs of science, as
       well as providing cross-disciplinary training.
     * To tap the talents of all members of society. This requires that we
       stimulate and encourage Ph.D.-granting institutions to establish or
       improve programs for identifying, recruiting, retaining, and
       training women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities for
       careers in the biomedical sciences.
     * To stimulate the training of investigators who can help translate
       the findings of basic research into medical benefits. This involves
       both pre- and postdoctoral training of M.D. researchers.
   __________________________________________________________________

Process for the Development of Initiatives

   Each year, NIGMS produces a number of initiatives or policy statements
   that are intended to reflect aspects of science that require particular
   attention or stimulation. These are developed through the following
   procedures:

Identification of Areas for New Targeted Initiatives

     * Meetings of groups of investigators reflecting the research areas
       supported by the Institute are held at frequent intervals. These
       groups are asked to consider areas of need and barriers to the
       progress of research.
     * Institute staff members, through their contacts with the scientific
       community, develop approaches to address important research areas.
       These emerge through discussions with grantees and applicants, and
       by attendance at scientific meetings.
     * The National Advisory General Medical Sciences (NAGMS) Council
       generates recommendations for new initiatives.

Evaluation of Proposed Initiatives

     * Following discussion with senior Institute staff and with the NAGMS
       Council, some of the initiatives are further examined in workshops
       organized by the Institute. At least one member of the Council is
       usually a participant in these workshops.
     * The workshop outcomes are discussed with the full Council, and a
       decision is made as to whether an initiative is warranted.

   In addition, periodic evaluations of broad program areas are carried
   out. To determine if adjustments are needed in its program areas, NIGMS
   examines whether some research fields are undergoing significant
   change, either through growth or shrinkage. An Institute-wide retreat
   is held about once a year to discuss issues of management and
   programmatic balance.
   __________________________________________________________________

Areas of Special Interest

   The development of broad areas of interest emerges from discussions
   with the scientific community, Institute staff, and the NAGMS Council.
   These areas are examined yearly to determine whether they still reflect
   the dynamics of the science the Institute supports. The primary support
   provided by the Institute for these areas, as well as others within our
   mission, remains investigator-initiated, unsolicited, individual
   research grants.

   In general, most research relevant to our mission requires only that
   NIGMS provide appropriate levels of support and administrative
   oversight, but does not require planning that leads to targeted
   research programs. However, discussions with the scientific community
   held in recent years suggest that the move to a "post-genomic" era has
   resulted in significant changes in the way some research is being
   conducted. Most prominently, there has been widespread agreement on the
   need for significantly broader collaborative interactions than have
   been the norm to this time; that access to a broader array of
   technologies will be required; and that practitioners of disciplines
   such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, and physics need to
   be involved in basic biological research.

   Most, but not all, of these changes can be accomplished through the
   traditional NIGMS approach of investigator-initiated, individual
   research grants. However, some targeted efforts may be required to
   facilitate new directions in research. This is reflected in some of the
   areas of special interest and the accompanying initiatives listed
   below.


                               Current Areas of Special Interest

              * The Study of Complex Systems
              * Promotion of Collaborations
              * Development of and Access to Research Tools
              * New Approaches to Training

The Study of Complex Systems

   During the past several decades, biomedical investigators have used
   ever-more-sophisticated research tools to identify and analyze the
   functions of the components that make up living systems. Although there
   are many approaches to mapping interactions between molecules, there
   are only a few attempts to approach the operation of complex biological
   systems that involve multiple genetic and molecular interactions that
   vary over space and time. These include a number of areas of central
   importance to the Institute, among them, for example, questions of
   complex multigene and gene product interactions, signal transduction,
   and multi-organ dysfunction.

   The goal is to promote analysis of the design principles and dynamic
   behaviors of complex biological systems, with the expectation that such
   an understanding will ultimately impact the treatment of human
   disorders and disease. If successful, these design principles should be
   presented in formats that readily allow testing by both computer
   analysis and in vivo approaches.

Promotion of Collaborations

   A consistent theme of all of the advisory groups that NIGMS has
   recently convened is the need to develop significant collaborations in
   order to address current and future research problems in biomedicine.
   Many important questions can only be addressed by applying a diverse
   set of tools and disciplines. In many cases, these cannot reasonably be
   expected to reside in a single individual or even a single laboratory.
   Furthermore, the development of informational structures, such as
   databases, or physical assets, such as gene chips or combinatorial
   libraries, may require broad collaborative efforts directed to a common
   goal. Although existing mechanisms, such as the program project grant,
   can address some of these needs, they are not sufficiently flexible to
   accommodate all needs.

   The goal is to conduct experiments in new approaches to the
   organization of scientific efforts, all targeted to significant
   research ends.

Development of and Access to Research Tools

   The tools that are needed by an individual investigator who is focusing
   on a biological problem can now range from molecular biology to
   high-resolution NMR, the use of synchrotron facilities, mass
   spectrometry, or the analysis of DNA arrays. Computer capabilities
   alone represent a major concern. Providing access to all these, and
   other, technologies is a daunting but essential task. Additionally, the
   development of new tools is needed to probe still deeper into the
   operation of living cells and organisms. This includes the systematic
   generation and analysis of large datasets and material resources in
   areas of biological importance.

   The goal is to ensure that technological capabilities are developed as
   needed and made widely available.

New Approaches to Training

   The evolution of the biological sciences continues to require the
   incorporation of new skills in the training of investigators. In
   particular, the rapid development of bioinformatics as a discipline of
   increasing importance in biology has generated a demand in both
   industry and academia that clearly is not being met by the available
   supply of highly trained investigators. In addition, the need to have
   scientifically trained individuals play a larger role in society may
   require new approaches to training.

   The goal is to ensure that training programs meet the evolving needs of
   biomedical research through the development of new training areas and
   new approaches to training, and to allow for training to meet a variety
   of possible scientific career outcomes for the trainees.
   __________________________________________________________________

A Vision for the Future: A Complete Picture of the Healthy Cell

   A primary effort in biomedical science has been to identify and
   characterize the molecular components of living systems. The
   development of concepts and tools--in particular from molecular
   genetics, structural biology, and genomics--has accelerated this
   process, so that the possibility of a complete catalog of molecules,
   their structures, and their functions seems highly likely in the
   foreseeable future. In addition, such a catalog can be arrayed in
   different ways to illustrate the various structural and functional
   relationships between molecules. This level of organization, which has
   been likened to a periodic table of molecular components, is a first
   step in understanding the normal functioning of the cell and
   subsequently in understanding the way it malfunctions. It is necessary
   to then move to the equivalent of a wiring diagram that shows the
   linkage between cellular components. This too is well under way,
   although it is by no means as advanced as the catalog. Finally, it will
   be necessary to understand how the cell operates as a system, with both
   spatial and temporal dimensions of cellular functions defined and
   understood. We have barely begun to address this problem.

   A major goal of the Institute is to arrive at a complete understanding
   of the normal functioning of the living cell. This would include all
   the aspects mentioned above--the catalog of structure and function, the
   understanding of intermolecular linkages that lead to a wiring diagram,
   and ultimately the understanding of intracellular behavior and
   intercellular interactions in time and space. Although there is a wide
   diversity of cell types in nature, there are characteristic features in
   common that should allow a representation of a prototype cell, or
   cells, which will also lead ultimately to an understanding of how
   integrated cellular functions become disordered in disease.
   __________________________________________________________________

Ongoing and Planned Activities

   The initiatives featured below reflect only a sampling of NIGMS'
   efforts. A complete listing of NIGMS programs, policies, and
   initiatives can be found on the NIGMS Web site
   (http://www.nigms.nih.gov). Items with an asterisk (*) indicate that
   the effort was jointly initiated by NIGMS and at least one other NIH
   component.

   Current Policies
     * Preference is given in funding to new investigators and
       investigators with no other source of support.
     * Interim funding is usually provided to competing renewals that are
       within about 10 percentile points beyond the Institute's funding
       range.
     * A special program has been established to encourage high-impact,
       high-risk research (see
       http://www.nigms.nih.gov/funding/pa/r21.html).

   Major Research Initiatives

   Pharmacogenetics

   Pharmacogenetics is the science of how a person's genes influence how
   he or she responds to medicines, including antidepressants,
   chemotherapy, and asthma drugs. NIGMS is leading a trans-NIH effort in
   which a network of investigators will store data in an electronic
   library that is freely accessible to the scientific community. The
   first nine awards for the pharmacogenetics network were made in April
   2000. The long-term goal of this research is to help doctors tailor
   doses of medicine to a person's unique genetic make-up. This will make
   medicines safer and more effective for each individual. The initiatives
   in this area are described at
   http://www.nigms.nih.gov/pharmacogenetics.

   Protein Structure Initiative

   This initiative, often referred to as "structural genomics," is
   designed to reveal the 3-D structure of all proteins in nature. Knowing
   the shapes of proteins helps scientists to better understand how
   proteins function normally and how faulty protein structures can cause
   disease. NIGMS has organized a large-scale effort in structural
   genomics, which involves determining the detailed structures of
   selected proteins, then predicting the structures of most other
   proteins from their gene sequences. This initiative is described at
   http://www.nigms.nih.gov/funding/psi.html. In September 2000, NIGMS
   provided the first year of funding for seven pilot research centers,
   each of which will be funded for 5 years. The goal is to develop a
   database of protein structures. In 10 years, NIGMS hopes to have 10,000
   structures in a database that will be freely available to the
   scientific community. The results of this initiative should advance the
   current understanding of protein folding, the evolution of protein
   structures, and the relationship between gene sequence, protein
   structure, and protein function.

   Consortium ("Glue Grant") Awards

   NIGMS created an initiative to "glue" together large groups of
   scientists pursuing some of the biggest unsolved problems in medical
   research today. The purpose is to support the formation of large
   research teams to tackle problems that are inaccessible to individual
   research laboratories. In September 2000, NIGMS made the first "glue
   grant" to a consortium of basic scientists that is studying
   communication within and between different cells. The consortium has
   already compiled a list of more than 2,400 proteins involved in
   cellular communication. By eventually creating a "virtual cell,"
   scientists will be able to design "wiring diagrams" for healthy cells.
   This should greatly enhance the process of developing drugs for
   treating a wide spectrum of diseases, including heart disease. The
   initiative is described at
   http://www.nigms.nih.gov/funding/gluegrants.html.

   New Approaches to the Study of Complex Biological Processes

   NIGMS has created a set of initiatives to promote quantitative,
   interdisciplinary approaches to studying complex biological systems.
   Such approaches are necessary to begin to understand the complex,
   interactive behavior of the many systems in the body, such as how cells
   communicate and how organs "talk" to each other. The long-term goals of
   such studies include understanding all of the genetic and environmental
   factors that work together to regulate processes, such as the
   development of embryos or of complex disorders like heart disease. A
   key part of this effort is recruiting mathematicians, physicists,
   engineers, and computer scientists to work on these medical problems.
   Descriptions of the initiatives in this area are available at
   http://www.nigms.nih.gov/funding/complex_systems.html. A few of these
   initiatives are described below.
     * Joint NSF/NIGMS Initiative to Support Research in Mathematical
       Biology (http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf01128) Together with
       the National Science Foundation's Division of Mathematical
       Sciences, NIGMS is sponsoring an effort to support both the
       development of new mathematical approaches as well as new
       applications of existing mathematical theory and practice to
       biomedical problems. Examples include statistical, predictive, or
       other mathematical approaches to the study of various cell
       behaviors, molecular structure and dynamics, the physiological
       effects of various drugs and their genetic and environmental
       modifiers, and human systemic responses to burns and other
       traumatic injury.
     * Training Programs in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology NIGMS
       has established individual postdoctoral training fellowships
       (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-98-082.html) as
       well as institutional predoctoral training programs
       (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-99-146.html) in
       computational biology and bioinformatics.
     * Centers of Excellence in Complex Biomedical Systems Research
       (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-GM-01-001.html)
       These centers will encourage interdisciplinary research, train
       undergraduates in quantitative biology, recruit and train in
       biology investigators who have quantitative backgrounds, and
       disseminate knowledge in this area.

   Other Initiatives

   Synchrotron Support

   The number of solved protein structures has exploded in recent years,
   due in large part to the availability of powerful X-rays from
   synchrotrons. To further advance the field of synchrotron-based X-ray
   crystallography and to reduce the waiting time for researchers seeking
   access to synchrotrons, NIGMS announced the initiatives below.
     * Support of Five U.S. Synchrotrons NIGMS is supporting major
       instrumentation enhancements and the hiring of additional staff at
       four U.S. synchrotrons (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Menlo
       Park, CA; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Advanced Light
       Source in Berkeley, CA; Brookhaven National Laboratory's National
       Synchrotron Light Source in Upton, NY; and the Cornell High Energy
       Synchrotron Source in Ithaca, NY). Together with NSF, it is also
       supporting development of a beamline at Louisiana State
       University's Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices in
       Baton Rouge, LA.
     * *Three New Beamlines at Argonne's Synchrotron NIGMS, in partnership
       with the National Cancer Institute, is planning to develop and
       operate three new "beamlines" at the Advanced Photon Source, the
       newest and most advanced U.S. synchrotron, which is located at
       Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, IL.

   More Powerful NMR Machines

   Another technique used to determine detailed, 3-D molecular structures
   is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A breakthrough in
   technology has allowed the construction of a new generation of more
   powerful NMR spectrometers. These new instruments contain extremely
   strong magnets (900 MHz) and provide much clearer pictures of many
   molecules than do current machines. These molecules, which include
   large proteins, flexible proteins, and carbohydrates bound to lipids or
   proteins, are critical for many biological functions. This initiative
   (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-GM-01-005.html) will
   provide a few of these new machines to groups of scientists who will
   use them to develop new methods and biological applications.

   Improving Tools and Techniques for High-Resolution Electron Microscopy

   Many cellular structures and functions are too large to be studied with
   X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
   cannot be viewed in adequate detail by light microscopy. Such
   structures can be examined using high-resolution electron microscopy
   (EM), but current high-resolution EM techniques are not advanced enough
   to be used for routine, high-throughput studies. NIGMS supports the
   development of improved instrumentation (see
   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-00-083.html) and,
   together with two other NIH institutes, supports technology development
   in this area (see
   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-00-084.html).

   Detection and Manipulation of Single Molecules

   Scientists studying the behavior of biological molecules usually must
   rely on the average behavior of many of these molecules. To do so, the
   researchers often must isolate the molecules from their natural
   environment and may even freeze, crystallize, or otherwise preserve the
   molecules in one position. Several new techniques allow researchers to
   examine and manipulate individual molecules and to examine the behavior
   of these molecules under natural conditions in living cells and in real
   time. These techniques enable scientists to examine a variety of
   biological processes at the single-molecule level. Such processes
   include the opening and closing of ion channels, the folding of protein
   and RNA molecules, the movement of molecular machines, variations in
   the efficiency of individual enzymes, and the expression of genes in
   specific tissues or at certain developmental stages. NIGMS supports the
   development of new technologies and methods to improve the detection
   and manipulation of single molecules (see
   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-01-049.html and
   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-01-050.html).

   Metals in Medicine

   Scientists (and nutritionists) have known for decades that a huge
   number of biochemical reactions in living systems require the presence
   of metals such as iron, copper, calcium, and zinc. They also know that
   at high levels, even such essential metals can be toxic. But very
   little is known about how metals are handled in the body and how they
   regulate cellular processes. NIGMS encourages research in this area
   through an initiative described at
   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-01-071.html. Although
   drug development is not the primary focus of this initiative, such
   studies could lead to new drugs, diagnostics, and other clinical
   benefits.

   Chemical Library and Method Development

   In recent years, chemists have learned to create huge collections of
   different molecules made from a few chemical building blocks. These
   collections are known as combinatorial chemistry libraries. Scientists
   are already using these libraries to rapidly screen thousands of
   molecules to discover potential new drugs, but their use is limited by
   current methods. NIGMS supports collaborative research "Centers of
   Excellence" (see
   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-GM-01-006.html) in
   which chemists, biologists, and engineers work together to develop new
   ways to create and maintain these libraries and to enhance their
   quality and diversity so they can be used to study biological
   processes.

   *Evolution of Infectious Diseases

   Infectious diseases evolve as a result of intricate relationships
   between hosts, pathogens, and vectors. Understanding the evolution and
   population dynamics of infectivity, host response, virulence, vector
   preferences and switching, coadaptation, and drug resistance is an
   important step in the control of infectious diseases. The initiative is
   described at
   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-GM-99-005.html.

   *Enhancing the Usefulness of Model Organisms

   To conduct large-scale genetic research or other studies that would be
   difficult or impossible to conduct in humans, scientists turn to
   simpler organisms that are genetically and biochemically similar to
   humans. Each such "model organism" has its own strengths and scientific
   uses. NIGMS supports research and technology that make these models
   more useful. Examples of such support are below.
     * Zebrafish These inexpensive, fast-growing fish are useful for
       studying basic biological processes, such as gene regulation,
       chromosome organization, cell growth and differentiation, sex
       determination, behavior, and the genetics of complex traits. The
       eggs are transparent, making them particularly valuable for studies
       of embryonic development. Zebrafish are also capable of a number of
       genetic tricks, such as producing offspring that contain genes only
       from one parent (as either haploids or homozygous diploids), which
       offer unique genetic research opportunities. See the announcements
       at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-01-095.html and
       http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-01-070.html.
     * Generic Model Organism Database Several major model organism
       databases collect and organize comprehensive genetic and genomic
       information, making it easily available to the research community.
       NIGMS and the National Human Genome Research Institute are
       co-sponsoring an initiative to develop database components, or
       modules, designed to perform specific data analysis functions. The
       modules will process genetic and genomic data in formats that are
       compatible with existing databases and will thus allow data sharing
       between these databases. In addition, the modules can be put
       together to form a "generic" model organism database, which will
       serve as a template for future model organism databases.

   Programs for Underrepresented Minorities

   NIGMS is committed to supporting research and research training
   programs that increase the number of minority biomedical scientists in
   the United States. Two such programs are highlighted below:
     * Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) This program
       (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-00-139.html)
       encourages underrepresented minorities who recently earned a
       baccalaureate degree in the biomedically relevant sciences to
       pursue a research doctorate. The program is designed to train
       scientists who eventually will address the health problems that
       disproportionately affect minorities and the medically underserved
       people of this country, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
       cancer, arthritis, respiratory diseases, HIV and other STDs, and
       substance abuse.
     * Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) Together with
       the Indian Health Service, NIGMS announced the NARCH initiative
       (see
       http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-GM-00-007.html) to
       develop the research capabilities of Native American/Alaska Native
       faculty and students. The initiative fosters partnerships between
       American Indian or Alaska Native tribes or organizations and
       research-intensive institutions. These partnerships are designed to
       develop a cadre of American Indians/Alaska Natives engaged in
       high-quality research, to encourage such research on diseases and
       health conditions of importance to native communities, and to
       increase the capacity of both the research-intensive institutions
       and the tribal organizations to work together to produce
       competitive research proposals.

   Programs to Reduce Health Disparities

   A number of diseases and health conditions disproportionately affect
   minority and medically underserved communities in this country. In
   addition to the two initiatives mentioned directly above, NIGMS
   supports a third initiative designed to reduce health disparities in
   the United States.
     * Pharmacogenetics Research Network Supplements for Health
       Disparities
       (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-01-004.html
       ) These supplements are designed to expand the research objectives
       beyond the original scope of the pharmacogenetics initiative. The
       supplements will support studies that link differences in responses
       to medicines with genes that are more common in certain population
       groups. Such knowledge could contribute to a reduction in health
       disparities by improving doctors' abilities to identify and treat
       individuals who have these genes.
