            WINDY M. HILL NAMED HEAD START ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER
     __________________________________________________________________

   HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson today announced the appointment of
   Windy M. Hill as associate commissioner of the Head Start Bureau, which
   runs America's premier early childhood development program that serves
   more than 900,000 low-income, preschool children each year.

   "Windy Hill brings real-world experience with Head Start, overseeing
   centers in Texas that provide comprehensive services to many children,"
   Secretary Thompson said. "Her experience will allow us to build on the
   program's strong record of success at preparing young children for
   successful lives."

   Since 1993, Hill has served as executive director of Cen-Tex Family
   Services, Inc., which administers nine Head Start centers in a
   four-county region of central Texas. As a child, she was enrolled in
   Head Start in Bastrop, Texas, and as a parent, her child also enrolled
   in the program. She served as a parent representative on the center's
   policy council and later was part of a community group that became a
   Head Start grantee.

   As associate commissioner, Hill will oversee the Head Start program,
   which has a budget of more than $6.5 billion in fiscal year 2002. Her
   appointment was effective Jan. 8, 2002.

   "Windy Hill brings a lifetime of involvement and commitment to the
   principles of the Head Start program," said Wade F. Horn, assistant
   secretary for children and families. "This program contributes greatly
   to the development of thousands of children each year, and we will work
   together to continue to improve the quality of Head Start and help all
   children reach their full potential."

   Established in 1965, Head Start is a national program providing
   comprehensive child development services to eligible low-income
   children and their families. To help children achieve their full
   potential, Early Head Start and Head Start provide comprehensive
   health, nutritional, educational and social services. The Head Start
   Bureau is part of HHS' Administration for Children and Families.
