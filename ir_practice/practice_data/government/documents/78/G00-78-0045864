   space The sixth planet from the Sun, Saturn, is the second largest
   planet in our solar system. Its intricate ring system has fascinated
   astronomers for centuries. The rings are made of ice and rock
   particles--some as big as houses--that were probably pieces of comets
   or asteroids that broke up before they reached the planet.

   At least 30 moons orbit Saturn. The largest, Titan, exceeds the size of
   the planets Mercury or Pluto and wraps itself in a dense, nitrogen-rich
   atmosphere reminiscent of the early Earth's atmosphere.

   Three NASA spacecraft, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, flew past
   Saturn during a span of less than 24 months in 1979-1981, but none have
   visited the dramatically ringed world since then. The Cassini-Huygens
   mission, a cooperative endeavor of NASA, the European Space Agency and
   Italy's space agency, is on its way. When it arrives in 2004, Cassini
   will go into orbit for an extended study of the Saturnian system and
   will release the Huygens probe to parachute through Titan's atmosphere
   in early 2005.
