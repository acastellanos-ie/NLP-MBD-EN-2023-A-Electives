   McKenna Praises TIB Project List
   TIB Chair McKenna Says Puget Sound Receives Priority Funding

   Metropolitan King County Councilmember Rob McKenna today announced that
   over $10 million in 2002 Transportation Improvement Board (TIB) grants
   will go toward projects in the Puget Sound Region. McKenna, who is
   currently the chair of the TIB, says the grants will make the most of
   available dollars and provide real solutions to local traffic
   congestion and safety issues. In total, the TIB announced $38.5 million
   in grants for 64 projects in cities and counties across the state.

   "While our Legislative leaders in Olympia are doing their best to come
   up with funding solutions to our region’s traffic problems, we must
   move forward and make the best use of existing dollars," said McKenna.
   "This year’s TIB program is once again doing a top notch job of
   distributing money across the state and this region. As has been the
   case in the past, the Puget Sound region has fared well."

   The Legislature created the TIB to foster state investment in quality
   local transportation projects. Funds are awarded on a competitive basis
   using rating criteria established by the TIB, and usually require local
   financial participation. The grant funding comes from the revenue
   generated by three cents of the statewide gas tax allocated to TIB
   projects by the Legislature.

   The TIB funding allocated today is broken down into three categories:

   Arterial Improvement Program
   (AIP): $30.2 million for 27 local agency projects. (When combined with
   $17.2 million in local funds, the improvements are valued at over $47.4
   million.) AIPs address safety, congestion and pavement condition, on
   the local arterial network in the urban areas and in rural cities with
   populations of 5,000 and over.

   Small City Program
   (SCP): $6.1 million for 20 local projects. When combined with $2.7
   million in local funds, the projects are valued at $8.8 million. SCPs
   are designed to address: safety, congestion, and pavement conditions on
   local arterial networks in cities with populations under 5,000.

   Small City Pedestrian Safety and Mobility Program
   (SC/PSMP) $1.4 million for 16 projects. When combined with $500,000 in
   local funds the improvements are valued at over $1.9 million. Criteria
   for SC/PSMPs: administrating safety and walking route connectivity on
   the local route networks.

   "When these projects are complete, communities in our state’s most
   urbanized neighborhoods will see a real improvement in mobility and
   pedestrian safety. From Hunts Point to Lake Forest Park to Des Moines,
   this year’s TIB grant allocations will go a long way to making the most
   of available gas tax dollars," said McKenna.

   For the biennial state budget period ending 2003, the TIB will have
   allocated approximately $210 million in program expenditures across all
   of Washington state. Of that, $121 million will be spent in the Puget
   Sound region.

   A sampling of the grant awards include projects in the following areas:

   send to Olympia every time they visit the fuel pump," said McKenna.
