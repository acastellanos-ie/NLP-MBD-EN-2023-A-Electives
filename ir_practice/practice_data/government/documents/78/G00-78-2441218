                          MINE WASTE CHARACTERIZATION

   Thousands of historical mine-waste piles are present on inactive
   metal-mining sites, some of which are on federal lands and have been
   abandoned. Assessment of metal mobility, acid-drainage production, and
   toxic effects from the weathering of historical mine-waste piles is an
   area of growing need as the environmental effects of inactive
   mine-waste sites across the country are being evaluated and mitigated.

   The U.S. Geological Survey Mine Waste Characterization Project has
   taken a multidisciplinary approach to assemble, develop, and refine
   methods and tools for characterizing and screening weathered solid-mine
   wastes. Researchers from a variety of disciplines, including
   geophysics, geochemistry analytical chemistry, geology, mineralogy,
   remote sensing, and spatial modeling, have worked together at metal
   mining waste sites in Colorado and New Mexico to develop an integrated
   "toolkit" for the rapid screening and characterization of historical
   mine-waste piles. Detailed studies have been conducted at eight main
   mine-dump sites (six are located in Colorado), representing both
   igneous-hosted and carbonate-hosted polymetallic deposits, to examine
   the influence of carbonate materials. Two other sites are arid analog
   mine-waste piles in southwestern New Mexico chosen to examined the
   influence of climate. Tools developed from this work can be used in
   ranking and prioritizing historical mine-waste piles.
