   Glossary
   For the purposes of the computer crime case chart, the following words
   or phrases are defined.
   Interest Harmed - This category refers to the type of interest that was
   compromised by the computer crime:

     Confidentiality - A breach of confidentiality occurs when a person
     knowingly accesses a computer without authorization or exceeding
     authorized access. Confidentiality is compromised when a hacker
     views or copies proprietary or private information, such as a credit
     card number or trade secret.

     Integrity - A breach of integrity occurs when a system or data has
     been accidently or maliciously modified, altered or destroyed
     without authorization. For example, viruses and worms alter source
     code in order to allow a hacker to gain unauthorized access to a
     computer.

     Availability - A breach of availability occurs when an authorized
     user is prevented from timely, reliable access to data or a system.
     A popular example of this is a denial of service attack.

   Est. Dollar Loss - The estimated amount of damage that occurs as a
   result of the computer crime. The estimates in this table are rounded
   down from figures provided by law enforcement agents on the case.

   Target - This category indicates whether the computer crime targeted a
   private individual or corporation or a public governmental agency. It
   also indicates whether there was a threat to public health or safety:

   Threat to public health or safety occurs when a hacker targets or
   compromises data or a system within the national critical
   infrastructure (e.g., power grids, air traffic control, classified
   government data).

   Perpetrator Charged - Indicates whether the defendant is a juvenile or
   part of an organized group.

   Geography -

     International - Indicates that the computer crime originated from a
     foreign country or was conducted on an international scale.

     Sentence in months - refers to prison sentence or probation.

     Fine, Forfeiture, Restitution - the combined amount that the
     defendant must pay in fine, forfeiture or restitution.
