   Restoration of living resources and vital habitat is the highest
   priority of Chesapeake 2000. The CBP is developing plans to restore
   vital habitats and living resources including submerged aquatic
   vegetation and fisheries.

   developing conservation measures to protect water birds in the Atlantic
   Flyway. To develop the strategies to conserve and restore the
   ecosystem, scientific information is needed to understand the complex
   relation of living resources and associated habitats to environmental
   factors in the Bay and its watershed. The USGS will focus on
   documenting the factors affecting the health of fish and water birds
   and their habitats.

   Please visit the Programs and Projects page to find links to the USGS
   programs focused on the habitat and resources of the Bay. The Data page
   gives information and links on various USGS data and spatial
   information sites concerned with the Bay area and its associated
   habitats.

   We welcome comments and suggestions on this redesigned site.
