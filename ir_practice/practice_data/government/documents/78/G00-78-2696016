  Official GOES Project Douments

   GOES-R documents are on a restricted web site. You can click around
   through the "Spacecraft" and "Instruments" sections of the GOES Project
   web siteto find some materials. The most interesting sections are under
   "Instruments", for the new Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and Advanced
   Baseline Sounder (ABS) planned for GOES-R.

   Some handy public reference documents can be found here, at

    Imagers

     * ABI formulation contracts awarded: 30 April 2001
       NASA has awarded three $8 million contracts to Ball Aerospace and
       Technologies, Boulder, Co., ITT Industries, Fort Wayne, Ind., and
       Raytheon Santa Barbara Remote Sensing, Goleta, Calif., for
       formulation phase work on an advanced imager for the next
       generation of geostationary weather satellites operated by the
       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
       The new advanced sensor, called the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI),
       will be the primary instrument on NOAA's future Geostationary
       Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) beginning with the
       GOES-R mission which will be ready to fly in 2008. The ABI will
       provide the core data that the National Weather Service uses for
       routine weather forecasting and severe storm forecasting.
       Under terms of the firm fixed price contracts, each company will
       develop detailed engineering plans for the future instrument. NASA
       is expected to select a company in 2003 to build the instrument.

       the first color cameras in geosynchronous orbit. In 1999, JT Young
       at the University of Wisconsin digitized the ATS-3 color photos
