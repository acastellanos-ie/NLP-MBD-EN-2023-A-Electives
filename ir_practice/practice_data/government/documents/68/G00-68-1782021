   Data Product Levels and Processing
    1. What is the datum for Level 1G products?
       The Level 1 Product Generation System (LPGS) produces all Level 1G
       products in WGS-84.
    2. What is the geometric accuracy of a systematically corrected Level
       1G product?
       The Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) was designed to provide a
       geometric accuracy of at least 250 meters (1 sigma) in flat areas
       at sea level. For more information on accuracy, please see How does
       the use of definitive ephemeris information improve processing?
    3. What is the number of bits for the Level 1 radiometric (L1R)
       product?
       The L1R product is a 16 bit integer product. During L1R product
       rendering image pixels are converted to units of absolute radiance
       using floating point calculations. Pixel values are then multiplied
       by 100 and converted to 16 bit integers prior to product output.
       Two digits of decimal precision are thus preserved.
    4. Where can the number of lines and samples be located for a scene?
       Level 0R HDF products contain the number of lines in the
       Number_of_Scans field in the MTP file. This number must be
       multiplied by 16. The number of samples is always 6600. For Level
       1R and Level 1G HDF products, the MTL contains the number of lines
       and samples in the fields Product_Lines_bandgroup and
       Product_Samples_bandgroup respectively. The .hpn, .htm, and .hrf
       files of the Level 1G Fast L7A products contain the fields
       pixel_per_line and lines_per_band. For Level 1S NDF, the .H1, .H2,
       and .H3 files have the lines and samples in the respective fields
       of Lines_Per_Data_File and Pixels_Per_Line.
    5. What are the differences between products distributed by the NLAPS
       and LPGS USGS systems?
       The two USGS systems which distribute Landsat 7 Level 1 products
       are:
          + National Land Archive Production System (NLAPS)
          + Level 1 Product Generating System (LPGS)
       The NLAPS products are orderable through the Earth Explorer. The
       LPGS products are orderable through the EOS Data Gateway. There are
       several inherent differences between the NLAPS and LPGS L1
       products. Some of these differences are listed below.
         a. The first difference is that the edges are trimmed differently
            in the two products. The LPGS does not trim the image edges
            while NLAPS does. For an illustration of the differences that
            will occur in the images because of this, see Figure 1.

            NLAPS Product LPGS Product
            Figure 1 NLAPS product (shown at the left) has had the edges
            of the image trimmed (note left edge of image) whereas
            products generated by the LPGS (shown at right) have not had
            the edges trimmed (note left edge of image).
            For additional information on the LPGS edges and the browse
            images, please see the FAQ 'Why is there band mismatching
            along the edges of the image?' under the 'Calibration and
            Quality' section.
         b. Another difference that will occur is the placement of the
            first line, first sample (1,1) and end line, end sample pixel
            locations for the pan (band 8) and thermal (band 6) data sets
            (the visible and near-IR bands are handled the same way on
            both systems). The center of the 1,1 pixel is the X, Y map
            location listed in the header records of the images. The LPGS
            system centers all bands about a common center x,y location.
            The centers will be aligned but the edges are not. The NLAPS
            edges align all bands but lose center point consistency.
            Figure 2 & Figure 3 illustrate the differences in the corner
            point location handling of the systems. The large box is the
            thermal pixel at 60 m. The middle box is the visible and
            near-IR pixel at 30 m. The smallest box is the panchromatic
            pixel at 15 m.
            LPGS images
            Figures 2 and 3 LPGS alignment is shown on the left and NLAPS
            alignment is shown on the right. The upper left coordinates of
            the pixels will vary for products produced by LPGS between the
            thermal, reflective and panchromatic bands. For NLAPS
            products, the upper left coordinates of each band will remain
            the same, but center point consistency is lost.
         c. In GeoTIFF products there is a difference in the tiff header.
            Both systems have the BitsPerSample tag set to 8. The NLAPS
            product will also have the SampleFormat tag set to unsigned
            integer format. LPGS does not use the SampleFormat tag in its
            GeoTIFF products, even though they are also unsigned integer
            format.
         d. When applying the radiometric corrections (Level 1 product),
            the LPGS system scales the output values of the image data
            from 1-255. The zero value is reserved for fill data. NLAPS
            scales the output values of the image data from 0-255 and also
            uses 0 for the fill data. Some of the pixels in NLAPS will
            have valid 0 values while other 0 value pixels will be fill
            data.

         e. Gimbaled X-Band Antenna (GXA) slewing is handled differently
            on the 2 systems.
            Data anomalies that most visibly appear as scan line offsets
            or extensions can occur when the GXA redirects itself from one
            ground station to another. Level 1 processing may correct this
            problem in some instances. LPGS will estimate an 'End-of-Line'
            (EOL) and process the scans with that estimated number. The
            data will be offset but will be available. NLAPS defines no
            EOL as 'no data', and will zero-fill the affected scans.
    6. What is the difference between Nominal and North Up oriented
       systematic Level 1G images?
       Landsat 7 nominal (NOM) images are oriented similarly to the path
       of the satellite (path-oriented), which means that the top of the
       image is not map north (Figure 1). This can be an advantage for
       certain types of image filtering methods which operate more
       accurately on images where the line, sample grids are closer to the
       original satellite's scan lines. However, for a user requiring a
       map product for use in a geographic information system (GIS), the
       NOM imagery would not be as desirable, because most commercial GIS
       and image processing software packages will load NOM data as it is,
       and will not correct for its rotational offset. For a GIS ready
       product, Level 1G North-Up (NUP) imagery is recommended (Figure 2).
       NUP or map-oriented imagery has been resampled so that the image
       line, sample grid is aligned with a map projection's X, Y grid.
       When imported into a GIS or image processing software, the top of
       NUP imagery is map north, and the imagery can be treated as a map
       product.
       Residual error in the systematic L1G product (NOM and NUP) is less
       than 250 meters (1 sigma) in flat areas at sea level. The
       systematic L1G correction process does not employ ground control or
       relief models to attain absolute geodetic accuracy. See 'A
       Comparison of Landsat 7 Processing Levels' for more information.

    7. Do thermal values in bands 6L and 6H represent absolute or relative
       temperatures?
       Absolute.
