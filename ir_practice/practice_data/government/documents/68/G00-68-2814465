   News
   There's a lot going on in the Origins Program and related world
   research. To keep track of all the excitement, we've organized our news
   into 5 categories:
     * The Story of the Universe - Scientists reveal their latest
       discoveries about the formation and development of galaxies, stars,
       planets, and the chemical conditions necessary to support life.
     * The Search for Extra-Solar Planets - We've now found more planets
       outside of our solar system than the familiar nine within it. Stay
       tuned for ever increasing numbers!
     * The Quest to Understand Life - The astrobiology community shares
       their most recent insights about life and its marvelous diversity.
     * Media Spotlight - Origins frequently captures the attention of the
       media and the interest of the public. These feature articles
       provide particularly in-depth coverage of our endeavor.
     * Mission Highlights - Keep in touch with mission news and the people
       who are making Origins possible.
