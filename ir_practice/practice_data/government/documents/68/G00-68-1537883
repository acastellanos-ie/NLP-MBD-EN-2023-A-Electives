   PrePRINT Network Help The Department of Energy's PrePRINT Network is a
   searchable gateway to preprint servers that deal with scientific and
   technical disciplines of concern to DOE.  Such disciplines include the
   great bulk of physics, materials, and chemistry, as well as portions of
   biology, environmental sciences and nuclear medicine.

   With a single query, users can search one or a selected set of existing
   preprint servers.   The Network pulses the search engines of such
   servers, compiles the results, and returns them to the users.  With the
   PrePRINT Alerts feature, users can create personal profiles to match
   their interests.  Users then receive notification of new information
   that matches their profile.

   The PrePRINT Network complements PubSCIENCE, DOE's tool for searching
   across journal literature, and the Information Bridge, DOE's vast
   production of full-text R&D gray literature issued since January 1995.

   Note:  Special viewers may be required to view some of the preprints.
