   The Data Management and Programming Office provides computer support to
   members of the Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics (LHEA), in
   support of x-ray, gamma ray and cosmic ray research and flight
   projects. The Office is responsible for computer science support, local
   computer and network capabilities, software development and data
   management. Staff members also function as in-house consultants,
   working with LHEA researchers to determine the hardware/software
   approaches most likely to meet science objectives.

   Office members manage local workstations, local networks, connections
   to the Center network environment, and the associated networking
   hardware (e.g. bridges and routers) and software. They assist
   scientists in choosing hardware and software to meet their needs; they
   procure it, install it and maintain it, arranging for repairs as
   necessary. They are also responsible for planning of optimal networks
   and subnets, use of new technologies as they come along,
   troubleshooting network problems, computer and network security, and
   support for personal computers. Additional information about the LHEA
   Computing Environment is available for access from GSFC sites only.

   Software development support for LHEA projects spans the development
   life cycle, from requirements definition and analysis, to testing and
   delivery of operational systems. The development effort concerns itself
   with the entire range of activities related to space-based astrophysics
   observations, from science operations and data product generation
   through archiving of the data, data search and retrieval, and data
   analysis support. This includes installation and maintenance of locally
   developed software as well as public domain and commercial
   off-the-shelf packages. LHEA software developers have been particularly
   active in building tools for multi-mission analysis of high energy
   astrophysics data, and making these tools available to the scientific
   community.

   The Office is also responsible for maintenance of data bases that are
   used by laboratory researchers, and for sensible management of the data
   files themselves. Data on tapes at the Center NCCS facility, data
   archives stored locally in Building 2, and data holdings in the Tape
   Staging and Storage Facility (TSSF) are managed by Code 664, with
   concurrence of the scientists responsible for the specific project.
   Office staff members also manage the interfaces to allow both internal
   and external users to access the data. This includes making large
   amounts of LHEA data and information available via the World-Wide Web.
