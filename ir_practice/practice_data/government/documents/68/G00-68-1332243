      Research Interests:

      We study the biochemical and biophysical bases for targeting and
      regulation of proteinase activity in four model systems.

   [clot.gif] Many extracellular physiological processes, fibrinolysis,
   even metastasis of tumor cells, are mediated by plasminogen activation,
   an enzyme system exquisitely regulated.

   [flea.gif] We discovered a proteinase activity in the outer membrane of
   E. coli that turns out to be a virulence factor in the organism that
   causes plague. With the U.S. Army we have begun vaccine trials against
   plague.

   [malaria_i.gif] We recently discovered a proteinase activity required
   for the invasion of red blood cells by the parasite that causes malaria
   and are currently trying to identify and purify it.

   [adeno3.gif] Virus-coded proteinases are attractive targets for
   antiviral therapy. We showed the human adenovirus proteinase requires
   two cofactors, an 11 amino acid peptide and the viral DNA. We have
   solved to 1.6Ã… the crystal structure of the proteinase-peptide complex
   and are currently designing and synthesizing antiviral agents based
   upon the crystal structure.
