                NIMH Genetics Research Branch (GRB) Programs

   The GRB is one of the five branches of the Division of Neuroscience &
   Basic Behavioral Science (DNBBS) at the National Institute of Mental
   Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health (NIH). Research activities
   supported by the GRB are organized and categorized into one of three
   programs of research. These programs provide conceptual cohesion and
   structural integrity to the current portfolio of over 130 grants and
   contracts administered by the GRB, as well as to all new research
   project applications assigned to the GRB for consideration for funding.

   The GRB supports research on the localization, identification, and
   regulation of genes involved in NEURAL FUNCTION; the localization and
   identification of genes that influence BEHAVIOR; and the localization
   and identification of genes that influence susceptibility to
   SCHIZOPHRENIA, MOOD DISORDERS, AND OTHER BRAIN DISORDERS. Animal
   research paradigms include selectively bred animal strains, recombinant
   inbred animal strains, transgenic animal strains, and gene targeting
   (e.g., knock-out and knock-in techniques); human research paradigms
   include family, twin, and adoption studies. Research methods and
   techniques are employed from fields as diverse as molecular genetics,
   statistical/population genetics, genetic epidemiology, molecular
   biology, and basic neuroscience.
   GRB Program Descriptions
     * GENETIC BASIS OF NEURAL FUNCTION PROGRAM - Chief, Hemin R. Chin,
       Ph.D.
       This program supports interdisciplinary neuroscience research in
       animal and human tissue on the localization, identification, and
       regulation of genes involved in all aspects of neural functioning
       (e.g., neuroendocrine and neuroimmunologic systems,
       neurodevelopment, Circadian rhythms). Program areas include:
          + Characterization of transcription elements (e.g., promotors,
            enhancers, silencers) that regulate genes showing
            tissue-specific expression patterns in the CNS
          + Regulation of genes expressed in neural cells at different
            developmental stages
          + Regulation of the alternative splicing of primary gene
            transcripts to yield tissue-specific products
          + Regulation of genes involved in neuronal signaling that affect
            different forms of synaptic plasticity (e.g., long-term
            potentiation)
          + High-resolution mapping and identification of genes
            influencing neural functioning through positional cloning or
            "forward" genetic approaches (positional candidate gene and
            position-independent candidate gene approaches)
          + Use of selectively bred, recombinant inbred, and transgenic
            animal strains and gene targeting (e.g., knock-out and
            knock-in techniques) to identify genes that influence neural
            function
          + Development of new technologies to understand the control and
            regulation of orphan genes (i.e., genes of unknown function)
            isolated from brain regions
     * GENETIC BASIS OF BEHAVIOR PROGRAM - Chief, Mary E. Farmer, M.D.,
       M.P.H.
       This program supports interdisciplinary neuroscience research on
       the localization and identification of genes - including
       quantitative trait loci (QTLs) - that influence behavior (e.g.,
       memory, emotionality, learning, cognition) in animal and human
       populations. Program areas include:
          + Characterization of the mode of inheritance through the
            estimation of heritability and of relative gene effects
          + Estimation of the relative contributions of genetic and
            environmental factors to familial transmission through the use
            of quantitative genetic methods like path analysis
          + Characterization of gene-environment interaction through
            statistical modelling and environmental manipulation
          + Localization of genes to particular genomic regions
          + High-resolution mapping and identification of genes through
            positional cloning and "forward" genetic approaches
            (positional candidate gene and position-independent candidate
            gene approaches)
          + Identification of genes through linkage disequilbrium mapping
            in population- and family- based association studies
          + Identification of genes through the use of selectively bred,
            recombinant inbred, and transgenic animal strains and gene
            targeting (e.g., knock-out or knock-in techniques).
     * GENETIC BASIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, MOOD AND OTHER BRAIN DISORDERS
       PROGRAM - Chief, Steven O. Moldin, Ph.D.
       This program supports interdisciplinary neuroscience research on
       the localization and identification of genes that influence
       susceptibility to schizophrenia, mood, and other brain disorders in
       human populations. Program areas include:
          + Determination and characterization of disease aggregation in
            families
          + Characterization of the mode of inheritance through the
            estimation of heritability and of relative gene effects
          + Specification of the relative contributions of genetic and
            environmental factors through the use of quantitative genetic
            methods like path analysis
          + Resolution of allelic or locus heterogeneity through
            statistical and molecular characterization
          + Localization of susceptibility genes to particular genomic
            regions
          + High-resolution mapping and identification of susceptibility
            genes through positional cloning and "forward" genetic
            approaches (positional candidate gene and position-independent
            candidate gene approaches)
          + Identification of susceptibility genes by linkage
            disequilbrium mapping in population- and family-based
            association studies
          + Development of molecular techniques for the genetic
            modification of human cells (gene therapy) that can be applied
            to treat brain disorders
