   SFMOMA and San Francisco Film Society Film Series Screening of Greed
   February 14

   Directed by Erich von Stroheim/reconstructed by Rick Schmidlin. Never
   seen in its entirety, von Stroheims powerful drama is one of the most
   influential silent films ever made. Much of the ten hours of original
   footage was lost after the film was reduced to two hours by studio
   editors. Producer and silent film scholar Rick Schmidlin attempted to
   recreate the film using 650 stills and von Stroheims long-lost
   continuity script. He will introduce his reconstructed version of the
   classic film. Running time: 250 minutes. General admission tickets $15;
   advance purchase is recommended. Tickets can be purchased at the SFMOMA
   admissions desk, or online at www.sffs.org or at www.ticketweb.com.
   Please call for more information.
