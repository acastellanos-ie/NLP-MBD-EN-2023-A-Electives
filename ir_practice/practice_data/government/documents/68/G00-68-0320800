Federal Computer Products
Center (FCPC)

   The Center was established at NTIS to provide access to information in
   electronic formats. The current inventory of computer products includes
   more than 1,200 titles since 1990. These include datafiles, databases,
   and software on diskette, CD-ROM, and magnetic tape.

   Most of the Center's products are developed or sponsored by the federal
   government. However, NTIS does announce products developed by state
   governments and in a few cases by private sector organizations and
   distributed by NTIS.
