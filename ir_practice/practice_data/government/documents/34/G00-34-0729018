                       Health Commissioner Billittier
                             Talks About ANTHRAX

   Obviously, there has been much concern recently about anthrax. Anthrax
   is a bacteria that is capable of forming spores (or "seeds"), which can
   become airborne and germinate many years later. Anthrax can infect the
   body through three routes: skin (cutaneous), lungs (inhalation), and
   stomach and intestine (gastrointestinal). Below are my thoughts and
   some answers to commonly asked questions about anthrax.

   What are the symptoms?
     * Skin: Cutaneous anthrax may occur following contact of spores
       through a break in the skin. The first symptoms may include a
       discoloration and itching where the skin has been exposed. Later, a
       large boil or sore appears. Eventually, a black scab covers the
       sore. If not treated the infection can spread to lymph nodes and
       the blood stream.
     * Inhalation: Inhalational anthrax may occur if spores (perhaps about
       8,000 - 10,000) are breathed into the lungs. First symptoms include
       fever, fatigue, malaise and a cough or chest pain. High fever,
       rapid pulse, and severe difficulty breathing follow in 2-5 days.
       Inhalational anthrax is often fatal, but can be successfully
       treated especially if antibiotics are initiated early in the
       course.
     * Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal anthrax may occur following
       ingestion or eating infected, undercooked meat or other food or
       drink contaminated with anthrax. First symptoms include fever,
       abdominal (stomach) pain, loose or watery bowel movements, and
       vomiting of blood.

   What should I do if I have been exposed to a powder or other unknown
   substance?
   It is important to remember that the goal of terrorism is fear.
   Therefore, don't let the terrorists win. First STOP, relax, try to
   think objectively, and assess your risk. Honestly ask yourself:
   "would/could a terrorist target me by doing this?" Very often the
   answer will be "no". However, if you are still concerned after a
   thoughtful risk assessment, take the following precautions:

     * Wash your hands and any other potentially exposed skin with
       ordinary soap and water. Wash your hair with shampoo only if
       potentially exposed. And, wash potentially exposed clothing with
       laundry detergent.
     * Call 911 and allow your local police to objectively assess your
       risk. Rest assured that they will take further action if they
       believe the threat to you could be credible.

   What should I do if I have signs or symptoms that I think could be from
   anthrax?
   Again, it is important to first STOP, relax, try to think objectively,
   and assess your risk. Honestly ask yourself: "would/could a terrorist
   have infected me with anthrax?" Without a recent credible exposure, the
   answer will very likely be "no." Chances are your symptoms are due to
   some other more common medical ailment such as the flu or some other
   virus infection. However, if you are still concerned after a thoughtful
   risk assessment, take the following precautions:

     * Contact your doctor immediately. If you do not have a doctor, you
       should contact a community health center or go to a local emergency
       department. Don't expect or insist on a nasal swab or antibiotics.
       Public health authorities are using nasal swabs for epidemiological
       (i.e., public health) purposes only. Further, the CDC and New York
       State Department of Health currently advocate strongly that
       antibiotics should not be prescribed except for a documented
       anthrax exposure.

   What is the treatment for anthrax?
   Tests conducted on anthrax found in other parts of the United States
   have shown that the bacteria can be treated with several antibiotics
   including ciprofloxacin (Cipro), doxycycline (Doxy), and various types
   of penicillin.

   Can an infected person spread anthrax?
   Inhalational anthrax is not transmitted from person to person. There is
   a very low risk that cutaneous (skin) anthrax can be spread to other
   persons, but only by direct contact with the drainage from the open
   sore.

   How can I protect myself from contracting anthrax?
   Remember that the best way to prevent or fight anthrax or any other
   infectious disease is to be in good health. Therefore, don't smoke, eat
   right, visit your health care provider regularly, and take all
   medications as prescribed. A healthy lifestyle is still your best
   defense against bioterrorism!
