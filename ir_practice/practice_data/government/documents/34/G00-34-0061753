   This position is located in the Health Promotion Research Branch,
   Behavioral Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population
   Science, of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The 5 A Day Program is
   a national program that approaches Americans with a simple, positive
   message: Eat 5 or more servings of vegetables and fruit daily for
   better health. The Program, a partnership between the vegetable and
   fruit industry and the NCI had four major components: mass media, point
   of purchase, community coalitions, and research. Over the past 10
   years, it has emerged as the most prominent population-based initiative
   focused on cancer prevention through dietary change. Currently, 55
   states and territories and all U.S. Uniformed Services are licensed by
   the NCI to spread the 5 A Day message, and the PBH has licensed over
   1,000 industry participants, which includes over 30,000 supermarkets.
   NCI has recently undertaken a thorough review of the 5 A Day Program,
   resulting in a series of recommendations for the next phase of the
   Program (visit www.5aday.gov for the online Report). The most
   significant recommendation was for national expansion. The goal of the
   expansion is to integrate 5 A Day into each partner agency's and
   organization's programmatic efforts and to support the expansion of 5 A
   Day programs in each state.
