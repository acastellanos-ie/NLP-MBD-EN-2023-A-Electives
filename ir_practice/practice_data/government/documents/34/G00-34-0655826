                           Center for Beam Physics
          ________________________________________________________

     The Center for Beam Physics is a multidisciplinary research and
     development unit in the General Sciences sector of Berkeley Lab,
     affiliated with the University of California. It is part of the
     Accelerator and Fusion Research Division and has strong interactive
     collaborations with the Physics, Nuclear Science, Material Science
     and Advanced Light Source Divisions. At the heart of the Center's
     mission is the fundamental quest for mechanisms of acceleration,
     radiation, transport, and focusing of energy and information.
     Dedicated to exploring the frontiers of particle and photon beam
     physics, its primary mission is to promote the science and
     technology of the production, manipulation, storage, and control of
     systems of charged particles and photons, often in the form of
     "beams" with directed energy and embedded information as applied to
     studies of the fundamental structure and processes of the natural
     world. The Center serves this mission via conceptual studies,
     theoretical and experimental research, design and development,
     institutional project involvement, external collaborations,
     association with industry, and technology transfer. These activities
     support exploring the next steps in the development of particle
     accelerators, further continuing the tradition of pioneering
     accelerator research at the Laboratory since its inception in 1932.
     The program of the Center is not limited to specific programmatic
     categories of the Department of Energy, but rather serves wide areas
     of research. The research program of the Center is directly linked
     to advances in high-energy and nuclear physics, condensed-matter
     research, the material and chemical sciences, physics of high energy
     density, the life sciences, and various industrial applications.
