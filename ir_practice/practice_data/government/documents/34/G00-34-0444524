               No. 32                        December 5, 2001

   S. 1731 -- Agriculture, Conservation and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001

     Calendar No. 237

     Reported from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry
     on November 27, 2001, by voice vote. No written report.

                                 NOTEWORTHY
     __________________________________________________________________

     * The Majority Leader filed a cloture petition on the motion to
       proceed to S. 1731 on Friday, November 30. By unanimous consent, a
       roll call vote on cloture will occur today.
     * The current farm bill does not expire until September of 2002. S.
       1731, as the new farm authorization, would authorize farm and
       nutrition programs through 2006, perpetuating a cycle of low prices
       and overproduction that is then reinforced by further emergency
       subsidies.
     * Senators Lugar, Cochran, and Gregg are expected to offer
       substantive amendments to this bill [see Possible Amendments
       section of this Notice].

     * The House passed its version of the farm bill reauthorization, H.R.
       2646, on October 5 by a vote of 291-120. The Administration did not
       support that bill and urged its consideration be deferred.
     * The Administration in its Statement of Administration Policy issued
       today stated its strong opposition to S. 1731 and urged support of
       the Cochran-Roberts amendment.

     * S. 1731 establishes a new "national" dairy income support program,
       effectively imposing a new tax on milk. Expect Senators Crapo and
       Bingaman to offer an amendment to strike this provision. The bill
       also contains a commodity title providing about $44 billion in
       subsidies for overproduced commodity crops such as wheat, cotton
       and corn.

     * The bill, according to CBO, spends $40.86 billion in mandatory new
       funding above the baseline over the next five years, and $73.44
       billion over the next ten years.

                                 HIGHLIGHTS
     __________________________________________________________________

     S. 1731 as reported continues Depression-era commodity programs that
     are proven to encourage over-production of traditional program crop
     commodities which will continuously lead to lower prices for
     producers.
     * The bill does not allow 60 percent of farmers to benefit from
       federal farm programs.

     * The bill's commodity title provides about $44 billion on subsidies
       for overproduced commodity crops such as wheat, cotton and corn.

     * In addition to the support for commodities, the bill provides
       greater incentives for land conservation and energy production, and
       includes assistance for economic development in rural areas.
     * The bill does not adequately support welfare reform or adequately
       fund nutrition programs for poor people.

     * The bill establishes a new "national" dairy income support program,
       imposing what is in effect a new tax on milk. The University of
       Missouri's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute
       estimates the program would raise milk prices by a average of 26
       cents a gallon, costing consumers about $1.8 billion a year. The
       cost of the dairy provisions has been taken off-budget.

     * The bill, according to CBO, spends $40.86 billion in mandatory new
       funding above the baseline over the next five years, and $73.44
       billion over the next ten years.

     Commodity Title.

     1. Direct Payments and Counter-Cyclical Payments.

     The bill authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with
     producers that will entitle producers to receive both direct
     payments and counter-cyclical payments on eligible cropland for the
     2002 through 2006 crop years. Producers will have the option of
     having these payments based on (1) updated acreage and yield history
     (average of the 1998-2001 crop years) for all covered commodities
     (corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, wheat, soybeans, minor oilseeds,
     upland cotton, and rice) on the farm or (2) existing AMTA (market
     loss assistance) base acres and program yields and adding oilseeds
     acres.

     Analysis: Existing AMTA program yields, which have been frozen for
     many years, are generally based on actual yields from the early
     1980s. As a result, most producers are expected to update acreage
     and yields as they seek to maximize government-provided direct and
     counter-cyclical payments.
     * Direct Payments: Producers would receive direct payments equal to
       the product of the base acres times the program yield times the
       direct payment rate as specified below. Direct payments shall be
       paid not later than September 30 of each of the fiscal years 2002
       through 2006. At the option of the producer, 50 percent of the
       direct payment would be paid on or after December 1 of the fiscal
       year.
     * Counter-Cyclical Payments: The payment rate for counter-cyclical
       payments would equal the difference between the "Safety net price"
       (written in the bill -- see table below) minus the direct payment
       minus the higher of the five-month average price or the loan rate
       for the crop. Producers would receive counter-cyclical payments
       equal to the product of the base acres times the program yield
       times the counter-cyclical payment rate. The counter-cyclical
       payment would be made after the five-month price is established,
       but no later than 190 days after the beginning of the marketing
       year.

        Rice      cwt       $9.30       $6.85    $2.45    $1.225  $0.6125

     Analysis: The Committee bill's direct payments for both 2002 and
     2003 crops for wheat, corn, cotton, and rice are significantly
     higher than would occur under current law for the 2002 crop year
     because the Committee bill's direct payment rates are generally
     higher compared to current law and are paid on a larger volume of
     eligible production due to the acreage and yield update producers
     are permitted. In addition, unlike the current law's direct AMTA
     payments, the Committee bill makes direct payments available to
     soybean and minor oilseed producers for the first time.
     Counter-cyclical payments are generally not expected to trigger
     until the 2004 crop year when the Committee bill would begin to
     phase down direct payments.

     Many analysts believe that although the Committee bill's direct and
     counter-cyclical payments are based on historical production, the
     provision that allows producers to receive these payments based on
     updated acreage and yields effectively rewards producers who have
     chosen to increase production of program commodities in recent
     years. This will tend to encourage producers to continue to produce
     these crops in the years ahead, regardless of market signals.
     * Contract Requirements: As under current law, conservation
       compliance, wetland protection, and restrictions on the planting of
       fruits and vegetables are requisite for direct and counter-cyclical
       payments.
     * Payment Limitations: The maximum amount a producer can receive for
       direct and counter-cyclical payments combined in one year is
       $100,000. The three-entity rule still applies so that a producer
       could receive as much as $200,000 in annual payments ($100,000 on
       the first entity and $50,000 each on the second and third).

     2. Marketing Loans and Loan Deficiency Payments.
     * The Committee bill continues the current marketing loan program for
       each of the 2002 through 2006 crops, providing nine-month
       nonrecourse loans for producers of wheat, corn, grain sorghum,
       barley, oats, rice, soybeans, minor oilseeds, upland cotton, wool,
       mohair, honey, dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas. Current
       conservation compliance and wetland protection would apply. Loan
       rates would be increased for all crops except for soybeans, which
       is lowered from $5.26 to $5.20 per bushel.

   * Except rice, dry peas, lentils and chickpeas in $/cwt.; cotton, wool,
                          mohair & honey in $/pound

     * Annual payment limitations are increased from $75,000 to $150,000.
       The Committee proposal also ends authority for generic commodity
       certificates that have been widely used by large producers in
       recent years to evade the marketing loan program's payment
       limitation.

     Analysis: Virtually all agricultural economists agree that
     increasing marketing assistance loan rates, whose benefits are based
     on the production of the supported commodity, will encourage greater
     production of these commodities.

     3. Dairy, Sugar, and Peanuts.
     * Dairy. Continues the price support program at $9.90 per
       hundredweight through 2006. Establishes a national counter-cyclical
       income support program for dairy producers. The bill, as it was
       originally marked up by the Committee a few weeks ago, included the
       Sanders/Leahy proposal for a national counter-cyclical income
       support program for dairy producers. That program featured higher
       minimum prices ($14.25/cwt) for Class I fluid milk, a deficiency
       payment system for manufacturing milk used to make cheese, butter,
       etc., and regional boards authorized to give dairy producers within
       their respective regions incentives to lower production. In S.
       1731, the program has been restructured and, instead of newly
       constituted boards in each federal marketing order region
       administering the program, it will be administered by the Secretary
       through the existing federal milk marketing orders and the four
       classifications of milk (Classes I-IV). This change reportedly was
       made in order to avoid potential budgetary problems.

     Because this program is administered through the existing federal
     marketing order structure, not all states are eligible as they would
     have been in the program's previous form. California, for example,
     is not a part of the federal structure and so that state's producers
     would not be able to participate.

     * Sugar. Eliminates the marketing assessment on sugar, reduces the
       CCC interest rate on price support loans, authorizes a
       Payment-in-Kind program, reestablishes the no net cost feature of
       the program and provides the Secretary with authority to implement
       allotments on domestic sugar production. The loan forfeiture
       penalty on sugar also is eliminated.

     Analysis: The Senate Committee bill maintains many of current law's
     sugar program provisions. The taxpayer cost of this is expected to
     be about $530 million in mandatory new spending above baseline over
     the next ten years.
     * Peanuts. The quota-based peanut program is modified by establishing
       a new peanut program that tracks other commodities by paying
       benefits on 100 percent of base acres. The program provides direct
       payments of $100 per ton for 2002 and 2003, $50 per ton for 2004
       and 2005, and $25 per ton for 2006. It establishes a safety net
       price for peanuts of $500 per ton and a loan rate of $400 per ton.
       The payment rate for counter-cyclical payments would equal the
       difference between the safety net price minus the direct payment
       minus the higher of the season average price or the loan rate for
       the crop. The bill terminates the marketing quota program and
       compensates quota holders for the loss of the quota asset value at
       10 cents per pound per year for five years.

     Analysis: The taxpayer cost of this is expected to be about $4.2
     billion in mandatory new spending above baseline over ten years,
     nearly $0.7 billion more than the House-passed peanut provisions.
     Peanut processors and manufacturers are expected to benefit
     substantially from lower farm prices for peanuts that will occur as
     a result of this taxpayer-financed buyout, but peanut users are not
     asked to share its cost.

     4. Miscellaneous Commodity Provisions

     * Specialty Crop Purchases. Requires the Secretary to purchase $130
       million of commodities items annually for 2002 and increases
       gradually to $200 million by 2006. Not less than $100 million of
       the commodities must be specialty crops in 2002 ($170 million in
       2006), and not less than $50 million must be used to supplement
       funds already provided by USDA to the Department of Defense for the
       purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables for the National School
       Lunch Program. Not less than $40 million is to be provided to the
       Emergency Food Assistance Program.
     * Hard White Wheat. Designates $40 million of CCC funds to provide a
       per bushel incentive payment for production of Hard White Wheat
       (HWW). The proposal says the incentive "will assure sufficient
       production of HWW to enable the United States to establish domestic
       and overseas markets for this specialty wheat."

     Conservation Title

     This title would increase funds for conservation on land in
     production while expanding land retirement programs.
     * The major new item in the Committee-approved conservation title is
       the creation of a new Conservation Security Program that provides
       incentive payments to all farmers to maintain and adopt
       conservation practices.
     * Funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is
       increased to $1.25 billion by FY 2006.
     * The bill also increases acreage for the Conservation Reserve
       Program (CRP) to 40 million acres from the current 36.4 million
       acre limit.

     A listing of the major programs is as follows:

   Program

     Committee Levels

   Conservation Reserve Program 40 million acres
   Wetlands Reserve Program 250,000 acres/yr
   Farmland Protection Program Ramp to $250 million/year
   Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program Ramp to $125 million/year
   Env. Quality Incentives Program Ramp to $1.25 billion/year
   Grasslands Reserve Program 2 million acres
   Conservation Security Program New - covers working lands

   Analysis: Overall, the Conservation title makes great strides in
   achieving a better balance between land retirement programs (such as
   the Conservation Reserve Program) and working lands programs (such as
   the Environmental Quality Incentives Program). Currently, some 85 cents
   out of every conservation financial assistance dollar goes toward land
   retirement programs; 15 cents goes toward conserving land that remains
   in production. This imbalance is significant, and, under the
   Committee-passed bill, it is estimated that the amount of funding going
   toward land retirement would drop to 55 cents on the dollar and the
   amount going toward working lands would jump to 45 cents. The Committee
   bill contains a new Conservation Security Program, and it not clear at
   this time how the program will work at the field level.

   Trade Title

     * Food Aid. S. 1731 establishes the International Food for Education
       and Nutrition program (effectively an international school lunch
       program), which began as a pilot in 2000, as a function within the
       Food for Progress statute and funds the program at a maximum of
       $200 million a year in mandatory spending for five years. The
       Secretary has the discretion to fund the program at the level she
       sees fit out of the Food for Progress program. The bill alters the
       programs with the primary goal of making the food aid approval
       process less onerous for the Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs)
       and giving them greater flexibility in administering the programs
       on the ground.
     * Market Promotion Programs. The bill increases funding for the
       Market Access Program (MAP) and includes certain reforms in order
       to make more creative use of the market promotion programs and to
       try to target the programs toward new and emerging markets.
     * Export Credits. The bill reauthorizes the Export Enhancement
       Program (EEP) at the current maximum WTO-allowable levels. However,
       it defines exchange rate manipulation by competing exporters and
       questionable pricing practices by state trading enterprises as
       unfair trade practices. This provision may promote greater use of
       EEP by encouraging its use to offset such practices.
     * Export Credit Guarantees. S. 1731 reauthorizes the export credit
       guarantee programs, providing for a minor change in the Supplier
       Credit Guarantee program to facilitate its usefulness.
     * New Initiatives. The Committee-passed bill provides several new
       initiatives designed to facilitate U.S. agriculture exports,
       including a biotechnology education and outreach initiative
       (mandatory funding of $15 million annually for 2002-06).
     * Other Provisions. The bill strikes restrictions on private
       financing of sales of food and medicine to Cuba, which were
       established in the FY01 Agriculture Appropriations bill.

     Additionally, a Sense of Congress resolution is included which
     establishes Congressional priorities and concerns for bilateral and
     multilateral agricultural trade negotiations.

   Nutrition Title
     * Food Stamp Program Changes. Key provisions to simplify the program
       include allowing the states to conform Food Stamp income rules with
       those of Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance or
       Medicaid and resource rules with those of TANF. Other
       simplification proposals address procedures for calculating
       household utility allowances and shelter deductions, as well as
       benefit amounts for residents of certain group living arrangements.

     * Food Stamp Program Capacity. Work support proposals focus on
       reduced household reporting burdens to make it easier to combine
       work with Food Stamp program participation. The title also
       increases the length of time that a household can receive
       transitional Food Stamp benefits after leaving the cash assistance
       program (TANF) from three to six months, and provides a more
       generous transition benefit to more persons.
     * Quality Control System. This title is similar to the House proposal
       which substantially raises the error-rate threshold resulting in
       automatic state sanctions and which reduces the dollar amount of
       sanctions states pay out. It differs from the House provisions by
       eliminating bonus payments to states with error rates below 6
       percent and by introducing authority for the Secretary to
       investigate state administrative practices when error rates
       indicate serious negligence.
     * State Flexibility. The bill establishes new criteria for rewarding
       states for good performance with bonus payments. It calls for
       choosing performance measures in consultation with USDA and state
       organizations for which six states will share $30 million each
       year.

     The Committee bill offers new initiatives to promote state projects
     in the areas of Food Stamp outreach, community food security and
     agriculture issues, as well as fruit and vegetable consumption.

     * Emergency Food Assistance. With respect to immigrant policy, the
       Committee bill restores eligibility and eliminates sponsor-income
       deeming for all immigrant children. It also restores eligibility
       for some disabled persons, and eliminates the seven-year
       eligibility limit on refugees. It reduces the Food Stamp time
       limits previously set up for able-bodied adults without dependents.
       The Committee bill moves from the current three-plus-three months
       in 36 months to a time limit of six months in every 24-month
       period. It also adds job search as a new category of qualifying
       work activity.

     The bill links the standard income deduction to the poverty line
     which results in indexing by household size and adjusting annually
     for inflation.

     * Food Choices and Better Nutritional Status. The bill makes vitamins
       and minerals eligible Food Stamp items, creates an electronic
       repository for nutrition education materials, and requires two
       pilot tests to be conducted which promote consumption of fresh
       fruits and vegetables in schools and the larger community.
     * Commodity Assistance Programs. S. 1731 reauthorizes the pertinent
       commodity assistance programs and adds additional funds to the
       Emergency Food Assistance Program (EFAP). In addition, the bill
       targets some funds in the EFAP and Commodity Supplemental Food
       Program to cover the costs of food storage and distribution. The
       Committee title reauthorizes the Community Food Project grant
       initiative and increases the federal match rate for these projects,
       as well as authorizing the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition
       Program.

   Analysis: The nutrition title adopted by the Senate Agriculture
   Committee incorporates many of the Food Stamp provisions in Senator
   Lugar's farm bill, S. 1571. Collectively, the Committee nutrition
   package represents a positive step toward a simpler and more
   streamlined Food Stamp program. It does not go far enough, however,
   toward supporting welfare reform.

   Credit Title
     * The main emphasis of this title is to reauthorize USDA's direct and
       guaranteed loan programs and to make credit more accessible to
       beginning farmers and ranchers, including improving the terms for
       the Beginning Farmer Down-Payment Program, the Interest Rate
       Reduction Program and the Participation Loan Program.
     * It authorizes USDA to refinance bridge loans to beginning farmers
       when federal funds have temporarily been expended, reserves a
       portion of funding authorizations for beginning farmers, and grants
       the Secretary the tools to dispose of inventory lands to beginning
       farmers.
     * This title includes provisions to simplify and streamline federal
       credit programs.
     * It reauthorizes all USDA farm direct and guaranteed loan programs
       and increases the loan authorization levels: $3.75 billion for each
       fiscal year, with $750 million for direct loans annually ($200
       million for farm ownership loans, and $550 million for farm
       operating loans), and $3 billion for guaranteed loans ($1 billion
       for farm ownership loans, and $2 billion for ownership loans).

   Rural Development

   The rural development title includes the major policy initiative of
   providing approximately $472 million in mandatory funding in FY 2002 to
   eliminate the backlog for water and waste grants and direct loans,
   community facility grants and direct loans, rural water or wastewater
   technical assistance and training grants, solid waste management
   grants, and B&I guaranteed loans.
     * Broadband access. The bill authorizes a loan and grant program to
       expand rural broadband access to communities of 20,000 or less,
       providing $100 million annually in FY 03-06 in mandatory money.
       Initial allocations to states are to be made based on the number of
       communities in a state with populations of less than 2,500.
     * Value-added Product Market Development Grants. This program was
       created and funded in FY 2001 in the Agricultural Risk Protection
       Act. The Committee bill expands the definition of a value-added
       agricultural product and extends the program, but proposes to do so
       with $75 million annually in mandatory money, with a priority for
       grant proposals for less than $200,000 and a 5-percent set-aside
       for organic products. The provision also provides additional
       funding for the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center created in
       the original Ag Risk Protection Act authorization.
     * The Rural Endowment Pilot Program. This program would provide
       initial grants of $100,000 to rural areas of populations less than
       75,000 for the purpose of developing long-term comprehensive
       community development strategies and endowments for economic
       growth. These initial grants would then be followed by grants
       averaging $6 million each to communities to fund an endowment to
       support the comprehensive community development strategy. The bill
       provides for technical assistance grants and a 50-percent match
       (except for small, poor rural areas determined by the Secretary
       where the match will be 20 percent). The program is funded for FY
       2002 and 2003 with $82 million in mandatory spending: $5 million
       for planning grants, $2 million for technical assistance, and $75
       million for endowment grants.
     * Grants for Rural Firefighters and Microenterprises. The Committee
       bill would provide $10 million in mandatory funds in FY02 and $30
       million per year in FYs 2003-06 for grants to State and regional
       training centers, and local organizations, for training of
       firefighters and first responders, and $10 million in mandatory
       funds per year for grants to nonprofit organizations to provide
       low- and modest-income rural entrepreneurs with training and
       microloans of up to $35,000.
     * Business and Industry Loan Modifications. The Committee bill makes
       several modifications to the B& I program sought by cooperatives,
       including: authorizing B&I loans to a farmer to buy stock in
       existing cooperatives provided cooperative membership is necessary
       for the farmer to sell his agricultural product; allowing a
       cooperative in an urban area to receive B&I funding as long as the
       funding were devoted to a project in a rural area; limiting upfront
       B&I fees to no more than 2 percent; allowing USDA to use
       specialized appraisers instead of general appraisers when that is
       the private sector standard; and allowing cooperative borrowers to
       refinance with either an existing or new lender.
     * Venture Capital. The Committee bill includes two venture capital
       mechanisms, only one of which will receive mandatory funding.

     The first is the National Rural Cooperative and Business Equity Fund
     based on the similar Harkin/Craig proposal in the last Congress. As
     revised, private investors could create the fund and manage it with
     a board of 14 members, 3 of whom would be appointed by the Secretary
     and the rest of whom would represent private investors. The first
     $150 million of investments in the Fund would be matched by USDA;
     USDA would guarantee 50 percent of the private investments up to a
     total guarantee of $300 million, and the Fund could raise additional
     capital by issuing debentures that USDA could guarantee the
     principal of up to a maximum of $500 million. This program is funded
     with discretionary funds in such sums as are necessary.

     The second venture capital proposal is to fund Rural Business
     Investment Corporations (RBIC) based on the SBA Small Business
     Investment Corporation model. Again, USDA would be required to have
     SBA manage the program. USDA would guarantee the debentures of an
     RBIC equal to 300 percent of its private capital for a period of
     five years and a 1-percent fee. Mandatory funding for this program
     (preliminary CBO estimate at $120 million) will cover the subsidy
     costs for a program level of a maximum of $350 worth of guarantees.

     * Other Provisions. The Committee bill also includes an authorization
       for a rural telework grant program; an authorization for grants to
       nonprofit entities to capitalize revolving funds to finance
       pre-development and replacement capital equipment replacement costs
       for water and waste disposal projects; an express authorization of
       appropriations for grants for statewide nonprofit public television
       broadcasting systems; a requirement for an expedited application
       process for water or waste disposal grants and loans for less than
       $300,000; an increase in the community facilities population
       threshold from 20,000 to 50,000; an authorization for grants to
       nonprofits which are willing to provide technical assistance at no
       or low cost to rural entities; authorization for the Rural
       Utilities Service (RUS) to provide assistance for projects backed
       by tax-exempt bonds (requiring a tax code revision as a separate
       measure); an authorization for a historic barns preservation
       program; and an authorization for the Northern Great Plains
       Regional Authority.

   Research Title
     * The Committee-passed research title would spend $145 million per
       year in mandatory spending for the Initiative for Future
       Agriculture and Food Systems. The Committee-passed bill also
       provides mandatory spending for two new programs: rural policy
       research ($15 million per year) and a beginning farmer and rancher
       development program ($15 million per year).
     * The Committee bill includes the Agriculture Infrastructure Security
       Fund, an investment fund for ensuring the security and research
       capability of USDA labs requested by Secretary Veneman, but only
       with an authorization for discretionary funding. If funds are
       appropriated, this fund could be tapped for modernizing research
       facilities, equipment, and technology to safeguard against animal
       and plant diseases and pests and to protect food safety. Formation
       of a Commission also is authorized to advise the Secretary about
       modernization and closures of USDA labs.
     * Finally, an amendment offered at Committee markup of the
       miscellaneous title which authorizes a grant program for land-grant
       institutions for construction of research facilities for
       agrisecurity and bioterrorism research was included in the research
       title.

   Forestry Title
     * The Forestry title includes $48 million per year in mandatory
       funding for a new Sustainable Forestry Assistance Program that
       allows states broad discretion in allocating cost-share funds to
       private forest landowners for sustainable forest management and for
       permanent easements to prevent deforestation.
     * There is also a new $2 million per year program (also with
       mandatory funding) to promote sustainable forestry business
       cooperatives.

   The Forestry title also:
     * Adds authorization for a Sustainable Forestry Outreach Initiative
       (similar to the House provision) that provides educational
       assistance to forest landowners;
     * Increases the authorized level for the Renewable Resources
       Extension Act from $15 million to $30 million;
     * Adds an Enhanced Community Fire Protection provision (similar to
       the House) to increase the efficiency and coordination of
       fire-control efforts; and
     * Adds a Watershed Forestry Initiative (authorized at $20 million
       annually) to provide cost-share and technical assistance to
       increase and protect forests in watersheds.
     * Includes authorization for two Forest Fire Research Centers in
       western states. The Centers are to conduct research into
       ecologically sound fire control methods and then to transfer the
       findings to fire and land managers. Additionally, the Wildfire
       Prevention and Hazardous Fuel Purchase Program was added. This
       provision provides grants to entities that use forest biomass to
       generate electricity in or near communities with high risk of
       fires.
     * Authorizes long-term Forest Stewardship Contracts to remove
       hazardous fuels from forests and haul them to generating
       facilities. This title reauthorizes the international forestry
       programs, the Forestry Incentives Program, and expresses support
       for the permanently authorized McIntire Stennis cooperative
       forestry research programs. The Stewardship Incentives Program
       (SIP) is continued using appropriated funds, which currently amount
       to about $8 million per year.

   Energy Title
     * Biobased Product Purchasing Requirement. The bill requires the
       federal government to purchase biobased products whenever they are
       comparable in price, performance and availability to nonbiobased
       products and provided that they are also environmentally
       preferable. It dedicates $2 million per year in mandatory funding
       to implement it.
     * Biomass Research and Development Act. The Committee bill provides
       mandatory funding of $15 million per year for five years.
     * Carbon Sequestration Demonstration Project. The Committee bill
       provides grants to producers to assist in paying costs incurred
       measuring, estimating, monitoring, and testing methodologies
       involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and allowing for the
       trading of greenhouse credits.
     * Biorefinery Development Grants. The Committee bill creates a new
       program to help cost-share with industry, universities and national
       labs on testing the commercial viability of emerging technologies
       for converting cellulosic biomass into petroleum substitutes.
       Mandatory funding of $15 million per year is provided.
     * Renewable Energy. This title includes new programs to help farmers
       and ranchers and farmer- and rancher-owned cooperatives and
       business ventures to pursue renewable energy projects through loans
       and grants ($245 million over five years), to assist rural electric
       cooperatives in renewable energy projects, ($45 million over five
       years), to provide farmers and ranchers with energy efficiency
       audits and renewable energy audits ($75 million over five years),
       and to fund hydrogen and fuel cell technology research ($25 million
       over five years).

   Miscellaneous Title
     * Crop Insurance. The Committee provision makes permanent current
       law's temporary prohibition on so-called "continuous coverage" in
       plans of insurance offered through the federal crop insurance
       program effective with the 2006 crop year. Under continuous
       coverage, producers may select yield coverage in 1 percent
       increments. Without continuous coverage, they are limited to
       5-percent increments (50, 55, 60, 65 ,70 ,75, 80, and 85 percent of
       expected yields). Farmers prefer the flexibility of continuous
       coverage because it gives them greater ability to purchase the
       level of insurance coverage most appropriate for their needs.

   Analysis: This provision, originally included in the Committee bill's
   commodity title, was included to reduce the commodity title's overall
   budget score. It has the effect of reducing crop insurance program
   budget authority costs by about $300 million annually effective with
   fiscal year 2006. This provision is expected to score $1.5 billion in
   budget authority savings over the 10-fiscal year 2002-2011 period with
   all of the savings back loaded in the last five years.
     * Public Disclosure Requirements for County Committee Elections. This
       provision mandates certain procedures for county committee
       elections, and requires the Secretary to promulgate additional
       procedures based on statistics reported to her on county committee
       elections, to ensure openness and transparency in order to improve
       representation of socially disadvantaged farmers.
     * Country of Origin Labeling. This section from the rejected Harkin
       competition title was adopted as a stand-alone amendment during
       markup. This section requires retailers of beef, pork, and lamb,
       ground beef, ground lamb, and ground pork, fresh and frozen fruits
       and vegetables, and whole farm-raised fish, to inform consumers, at
       the final point of sale, of the country of origin of the covered
       commodity. A retailer may identify the commodity of United States
       origin only if the meat is from an animal that is exclusively born,
       raised, and slaughtered in the United States and, in the case of
       perishable agricultural commodities, is exclusively produced in the
       United States.

   Analysis: Despite claims that this is a food safety issue, this
   provision could undermine efforts to eliminate non-tariff barriers and
   increase foreign market access for U.S. agricultural exports.
     * Nonambulatory livestock. Amends the Packers and Stockyards Act to
       prohibit any stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer to buy or
       move nonambulatory livestock unless the livestock has been humanely
       euthanized.
     * Cockfighting. Amends the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the
       movement of animals in interstate or foreign commerce for the
       purpose of fighting, and increases civil and criminal penalties for
       violation of the Act.
     * Humane Slaughter. Expresses sense of Congress that Humane Methods
       of Slaughter Act should be fully enforced.

     * Tree Assistance Program. Amends the FAIR Act of 1996 to authorize
       disaster assistance, subject to appropriations, for eligible
       orchardists retroactive to 2000.
     * National Organic Cost-Share Program. Provides $3.5 million in
       mandatory funding for FY 2002 for the Secretary to establish a
       national organic certification cost-share program to assist
       producers and handlers to obtain certification under the national
       organic production program with payments of up to $500 and no more
       than 75 percent of the cost of certification.
     * Food Safety Commission. Authorizes establishment of a Food Safety
       Commission appointed by the leadership of the House and Senate to
       make recommendations for implementing the National Academy of
       Sciences report, entitled "Ensuring Safe Food from Production to
       Consumption."
     * Nutrition Information and Awareness Pilot Program. Authorizes a
       pilot program in not more than 15 states to increase the domestic
       consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.
     * Socially Disadvantaged Farmers. S. 1731 reauthorizes and slightly
       modifies the Section 2501 outreach program for socially
       disadvantaged farmers.

                           ADMINISTRATION POSITION
     __________________________________________________________________

   The four-page Statement of Administration Policy issued today said this
   (in part):

   The President has urged Congress to adopt farm policy that embraces the
   Administration's principles. Because new legislation will shape the
   future of U.S. agriculture in an unusually critical time, the
   Administration believes that the Senate should resist retreating to
   policies, such as those contained in S. 1731, that will ultimately harm
   our farmers and ranchers. Consequently, the Administration strongly
   opposes S. 1731, urges the Senate to defeat it, and supports the
   Cochran-Roberts Amendment ... which is consistent with the President's
   principles for sound farm policy. It provides for a strong safety net
   for farmers in times of low prices by continuing the current marketing
   loan program for traditional program crops, while better balancing loan
   rates. . . . The Administration would like to reiterate that higher
   loan rates are a stimulus for overproduction, which lowers prices.

                             POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS
     __________________________________________________________________

   Senator Lugar:

   Senator Lugar offers his perspective on the shortcomings of current
   farm policy:

     (1) Virtually all agricultural subsidies go to producers of just
     five program crops: corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, and rice. As a
     result, 60 percent of farms are excluded from Federal farm benefits.

     (2) Agricultural subsidies have been distributed according to
     acreage. This has resulted in the bulk of payments being distributed
     to large farming enterprises. In fact, 47 percent of payments went
     to just 8 percent of farmers.

     (3) The cost of U.S. agriculture policy to taxpayers has been large
     and unpredictable, even as it has failed to alleviate the farm
     crisis. Despite the record overall net cash farm income for this
     year of $61 billion, many producers, particularly small family
     farms, struggle to survive.

     (4) The current policy of Federal supports defies all economic
     logic. It perpetuates a cycle of low prices and overproduction that
     is then reinforced by further emergency subsidies.

   The contradictions of U.S. agriculture policy were described in the
   USDA's 2001 "Food and Agricultural Policy" book:

     "History has shown that supporting prices is self-defeating.
     Government attempts to hold prices above those determined by
     commercial markets have simply made matters worse time after time.
     Artificially higher prices encouraged even more unneeded output from
     the most efficient producers at the same time they discouraged
     utilization pushing surpluses higher and prices lower.

     "Supply controls proved unworkable too. . . the remaining land was
     farmed more intensively, and supply was rarely cut enough to boost
     prices to politically satisfactory levels. The programs were costly
     to taxpayers and consumers and the unused resources were a drag on
     overall economic performance . . . limiting our acreage was a signal
     to our competitors in other countries to expand theirs, and we lost
     market share that is always difficult to recapture. . ."

   S. 1731 unfortunately encourages continued overproduction of
   traditional program crop commodities which time and again will lead to
   lower prices for producers. The bill does not allow 60 percent of
   farmers to benefit from federal farm programs.

   Commodities

   Senator Lugar plans to offer a commodity title amendment under which
   any farmer or rancher with more than $20,000 of average annual gross
   farm income, regardless of the agricultural products he produces, would
   qualify for a voucher to buy crop insurance or other risk management
   tools (guaranteeing up to 80 percent of the farm's average market
   income over the previous five years) or to match deposits in an income
   stabilization account.

   The Lugar commodity title has been scored by CBO at $5.6 billion over
   five years (2002-06) and $25 billion over 10 years (2002-11) in
   mandatory new spending above the baseline.

   Nutrition

   Senator Lugar believes that more needs to be done in the area of
   nutrition. His amendment includes an increased spending level for
   nutrition compared to what is provided in the Committee-reported bill.
   As background, it's important to note that for the years 1996 through
   2001, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that welfare
   reform would reduce Food Stamp spending by over $21 billion. Over that
   same time frame, CBO estimated that farm program spending would be
   reduced by about $2 billion due to enactment of the 1996 farm bill.
   Thus, over 90 percent of the cuts in 1995 and 1996 occurred in the Food
   Stamp program.

   In fact, CBO underestimated the effects of welfare reform on the Food
   Stamp program. For the years 1996 through 2001, Food Stamp spending
   declined by about $50 billion, not the $21 billion CBO originally
   estimated. About half of that reduction was due to the changes in law
   made by welfare reform and an economy that was stronger than CBO
   anticipated. But the other half of the decline in Food Stamp
   participation among elderly families was due largely to the outdated,
   prescriptive nature of the current Food Stamp program.

   Thus, Food Stamps provided the vast bulk of the savings needed in 1995
   and 1996 and history has shown that the actual reductions were far
   bigger than expected. Some of those reductions were reinstated in later
   bills. Specifically, about $2 billion has been restored to the Food
   Stamp program. (An additional $30 billion has been added in commodity
   supports over the same time period). Given that such a large proportion
   of budget savings came from the Food Stamp program, it seems equitable
   that with substantial new agricultural resources, a significant share
   of the new money go to Food Stamps. The spending Senator Lugar is
   proposing goes to support the goals of welfare reform. Collectively,
   Lugar's proposed nutrition policies serve to replace complex Food Stamp
   rules with simpler ones, integrate the Food Stamp, Medicaid and cash
   assistance programs, offer many programs for state flexibility, and
   make the program more compatible with the goals of welfare reform.

   Eight out of ten of the Republicans on the Senate Agriculture Committee
   voted in favor of this nutrition amendment.

   Research Competitive Grants Amendment

   This amendment increases funding for the Initiative for Future
   Agriculture and Food Systems from the current $120 million per year to
   $360 million per year beginning in Fiscal Year 2003 and continuing
   through Fiscal Year 2006.

   This amendment will also rectify a significant and disappointing
   funding shortfall created in the Fiscal Year 2002 agricultural
   appropriations bill when funding for this program was prohibited,
   except for funds necessary to administer and conduct oversight of
   previously awarded grants.

   This is not a new program: This competitively awarded agricultural
   research program began with the 1998 agricultural research bill. This
   amendment simply continues this important existing program and would
   increase the funding level.

   Dairy Support Program Amendment

   Senator Lugar's amendment effectively phases out the subsidies provided
   under the existing federal dairy program. This amendment eliminates the
   milk price support program and the recourse loan program for
   processors, effective January 1, 2003. It also would streamline the
   current milk class structure from four classes to two (a class I for
   fluid milk and a class II for all other uses of milk). These two
   classes would be used to determine milk component pricing.

   The Senate Committee bill maintains many of the current dairy program
   provisions, but goes even further and establishes a new national
   counter-cyclical income support program for dairy producers. It
   continues the price support program at $9.90 per hundredweight through
   2006. CBO has scored this provision as costing taxpayers $3.0 billion.

   Senator Gregg:

   Peanut Program Amendment

   This amendment effectively phases out the subsidies provided under the
   existing federal peanut program. Specifically, this amendment phases
   out the peanut loan rate for quota and additional peanuts to $0 for the
   2006 crop. The marketing quotas and allotments will be progressively
   increased for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 crops in anticipation of the
   complete elimination of the marketing quota for the 2006 crop.

   The Senate Committee bill creates a new target price and marketing loan
   support program for peanut producers. The taxpayer cost of this is
   expected to be about $4.2 billion in mandatory new spending above
   baseline over ten years, nearly $0.7 billion more than the House-passed
   peanut provisions. Peanut processors and manufacturers are expected to
   benefit substantially from lower farm prices for peanuts that will
   occur as a result of this taxpayer-financed buyout, but peanut users
   are not asked to share its cost.

   Sugar Program Amendment

   Senator Gregg's amendment effectively phases out the subsidies provided
   under the existing federal sugar program. It proposes that the current
   price support program for sugar beets and sugarcane be converted into a
   system solely of recourse loans. This amendment would phase out the
   loan rate for sugar beets and sugarcane to $0 for the 2006 crop.
   Marketing allotments and quotas for both sugar beets and sugarcane
   would be eliminated beginning with the 2003 crop.

   The Senate Committee bill maintains many of the current sugar program
   provisions. It eliminates the marketing assessment on sugar; reduces
   the CCC interest rate on price support loans; authorizes a
   Payment-in-Kind program; reestablishes the no-net-cost feature of the
   program and provides the Secretary with authority to implement
   allotments on domestic sugar production. The loan forfeiture penalty on
   sugar also is eliminated. The taxpayer cost of this is expected to be
   about $530 million in mandatory new spending above baseline over the
   next ten years.

   Senators Cochran and Roberts:

   The Cochran/Roberts alternative provides a substitute for Titles I and
   II of the bill, providing a constant fixed payment. The conservation
   title of this farm bill proposal provides adequate funding and
   continues the successful programs of the 1996 FAIR Act.

   Title I -- Commodity Programs

   Agriculture producers enter into contracts and receive direct payments
   on eligible cropland for the 2002-2006 crop years. Direct payment rates
   are constant throughout the five-year life of the legislation.
   Producers would receive direct payments equal to the product of the
   base acres times the program yield times the direct payment rate.
   Payments would be paid no later than September 30th of each fiscal
   year. In the case of the 2002 crop, payments may begin on or after
   December 1, 2001. Legislation continues the restriction on planting
   fruits, vegetables, and wild rice.

   Direct payment rates are as follows:

     Wheat $0.7292/bu

     Corn $0.4128/bu

     Grain Sorghum $0.4953/bu

     Barley $0.344/bu

     Oats $0.0344/bu

     Cotton $0.1418/lb

     Rice $3.23/cwt

     Soybeans $0.5779/bu

     Other Oilseeds $0.0102/lb

   Producers are allowed three options regarding base acres: Maintain
   current base; Four-year average of acreage planted to a covered
   commodity in crop years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001; or Current base acres
   plus oilseeds.

   Non-recourse loans and loan deficiency payments will be made available
   for producers of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, cotton, rice, soybeans,
   wool, mohair, honey, dry peas, lentils and chickpeas. Legislation
   continues the cotton competitiveness program. Loan rates are set as
   follows:

     Wheat $2.58/bu

     Corn $1.89/bu

     Grain Sorghum $1.89/bu

     Barley $1.65/bu

     Oats $1.21/bu

   reduces the Commodity Credit Corporation interest rate on price support
   loans, and continues the no-net cost provisions of the program.
   Provides the Secretary with authority to implement allotments on
   domestic sugar production.

   Peanuts -- Improves the quota based peanut program by establishing a
   new program. The peanut program establishes payment yields, peanut
   acres, and payment acres for farms. Provides a payment of $0.18/lb.
   Establishes a support price for peanuts at $520 per ton and a loan rate
   of $400 per ton.

   Farm Savings Accounts will be available to producers of covered
   commodities, livestock, and fruit and vegetable growers. The Secretary
   shall provide a matching contribution that is equal to the amount
   deposited by the producers, up to a maximum of $10,000. Producers may
   withdraw funds from the account if the adjusted gross revenue of the
   producer falls below 90 percent of the producer's five-year average for
   adjusted gross revenue

   TITLE II -- Conservation Programs

   Environmental Quality Incentives Program -- Funding is ramped up over
   five years: FY02 $750,000,000; FY03 $1,000,000,000; FY04
   $1,350,000,000; FY05 $1,450,000,000; FY06 $1,650,000,000. Flexibility
   is increased by eliminating priority areas, waiving the prohibition on
   payments in the first year of a contract, and allowing contracts of
   three to ten years. The program is made more equitable by eliminating
   the bidding down of contracts, providing additional cost-share for
   limited resources farmers and beginning farmers, and bringing payment
   limits in line with commodities: $50,000 annually/$150,000 aggregate.
   The animal unit cap is removed with the following conditions: no
   contract stacking (one animal waste contract for life of farm bill), no
   reorganizing operations (one animal waste contract per producer). The
   bill establishes a Working Land Environmental Improvement Option to
   provide bonus payments for producers engaging in new and more
   environmentally beneficial conservation practices on working lands.
   Includes an annual payment limit of $25,000 for producers. Program is
   funded through existing EQIP funding, with an increasing limit up to
   FY02 $100,000,000; FY03 $150,000,000; FY04 $200,000,000; FY05
   $200,000,000; and, FY06 $300,000,000. The legislation also allows up to
   $100,000,000 annually for conservation innovation grants to encourage
   innovate practices to leveraging federal investment in environmental
   enhancement and protection. It waives the Section 11 cap on CCC funds
   for technical assistance.

   Conservation Reserve Program -- The authorized acreage cap is increased
   to 40 million acres. The legislation provides for a 15-year contract
   extension (with a 50 percent rate reduction) for land planted to
   hardwood trees and increase maintenance provisions from 4 to 5 years.
   Allows for 30 year contracts for Hardwood trees. It expands the
   Wetlands Pilot Program to all states. The bill gives the state FSA
   committee authority to make final determination on emergency haying and
   grazing. It also allows haying and grazing on continuous sign-up
   acreage and land in CREP to maintain buffer functions, with a reduction
   in rental rates. For small fields enrolled under the continuous sign-up
   or CREP, it provides that the entire field may be enrolled if the
   remaining portion is not feasible to farm. The legislation requires a
   study on the economic effects on rural communities resulting from the
   CRP program.

   Wetlands Reserve Program -- Increases the acreage cap by 1,250,000
   acres. Allows up to 250,000 acres to be enrolled annually.

   Farmland Protection Program -- Funding is increased over five years to
   FY02 $65,000,000; FY03 $90,000,000; FY04 $90,000,000; FY05 $90,000,000;
   FY06 $100,000,000. It clarifies ranchlands are included in the program
   and allows non-profit participation. The bill requires conservation
   plans for lands under easement. Allows in-kind contributions to count
   toward the 50 percent match.

   Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program -- Reauthorized and funding is
   increased as follows FY02 $50,000,000; FY03 $60,000,000; FY04
   $65,000,000; FY05 $75,000,000; FY06 $100,000,000.

   Grasslands Reserve Program -- Establishes a new program to preserve
   native grasslands through enrollment in 30-year and permanent
   easements. Enrollment is capped at 2 million acres. The program also
   allows for technical assistance and cost-share for restoration.

   Resource Conservation and Development Program -- The program is
   permanently authorized. Permits the Secretary to provide technical and
   financial assistance to approved RC&D run programs.

   Conservation of Private Grazing Land -- The program is made mandatory
   at $40,000,000 annually.

   Watershed Risk Reduction -- Program is authorized at $15,000,000
   annually through FY06 to provide technical assistance and purchase
   flood plain easements to safeguard lives and property from natural
   occurrences, including floods and drought.
