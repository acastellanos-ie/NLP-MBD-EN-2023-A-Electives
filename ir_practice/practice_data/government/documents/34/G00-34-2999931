                U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
                   Women's Health Time Capsule Initiative

                                   Drawing

     The Office on Women's Health (OWH) in the Department of Health and
     Human Services (HHS) is the lead office for the Women's Health Time
     Capsule initiative. Its purpose is to capture and highlight, for
     future generations, the most significant contributions/advances
     related to improvements in women's health during the past century. A
     Planning Committee met monthly to develop and implement this
     initiative. The Committee was composed of representatives from other
     HHS agencies such as the National Institutes of Health Office of
     Research on Women's Health, the Health Resources and Services
     Administration Office of Women's Health, the Substance Abuse and
     Mental Health Services Administration, and the Food and Drug
     Administration. Their efforts will culminate on December 3, 2001, in
     an OWH Tenth Anniversary celebration.

     A number of items that have had a tremendous impact on women's
     health in the past century were identified and placed into the time
     capsule. These items fall under the following categories: body image
     and health, diagnoses and treatment, legislation and policy, health
     education/communications, preventive health, quality of life, and
     social and cultural factors.
