      Activities with Foreign Governments and International Organizations
     __________________________________________________________________

Introduction

   International activities have been an active component of the U.S.
   Geological Survey (USGS) National Mapping Program (NMP) for more than
   four decades. These activities have included demonstration projects
   conducted for other countries and international organizations,
   scientific cooperation with foreign mapping agencies, exchange of
   scientists, training of foreign scientists and technicians, and
   representation of the USGS or U.S. Government in international
   organizations, commissions, and associations. The USGS conducts
   international activities in support of United States foreign objectives
   and to expand its knowledge of the mapping sciences. This knowledge
   directly benefits the National Mapping Program through advancements of
   surveying, mapping, remote sensing, and geographic information systems
   (GIS) concepts, and development of advanced field and laboratory
   techniques.

   International activities conducted by the NMP usually are at the
   request of either the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Department
   of State (DOS), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), foreign
   governments, and international organizations. Foreign activities are
   authorized by legislation and by DOS Circular 175 approved
   international agreements. Many of NMP's foreign activities are in
   support of national or international organizations such as the National
   Science Foundation (NSF) and United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).
