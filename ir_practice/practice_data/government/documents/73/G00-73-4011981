   EASI Overview

   Project EASI (Easy Access for Students and Institutions) was a joint
   effort among the Department of Education, students, educators, and the
   business community over the past several years, to document then
   current processes and redesign the student financial aid delivery
   system.

   The project has "graduated" into the Modernization Blueprint which is
   an implementation plan for the Project EASI vision.

   This web site provides historical documents about Project EASI, as well
   as the library of technical documents that Project EASI delivered
   between 1996 and 1999.
