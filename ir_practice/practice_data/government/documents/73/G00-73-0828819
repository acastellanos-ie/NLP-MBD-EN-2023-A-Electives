              Welcome to the Automated Highway System Home Page

   On behalf of the Automated Highway System (AHS) team here at the
   Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), we welcome you to our web site.
   This site contains a culmination of information from over $15M in
   research contracts awarded byFHWA. These contracts have laid the
   foundation of research for the AHS program. The site currently includes
   executive summaries from each of the 76 reports that were generated
   during the Precursor System Analysis (PSA) phase of the program. These
   reports are currently available through the National Technical
   Information Service (NTIS) and soon we will offer them all on one
   CD-ROM.

   This site has been created to assist anyone interested in AHS research
   to locate the appropriate information with a minimum of effort. We want
   to make your visit to this site a productive and efficient experience.
   Your comments and/or suggestions areencouraged.

   Happy surfing,

   The FHWA/Mitretek AHS Team
