  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:

   These instruction provided below are general and apply to all of the
   GPO Access databases. For specific information on each database, use
   the Helpful Hints and Database Contents.

   Each database use an identifier code before the title in the results
   lists to assist the user in recognizing the type of document retrieved.
   These identifiers are explained in the Helpful Hints for each database.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

  BOOLEAN OPERATORS:

    Default Operator (OR):

   The default operator for the WAIS service is OR, so a series of words
   searched without any boolean operators will be treated as if an OR had
   been inserted between each word. The relevance ranking feature will
   give a higher ranking to documents containing all of the requested
   words, but all documents contain any of the words will be retrieved.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

    Available Boolean Operators:

   The boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, and ADJ can be used to establish
   logical relationships between concepts expressed in natural language in
   a query. The boolean operators are used to narrow searches and make
   them more specific. The boolean operators must be capitalized or they
   are considered stopwords and ignored. When this occurs, the default
   operator (OR) is used. For example, a search for lyme and disease will
   be treated as if it had been entered as lyme OR disease.

   AND - The AND operator is helpful in restricting a search when a
   particular pair of terms is known. For instance, a query such as
   weather and aviation returns only those documents that contain both
   words.

   OR - The OR operator is often used to join two different phrases of a
   boolean search. A question such as "transportation OR highway" results
   in documents containing wither the word "transportation," or the word
   "highway," or both. A natural language question is much like having an
   implicit OR between the words, except that natural language does more
   work to determine the relevance of words and their relationships in
   phrases.

   NOT - The NOT operator is used to reject any documents that contain
   certain words. For instance, the query education NOT "secondary
   education" retrieves documents containing the word "education" that do
   not contain the phrase "secondary education".

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

    Searching for Phrases; Using the ADJ Operator:

   ADJ - The ADJ operator is used to ensure that one word is adjacent to
   another in the returned document. The ADJ operator retrieves not only
   documents where the words are immediately adjacent , but also those
   where one word follows the other by up to 20 characters. For example, a
   search for lead ADJ paint returns documents with the phrase "lead
   paint" and also documents with the phrase "lead-based paint", but will
   not return other documents that contains both the words "lead" and
   "paint" separately. The documents with the exact phrase "lead paint"
   will be assigned a higher relevance ranking than those with the phrase
   "lead-based paint".

   Quotation marks can be used instead of the boolean operator ADJ when
   searching for a phrase. For example, the query "Government Printing
   Office" can be used instead of Government ADJ Printing ADJ Office.
   Phrase searching using quotation marks retrieves the same results as a
   search including the boolean operator ADJ.

   Quotation marks can be used in combination with other boolean
   operators; for example, "Department of Education" AND "bilingual
   education" will retrieve documents that mention the Department of
   Education and also include the phrase "bilingual education". Stopwords
   that are included in queries are ignored, so a search for "department
   of education" will retrieve the same results as a search for
   "department education" or department ADJ education.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

    Complex Queries Using More Than One Boolean Operator:

   Complex queries can be constructed using multiple boolean operators.
   For clarity, parentheses should be used to group sections of the query
   and ensure that the WAIS server parses the query as intended; for
   example: "Department of Education" AND ("bilingual education" OR
   "foreign language") AND (grants OR "cooperative agreements"). Without
   the parentheses, the WAIS server will first process the phrases, then
   the AND operators and then the OR operators, resulting in a query that
   would read as follows: ("Department of Education" AND "bilingual
   education") OR ("foreign language" AND grants) OR "cooperative
   agreements". A test of these searches in the Federal Register database
   in June 1995, retrieved 39 documents from the first search and 399 from
   the second search. In this instance, the relevance ranking feature
   assigned the highest ranking to the same two documents from each search
   since they contain all of the requested phrases; however, it is best
   not to rely on the relevance ranking to interpret the intention of a
   query.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

    Query Report:

   Each search results list includes as the final document a Query Report.
   This document can be viewed to determine how a query was parsed, the
   speed of the retrieval, and the number of words in the database that
   conformed to the search request and the total number of relevant
   documents identified.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

  STOPWORD LIST:

   The following words make up the default stopword list used for all GPO
   Access databases, except the User Guide. Stopwords are words which
   occur so frequently that they are not useful for distinguishing one
   document from another. Since they are not useful for searching, they
   are not indexed. Stop words that are included in queries are ignored,
   so a search for "department of education" will retrieve the same
   results as a search for "department education" or department ADJ
   education.

  RELEVANCE RANKING:

   The WAIS server automatically display the results from each search
   using relevance ranking. The most relevant document will appear first
   with a rank of 1,000. Other documents will have a lower rank. Relevance
   is computed based on several factors, including the occurrence of the
   search terms in the document title, the frequency of the terms as a
   percentage of the total document size and conformance with the exact
   search phrasing.

   When searching multiple databases with the same query, the results from
   each database will be merged and ranked.

  SAMPLE SEARCHES AND SEARCH TECHNIQUES FOR THE CBD:

   The following searches will help you familiarize yourself with various
   methods of searching for information in the GPO Access databases. For
   specific information on searching other GPO Access databases, use the
   Helpful Hints.

   Each of these searches can be used in more than one database. As a
   result, the search results presented may differ slightly. These
   searches only serve to guide you when constructing search strings and
   should not restrict your searching strategies. Please note: Some
   searches may be more appropriate for one database than another. For
   example, a bill search is more useful when searching the Congressional
   Bills or Congressional Record databases than the Federal Register
   database.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   Content and file format: The Commerce Business Daily (CBD) lists
   notices of proposed government procurement actions, contract awards,
   sales of government property, and other procurement information. Each
   notice appears in the print CBD only once. Notices stay "active" in the
   CBD database online via GPO Access for 15 days and are then moved to an
   "archived" database. Each notice is available as an ASCII text file and
   HTML file. The database is updated continuously.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   Identification Code: Each CBD notice in the database will display in
   the results list with the identification code followed by the subject
   of the notice. The identification code for the Commerce Business Daily
   database is "CBD". For example: CBD: 51--SCREW THREADING SET.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   Maximum Responses: The default setting for SWAIS and the
   WinWAIS/MacWAIS client software is to return a maximum of 40 responses
   to a query. The default for the Web interface is to return a maximim of
   40 documents to a CBD query. To locate a larger number of documents,
   (maximum 350) you will need to change the setting. In SWAIS type a
   lower case o at the Source Selection menu to change your options. In
   WinWAIS, select Edit and then Preferences from the pull-down menu. In
   MacWAIS, select File and then Preferences from the pull-down menu. On
   the GPO Access Web Searching Pages a box is provided in which you may
   change the number of documents returned.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   When searching via SWAIS (dial-in or telnet session) or a WAIS client,
   a field can be searched by typing the field name, followed by an equals
   sign (=), followed by the term or terms that are sought. Similarly,
   when searching via the World Wide Web, you may type in the field name,
   followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the search term(s) sought
   or link to the ADVANCED searching pages which contain established
   fields. All queries that do not specify a field search the entire
   database.

   Sample Searches {1}

   If you perform these sample searches you may have to use the "archive
   of expired notices". This is due to the fact that notices in the CBD
   database are only "active" for 15 days. These samples are meant to
   serve as examples for creating your own searches in both the "active
   notices" and "archive of expired notices" database.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   Subject
Query:    "preventive maintenance"
Results: CBD: R- DESIGN OF PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS

   This search demonstrates how to search the CBD by subject matter.
   Because you would like the words "preventive maintenance" next to each
   other, you surround the phrase by quotation marks. No fields were
   designated in this search, therefore it is a full text search and
   searches every field for the phrase "preventive maintenance". To search
   specifically the subject field simply type in: subject= "preventive
   maintenance"

                                 [cbd2.gif]

   Cite number
Query:    cite="I-338 SN00788"
Result:   CBD: 99-DIGITAL TAPE RECORDING SYSTEM

   This search demonstrates how agencies submitting notices can search for
   a notice by cite number. The cite number is the number provided as a
   reference after an electronic submission has been accepted. It is best
   to enclose the entire cite in quotation marks and include hyphens and
   spaces.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   Solicitation number
Query:    sol="N0010498T1276"
Result:   CBD: 58--COMMUNICATION SUBSY

   When searching for a specific solicitation number in the CBD, enclose
   the entire number in quotation marks. Remember to include all dashes
   and do NOT add any spaces.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   Part and Subpart
Query:    part="contract awards" AND subpart=services
Result:   CBD: A--TURBINE ENGINE SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY (TEST)
          CBD: A - TURBINE ENGINE SYTEM TECHNOLOGY

   This search demonstrates how to restrict your search to a specific type
   of notice. In this example, you are searching only contract awards for
   services. You can choose to limit your search to any type of CBD
   notice.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   Award Number
Query:    cnt="C109-S"
Result:   CBD: T-BOOKS

   This search demonstrates how to restrict your query to a specific award
   number. Remember to enclose the award number in quotation marks, do NOT
   add spaces and remember to include hyphens.

   [TOP] [SIMPLE SEARCH] [FIELDED SEARCH]

   Restricting by date
Query:    due=12/30/97
Result:   CBD: G--VOCATIONAL COUNSELING
          CBD: 70--VIDEO CONFERENCING UNITS

   This demonstrates how to restrict your search by date. In this case you
   are searching for all notices with a response date of 12/30/97. You can
   also use greater or less signs (< or >) , as well as search for date
   ranges using the word "TO"(uppercase). Examples: due>12/30/97 or
   due=12/1/97 TO 12/30/97 The same technique can be used for the field
   award date. Example: dtd=12/02/96

   Date Posted
Query:    posted=12/29/97
Result:   CBD: 48--VALVE REGULATIONS
          CBD: Z- DREDGE MOORING BASIN, JONES BEACH

   Posted date is the date the notice was placed in the database, not the
   date the notice was printed. Notices usually appear in the printed copy
   2 business days after their posted date (as long as they were submitted
   prior to 4 pm EST.) To search by posted date, use the fielded search
   page or enter the field name posted followed by the equal (=) sign:
   posted=2/29/97.
