                               Lo`ihi Seamount
                    Hawai`i's Youngest Submarine Volcano

                      Sketch of Lo`ihi Volcano, Hawai`i

   View of Lo`ihi Seamount northwest from a perspective high above and to
   the southeast of the Island of Hawai`i (green). Lo`ihi Seamount is in
   bottom center of image.

   Lo`ihi Seamount is an active volcano built on the seafloor south of
   Kilauea about 30 km from shore. The seamount rises to 969 m below sea
   level and generates frequent earthquake swarms, the most intense of
   which occurred in 1996. An eruption at Lo`ihi has yet to be observed,
   but scientists from the University of Hawai`i have recently made many
   submersible dives to the volcano and deployed instruments on its summit
   to study Lo`ihi in much greater detail.

   The summit of Lo`ihi is marked by a caldera-like depression 2.8 km wide
   and 3.7 km long. Three collapse pits or craters occupy the southern
   part of the caldera; the most recent pit formed during an intense
   earthquake swarm in July-August 1996. Named Pele's Pit, the new crater
   is about 600 m in diameter and its bottom is 300 m below the previous
   surface! Like the volcanoes on the Island of Hawaii, Lo`ihi has grown
   from eruptions along its 31-km-long rift zone that extends northwest
   and southeast of the caldera.

   Summary of 1996 Activity
   Description of the intense earthquake swarm in July-August 1996 and the
   changes observed in Lo`ihi's summit caldera; prepared by scientists of
   the Hawai`i Center for Volcanology, School of Ocean and Earth Science
   and Technology, University of Hawai`i Manoa. More than 4,000
   earthquakes were recorded by HVO's seismic network during this swarm.

   Summary of Lo`ihi activity reported in the monthly Bulletin of the
   Global Volcanism Network, Smithsonian Institution. All information
   contained in these reports is preliminary and subject to change.

   Hawaiian Meaning
   The name Lo`ihi means "long" in Hawaiian and was introduced in 1955 to
   describe the elongate shape of the seamount.

   Height Above Sea Floor
   Lo`ihi is built on the seafloor that slopes about 5 degrees beneath the
   seamount. Lo`ihi's northern base is 1,900 m below sea level, whereas
   its southern base is 4,755 m below sea level. Thus, the summit is about
   931 m above the seafloor as measured from the base of its north flank
   and 3,786 m above the seafloor as measured from the base of its south
   flank.
