                          INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

   [overpass.jpg]

   The urban centers of our Nation are the focal points of economic,
   social, and political activity and our country can be severely affected
   when natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, storms, and
   volcanic eruptions strike one of these large cities. We have not seen a
   large earthquake in an urban setting since the devasting 1906 San
   Francisco earthquake, but the Loma Prieta earthquake (M6.9) on October
   17, 1989, and most recently the earthquake of January 17, 1994 in
   Northridge, California (M6.7) have shown that even moderate events can
   cause great damage ($20-40 billion in Northridge) and loss of life (57
   deaths in Northridge). Following the Northridge earthquake, the USGS
   has utilized National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP)
   funding to pursue post-earthquake investigations designed to understand
   the damaging effects of the earthquake, as described in USGS Response
   to an Urban Earthquake: Northridge '94. This website summarizes the
   results of many of those studies and makes available several
   publications and data sets that haave resulted from the research.

   As a consequence of the Northridge research, the U.S. Geological Survey
   created and used large digital geospatial data sets (that is, data
   referenced to the geographic coordinate system) in the preparation of
   cartographic maps and illustration products. This website provides a
   comprehensive linkage to those geospatial data and to associated
   publications in which the data are described or were otherwise employed
   in maps and illustrations. Currently, there is no centralized
   repository designated for the USGS Northridge data sets or
   publications. The data sets reside on various ftp servers and websites.

       necessary for the conduct of the USGS scientific studies
     * PUBLICATIONS--Books, maps, reports, CD-ROMs, and online
       publications resulting from the USGS scientific studies
