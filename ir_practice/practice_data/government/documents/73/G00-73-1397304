   FD 30

        The Mission Design Group is responsible for development and analysis of
        the on-orbit schedules of payload activities for complex space programs
        such as International Space Station. This task involves planning,
        scheduling and integrating all payload activity requirements within
        flight vehicle resource capabilities and constraints. During on-orbit
        schedule development each payload is assigned performance timeslots or
        windows during which it can receive required resources such as
        electrical power, crew time, communication coverage and computer
        support for operation.

        The Mission Design Group is composed of personnel with a variety of
        engineering and technical degrees who develop and implement planning
        processes for on-orbit schedule development during pre-flight
        preparations and for timeline changes during actual flight operations.
        Mission Design personnel develop requirements for new software
        capabilities to enhance and expedite the performance of these tasks,
        and evaluate planning software and techniques.
