  APPLICABILITY OF LOCAL RULES

   1001-1. General.

   These Local Bankruptcy Rules are adopted pursuant to Rule 9029 of the
   Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, to govern the local practice and
   procedures before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
   District of Illinois.

   These rules shall be cited as "S.D. Ill. LBR _ _ _ _ - _ "
   (Example:"S.D. Ill. LBR 1001-1") and shall be construed in a manner
   consistent with the Bankruptcy Code and the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
   Procedure. These rules may be amended or supplemented, from time to
   time, by additional orders as the Court deems necessary.

   1001-2. Local Rules of the United States District Court.

   Except as otherwise ordered, the Local Rules of the United States
   District Court for the Southern District of Illinois are hereby adopted
   and incorporated herein and shall apply to proceedings in the United
   States Bankruptcy Court.

  PART I.

   COMMENCEMENT OF CASE; PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO PETITION AND ORDER FOR
   RELIEF
   1002-1. Commencement of Case.

   The minimum number of copies of the petition, statements, schedules and
   lists required by this Court are as follows:
   (OF# = Official Bankruptcy Form Number)
   (O = Signed Original)

   CHAPTER                 7   11  12  13
   Petition (OF#l)         O+3 O+6 O+3 O+3

   Matrix                  O   O   O   O
   Verification of Matrix  O   O   O   O

   1002-2. Matrix.

   A matrix listing the complete name, address and zip code of each
   creditor shall be filed with the initial schedule of liabilities, and
   shall be used for scanning the creditors into the computer. The correct
   procedure for the preparation of a matrix is shown in Appendix 1 to
   these rules. The debtors should also verify that the matrix includes
   all creditors listed on the schedules and submit an appropriate
   verification similar to the one shown in Appendix l(a).

   When amending schedules to add a creditor(s), a matrix showing only the
   creditors added shall be submitted with the Amended Schedules.

   Documents which fail to comply with the provisions of this rule shall
   be accepted for filing, but are subject to being stricken by order of
   the Court.

   1007-1. Voluntary Case.

   When a debtor fails to timely file the appropriate schedules and
   statements in accordance with Rule 1007(c) of the Federal Rules of
   Bankruptcy Procedure, the Court may dismiss the case without further
   notice, except in a Chapter 7 proceeding, in which case the Clerk shall
   notify the United States Trustee of this deficiency for appropriate
   action in accordance with 11 U.S.C. §707(a)(3).

   1007-2. Involuntary Case.

   The burden to prosecute an involuntary petition rests with the
   petitioning creditors. Although the burden of filing a schedule of
   liabilities rests with the debtor under Rule 1007 of the Federal Rules
   of Bankruptcy Procedure, the petitioning creditors shall take such
   action as may be necessary to ensure that appropriate statements and
   schedules are filed by the debtor. The Court may dismiss an involuntary
   petition for want of prosecution should the petitioning creditors fail
   to monitor the debtor's compliance with the requirements to file
   appropriate statements and schedules.

   1009-1. Amendments of Voluntary Petitions, Lists, Schedules and
   Statements.

   The debtor shall forthwith file a signed copy of any amendment to
   petitions, lists, schedules, and statements, together with a
   certificate of service.

  PART II.

  OFFICERS AND ADMINISTRATION; NOTICES; MEETINGS; EXAMINATIONS; ELECTIONS;
  ATTORNEYS AND ACCOUNTANTS

   2002-1. Noticing by Proponent.

   The proponent of the following matters will serve the notice required
   by Rule 2002 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and, shall
   forthwith file a signed copy of the notice with a verified certificate
   of service.

     * A. A proposed use, sale, or lease of property of the estate other
     than in the ordinary course of business.

     * B. The time fixed to accept or reject a proposed modification of a
     Chapter 12 or Chapter 13 Plan. A motion to allow temporary
     cessation/abatement of loan payments to the Trustee is considered a
     modification of a plan and shall be noticed accordingly.

     C. An application for compensation or reimbursement of expenses
     totaling in excess of $500.

     D. A motion to compromise or settle a controversy, other than
     approval of an agreement pursuant to Rule 4001(d) of the Federal
     Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.

     * Absent an objection, there will be no Court involvement with
     respect to this matter.

   2002-2. Notices to the United States and its Various Agencies.

   Whenever these rules or the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure
   require that notice be sent to the United States and its various
   agencies, the notice shall be addressed as indicated in Appendix 2 to
   these rules.

   2002-3. Certificate of Service.

   A certificate of service shall contain the full name and address of the
   persons/entities served, or, if applicable, the certificate of service
   may state that "all creditors listed on the matrix have been served."

   2003-1. Requests to Reschedule 341 Meetings.

   All requests to continue or reschedule 341 Meetings must first be
   directed to the United States Trustee in Chapter 11 Cases and to the
   assigned Trustee or Interim Trustee, as appropriate, in Chapters 7,12
   and 13. Upon agreement between the proponent of the continuance and the
   appropriate Trustee/Interim Trustee, it is the responsibility of the
   proponent to immediately serve notice to all creditors and parties in
   interest, including the Court, of the new date, time and place of the
   rescheduled 341 Meeting. The proponent is to file a certificate of
   service with the Court's copy of the notice.

   2003-2. Requests to Reschedule 341 Meetings Within Five (5) Days of
   Meeting.

   Any request by the debtor to reschedule a 341 Meeting within five (5)
   days of the scheduled meeting will require either the debtor or his/her
   attorney to appear at the scheduled meeting to request that the meeting
   be rescheduled. If the appropriate Trustee/Interim Trustee consents to
   the rescheduling and announces at the regularly scheduled 341 Meeting
   the new 341 Meeting date, no further notice to the creditors and
   parties in interest is required, except that the appropriate
   Trustee/Interim Trustee shall advise the Court of the rescheduled
   hearing date, time and place.

   2003-3. Disputes.

   Prior to filing a motion which seeks a continuance of a 341 Meeting or
   which requests that a joint debtor be excused from a 341 Meeting, the
   movant shall seek such relief from the Trustee/Interim Trustee. Failure
   to do so may result in the denial of the motion by the Court.

   2003-4. Record of Meeting.

   The United States Trustee, assigned Trustee/Interim Trustee, or in any
   event, the presiding officer at the 341 Meeting, shall forward the
   following to the Court within two (2) days following the 341 Meeting:

     A. A copy of the 341 Calendar with appropriate notations (if any).

     B. A copy of the 341 Meeting Notes prepared for each case listed on
     the Calendar mentioned above.

   2004-1. Examination.

   Upon agreement of the parties, the movant shall schedule the date, time
   and meeting place for the examination, which shall be held within
   thirty (30) days of the date of the order allowing the examination. If
   the parties cannot agree upon a date and place, the movant shall
   petition the Court to set the date, time and place of examination.

   2015-1. Chapter 7 Trustee Duties.

   The Trustee shall submit the following reports to the Court:

     A. A First Report within sixty (60) days of the 341 Meeting of
     Creditors if a "No Asset Report" has not been filed.

     B. An Interim Report every six (6) months subsequent to the First
     Report (a copy of the semi-annual report to the U.S. Trustee will
     suffice) unless a Final Distribution has been filed and approved by
     the Court.

     C. In all dismissed cases, a Report of Receipts and Disbursements,
     or, if applicable, a Report of No Receipts and Disbursements, within
     ten (10) days of dismissal.

     D. A report of sale within five (5) days of sale stating property
     sold, to whom sold and the dollar amount for which the property was
     sold. An auctioneer's report may be substituted for the foregoing.

   2016-1. Compensation for Services Rendered and Reimbursement of
   Expenses.

   An application for professional services must comply with this Court's
   decision in In re Wiedau, Inc., 78 B.R. 904 (Bankr. S.D. Ill. 1987).

   2016-2. Notice of Potential Conflict of Interest.

   Any time any portion of the attorney's fees and/or expenses of filing
   and/or pursuing a Chapter 11, 12 or 13 proceeding are provided in whole
   or in part by a creditor of the debtor or insider of the debtor, such
   information shall be disclosed by the debtor to all creditors by a
   separate written notice, a copy of which shall be filed with the Court,
   together with a certificate of service. It shall be the responsibility
   of the attorney for the debtor in every case to inquire of the debtor
   whether there have been any contributions by creditors to the debtor
   for attorney's fees and/or expenses incurred by the debtor in filing
   and/or pursuing any Chapter 11, 12 or 13 proceeding.
