                          MSHA Library Search Examples

   There are two main categories of searches; simple and complex. A simple
   search is performed on a single field. A complex search is performed on
   more than one field.

   Note:
     * The asterisk (*) stands for a wildcard. A wildcard is a symbol that
       takes the place of missing letters. You would use a wildcard (*) if
       you did not know the exact spelling of a word, or if you wanted to
       include all words that began with the letters before the wildcard.
       For instance, the search term 'MIN*' would return all words that
       began with 'MIN' in that field. ( i.e., 'MINING', 'MINUTE', 'MINT',
       etc.)
       A wildcard must follow the known letters. (i.e., MIN*, not *IN)

     * The comma (,) is used in simple searches using multiple terms. It
       acts the same as the 'OR' operator. When you enter 'MINE' , 'LUNG'
       without spaces, the search results will include all documents which
       contain the word 'mine' OR the word 'lung' in that field.

     * The ampersand (&) is used in simple searches using multiple terms.
       It acts the same as the 'AND' operator. When you enter 'MINE' &
       'LUNG' without spaces, the search results will include all
       documents which contain the word 'mine' AND the word 'lung' in that
       field.

     * Do not enter spaces between search terms.

     * Here are examples of both types of searches:
