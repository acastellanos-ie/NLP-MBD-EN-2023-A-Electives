                            RESOURCES FOR PARENTS

   EXPEDITED SERVICES was created by the office of the Clerk of Superior
   Court to assist parents and grandparents involved in a dispute over
   Court-ordered access to children.

   Trained professionals are committed to helping parents find
   constructive ways to resolve disputes regarding Court-ordered access,
   so that children may grow up in a healthier climate, and increase their
   chances to succeed.

   Relatively few circumstances justify denial of access to the
   non-custodial parent. However, the Court recognizes that in some cases,
   there are legitimate reasons to issue specific orders that may include
   supervised exchange of the child, supervised access, counseling,
   education, or substance abuse testing and monitoring.

   Parties with Maricopa County Court-ordered access may file the
   Expedited Process Request to Enforce Parent-Child Access. Parents may
   pursue enforcement either on their own, or through an attorney. If a
   party objects to the outcome of the Expedited Services conference, an
   objection and petition for a Court hearing may be filed.

   CONCILIATION SERVICES was established to provide conciliation
   counseling, mediation, and child custody evaluations. Mediation service
   is available to help parents create or modify a parenting plan. These
   plans are designed to lessen confusion for the child by resolving when
   the child will spend time with each parent. As the needs of the child
   change, as will the parents life circumstances, parents can agree to
   renegotiate the parenting plan, either on their own, or with the help
   of a professional mediator.

   The PARENTAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION class was created especially for
   parties in persistent high conflict and for parents who are
   non-compliant with the Courts orders regarding access. The four-hour
   class, conducted each Friday, is designed to provide parents with vital
   information about childrens needs and feelings when the parents
   separate and how parental behavior can either help or hurt the
   children. Although judicial officers may order parties to attend,
   attorneys may also recommend that their clients participate in the
   class. Classes are held at 201 West Jefferson Street, Phoenix, in the
   Central Court Building. Call 602-506-1448 for information.
