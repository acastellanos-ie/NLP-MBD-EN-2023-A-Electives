             Hacker Indicted for Attacks on San Diego Auto Site


   United States Attorney Patrick K. O'Toole announced today that Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents arrested Stephen L. Suplita, III,
      in Connecticut for crimes committed in Fallbrook, California. On
   December 14, 2001, a federal grand jury, sitting in San Diego, returned
   an indictment charging Mr. Suplita with committing computer crimes. The
        indictment alleges that Mr. Suplita used his computer to gain
    unauthorized access to Enjoya.com Incorporated's computer system. The
   indictment further alleges that Mr. Suplita intentionally caused damage
                           to the computer system.

       Mr. O'Toole stated that this indictment reflects the continuing
    commitment of the FBI and United States Attorney's Office to protect
    the Internet by identifying, locating and prosecuting individuals who
   use computers and the Internet to vandalize computer systems and alter
                               computer data.

   Mr. Suplita was arrested in Connecticut where he is living and working.
     Mr. Suplita is expected to make his first appearance in San Diego,
   California on January 7, 2002, at 10:30 a.m., before the Honorable Nita
   L. Stormes, United States Magistrate Judge. The case has been assigned
   to the Honorable Jeffrey T. Miller, United States District Court Judge.

                             SUMMARY OF CHARGES

   Title 18, United States Code, ยง 1030(a)(5)(A) - Intentionally Damaging

                            INVESTIGATING AGENCY

                       Federal Bureau of Investigation

    An indictment, itself, is not evidence that the defendants committed
   the crimes charged and like all defendants, they are presumed innocent
   until the Government meets its burden in court of proving guilt beyond
                             a reasonable doubt.

                                     ###
