   How Does Your Building's Energy Use Compare?

   How does your building's energy use compare to that of other buildings?
   Arch provides a simple way to see how your building's energy use
   compares to similar buildings. Currently you may search for buildings
   in of eighteen activity categories and with similar floor area.

   If you have not assembled all the requested information, you may leave
   any of the fields blank, except for building activity. Note that
   providing more information will narrow the buildings in the comparison
   to those more closely matching your building.

   Step One:

   What is the principal activity of your building?
   [Office Building______________]

   Step Two:

   Enter the first three digits of the zipcode your building is located
   in. _____
   Entering your zip code will restrict the results to buildings within
   the same US Census Division.

   Step Three:

   Enter the building's floor area. _______ (gross square feet)
   Buildings are considered to have comparable floor areas if they have
   between half and twice your area; if the area field is blank, no
   filtering is done on floor area.

   Step Four:

   Enter the annual energy consumption based on the utility bills for your
   building for each of the following fuels:

   Fuel        Energy Consumption
   Electricity 0______ [kWh/year]
   Natural Gas 0______ [therms/year_____]
   Other       0______ Million Btu/year

   Step Five:

   Building energy use can be reported as the actual energy used on site,
   or as the energy used at the energy source (about 2/3 of the "primary
   energy" that goes into an electric power plant is lost in the process
   as waste heat).   Source energy corresponds more closely to energy
   costs than does site energy.
   Select which you want to use: (*) Site    ( ) Source

   Step Six:

   Data entered on this website is saved and may later be added to our
   database.
