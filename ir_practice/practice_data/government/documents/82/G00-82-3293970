   Radioactive Waste

   Regulated Waste

        * Low-Level Waste (LLW) - includes radioactively contaminated
          protective clothing, tools, filters, rags, medical tubes, and many
          other items
        * High-Level Waste (HLW)- "irradiated" or used nuclear reactor fuel
        * Uranium Mill Tailings - the residues remaining after the processing
          of natural ore to extract uranium and thorium

      NRC does not regulate all sources of radioactivity; see Who Regulates
      Radioactive Materials and Radiation Exposure for details.

   Regulated Activities

      For general information, see the How We Regulate page. For details, see
      the following:
        * Low-Level Waste Disposal
        * High-Level Waste Disposal
        * Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel
        * Transportation of Spent Nuclear Fuel

      Regulation of some activities associated with radioactive waste is
      covered under either the Nuclear Materials or Nuclear Reactor
      regulatory programs. For example, regulation of uranium mill waste is
      covered under the Nuclear Materials Program. (See Uranium Milling under
      Fuel Cycle Facilities).

   Responsibilities

      The Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards has overall
      responsibility for NRCÂ’s radioactive waste regulation program and NRC's
      Regional Offices ( Region I - Northeast, Region II - Southeast, Region
      III - Midwest, and Region IV - West/Southwest) implement these programs
      in the states for which they are responsible. Regulation of low-level
      waste disposal is regulated by both the NRC and Agreement States. Waste
      regulation is also supported by a Radioactive Waste Research program
      and by independent advice from the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste.
