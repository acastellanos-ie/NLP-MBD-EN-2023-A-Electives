   Comments? Joshua Lederberg (b. 1925) is an American geneticist and
   microbiologist who received the Nobel prize in 1958 for his work in
   bacterial genetics. The National Library of Medicine is the repository
   for the Joshua Lederberg Papers, which range from 1910 to the 1990s,
   the majority dating from 1945 to the present day. The Joshua Lederberg
   Papers contain laboratory notebooks, research reports, published
   articles and books, correspondence, unpublished manuscripts, speeches,
   news clippings, photographic prints, and audiovisual materials.

   As part of its Profiles in ScienceÂ® project, the National Library of
   Medicine is digitizing and making available over the World Wide Web
   major portions of the Joshua Lederberg Papers, for use by educators and
   researchers. This Web site provides access to the portions of the
   Joshua Lederberg Papers now publicly available. We suggest that new
   visitors begin with the online Exhibit, which contains the majority of
   these documents and visuals. The Exhibit provides biographical
   information and short essays on Dr. Lederberg's work, and these lead to
   the digitized documents and visuals.

   In addition to the Exhibit, visitors may access the publicly available
   materials through Alphabetical or Chronological Listings. Documents and
   visuals in these lists are arranged by format and then either
   alphabetically by title or chronologically by date. A third way of
   accessing the publicly available materials is through a Search Engine,
   which searches for a text string in either the OCR of the scanned image
   or in the metadata, that is, information that the library has entered
   about each item in the full digital collection.

   As the Joshua Lederberg Papers continue to be digitized, they will be
   added to this Web site and made available to the public.
