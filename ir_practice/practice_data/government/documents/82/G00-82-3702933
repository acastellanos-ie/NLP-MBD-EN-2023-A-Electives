   LAR CRIME

            FBI Louisville's White-Collar Crime Program is responsible for
   investigating federal crimes relating to fraud, theft, or embezzlement
   occurring within or against the national or international financial
   community, as well as instances of public corruption. These crimes are
   categorized by deceit, concealment or violation of trust, and are not
   dependent upon the application or threat of physical force or violence.
   Such acts are committed by individuals and organizations to obtain
   money, property, or services; to avoid the payment or loss of money or
   services; or to secure personal or business advantage. FBI financial
   crimes investigations target such criminal activities as money
   laundering, health care fraud, theft of intellectual property rights,
   bankruptcy fraud, insurance and securities fraud, telemarketing fraud,
   computer fraud, financial institution fraud, fraud against the
   government, and environmental crimes.

                            The more common types of fraudulent practices
   include:

                                      advance fee schemes;
                                      health insurance frauds;
                                      impersonation frauds;
                                      Internet frauds;
                                      letter of credit frauds;
                                      Prime Bank Note frauds;
                                      "Ponzi" schemes; and,
                                      pyramid schemes.
