   Washington's Energy Strategy

      In 1991, the Legislature instructed the Governor to appoint a group of
      20 citizens, representatives of business and industry, and public
      officials to recommend a strategy that would work toward assuring
      Washington residents of adequate, economical, and reliable energy while
      protecting the environment and promoting economic development.
      Washington's Energy Strategy is the result of the Committee's work.

      In 1994, the Legislature enacted ESB 6493, which made Washington's
      Energy Strategy the primary guidance for implementation of the state's
      energy policy. The legislation also provides for a public process to
      update the Strategy as needed.

      Also in 1994, Gov. Lowry signed an Executive Order implementing the
      Washington Energy Strategy. The Executive Order:
        * Determined that the Washington Energy Strategy shall be the policy
          framework for energy decisions made by state agencies.
        * Named the Washington State Energy Office, now the Department of
          Community, Trade and Economic Development, as the lead agency for
          implementing the Washington Energy Strategy.
        * Directed the Energy Office to convene an interagency working group
          to ensure efficient coordination and pursue implementation of the
          most promising policy alternatives in the Strategy.
