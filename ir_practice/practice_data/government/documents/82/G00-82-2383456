   Samuel W. Bodman is the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Commerce.
   A financier and executive by trade, he is well suited to his role of
   managing the day-to-day operations of the cabinet agency with 40,000
   employees and a $5 billion budget. An engineer by training, he is well
   qualified for his specific oversight focus on the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration, the Patent and Trademark Office, and the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology.

   With 31 years' experience in the private sector, Deputy Secretary
   Bodman is a firm believer in the American free enterprise system. His
   work in the finance industry began when he was professor at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) and started consulting
   with the venture capital sector. He and his partners and associates
   provided financial and managerial support to scores of new business
   enterprises located throughout the United States. Virtually all of
   these companies had strong dependence on technology and innovation.
   Many of these achieved great financial success and established public
   markets for their securities.

   Born in 1938 in Chicago, he graduated in 1961 with a B.S. in chemical
   engineering from Cornell University. In 1965, he completed his ScD at
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For the next six years he served
   as an Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and as
   Technical Director of the American Research and Development
   Corporation, a pioneer venture capital firm.

   From there, Deputy Secretary Bodman went to Fidelity Venture
   Associates, a division of the Fidelity Investments. In 1983 he was
   named President and Chief Operating Officer of Fidelity Investments and
   a Director of the Fidelity Group of Mutual Funds. In 1988, he joined
   Cabot Corporation, a Boston-based Fortune 300 company with global
   business activities in specialty chemicals and materials, where he
   served as Chairman, CEO, and a Director. Over the years, he has been a
   Director of many other publicly owned corporations.

   Deputy Secretary Bodman has also been active in public service. He is a
   former Director of M.I.T.'s School of Engineering Practice and a former
   member of the M.I.T. Commission on Education. He also served as a
   member of the Executive and Investment Committees at M.I.T., a member
   of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and a Trustee of the
   Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the New England Aquarium.

   Deputy Secretary Bodman is married to M. Diane Bodman. He has three
   children, two stepchildren, and seven grandchildren. He and his wife
   reside in Washington, D.C.
