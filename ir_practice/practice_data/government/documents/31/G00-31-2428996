                           About the Helix Systems

   As the centralized resource for high performance scientific computing
   in the Center for Information Technology, the Helix Systems provides a
   wide variety of services to the NIH scientific community.
     * General Purpose Scientific Computing Resources
       These service include:
          + helix.nih.gov a multiuser/multipurpose shared system (SGI
            ORIGIN 2400) containing a wide variety of scientific software.
          + Web servers ( molbio.info.nih.gov, seqweb.nih.gov) providing
            access to Web-bases applications.
          + In collaboration with the NIH Library, Helix Systems maintains
            the literature search services Web of Science and the
            literature alter service Porpoise
          + Helix Sytems maintains the Directory and Email Forwarding
            Service
          + To enhance access to the Helix Systems compute platforms a
            NIH-wide site license for PC and Mac X-Windows software has
            been established.
     * High Performance Scientific Computing Resources
       In support of those scientist requiring true high performance
       computing the Helix Systems maintain a number of multiprocessor
       shared memory SMP (symmetrical multiprocessor) computers
       (galaxy.nih.gov, quasar.nih.gov) as well as a Beowulf-class cluster
       (biowulf.nih.gov). The later contains more than 400 Pentium III
       class processors in a distributed memory environment. Multiple
       systems allow different high performance computer architectures to
       be matched to the applications and programming styles for which
       they are best suited.
     * Email
       Electronic mail can be sent and received from helix.nih.gov
     * Training
     * User Suppport
