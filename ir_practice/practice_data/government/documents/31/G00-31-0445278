   The Office of Family Assistance (OFA) is located in the United States
   Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children
   and Families and oversees the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
   (TANF) Program which was created by the Welfare Reform Law of 1996.
   TANF became effective July 1, 1997, and replaced what was then commonly
   known as welfare: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and
   the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) programs.

    Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) provides assistance and
   work opportunities to needy families by granting states the federal
   funds and wide flexibility to develop and implement their own welfare
   programs.

    TANF Essentials:
     * Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of
       1996 (PRWORA)
     * TANF Annual Report to Congress

   What is Charitable Choice? [new2.gif]
     * Charitable Choice is a legislative provision designed to remove
       unnecessary barriers to the receipt of certain federal funds by
       faith-based organizations. The provision prohibits states from
       discriminating against religious organizations when choosing
       providers under certain federal grant programs, as long as the
       programs are implemented in a manner that is consistent with
       the First Amendment. While Charitable Choice is designed to improve
       access to federal funding for faith-based organizations, it does
       not establish a new funding stream dedicated to these groups.
       To read more about faith-based and community initiatives, visit the
       HHS Center for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives

   The Welfare Peer Technical Assistance Network provides guidance and
   instruction to states on promising practices for moving welfare and
   low-income families to self-sufficiency. In addition, the Network
   provides information to states about TANF program resources and
   increases communication among the states about promising practices.
