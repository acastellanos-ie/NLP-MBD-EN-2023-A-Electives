                                    History

   The Visualization Group was created in 1990 (it was then called the
   Graphics Group) when Wes Bethel was hired to work under Nancy Johnston
   to tame, explore and apply to ongoing scientific programs some brand
   new software (AVS) which was running on some brand new hardware (the
   Ardent Titan, a multiprocessor graphics machine which is remarkably
   similar in architecture to the modern-day Onyx..). Prior to this point,
   all of the graphics work done at the lab was accomplished via making
   call from within code to subroutine libraries, or using graphics
   "packages" such as gnuplot. This step marked the lab's first foray into
   interactive 3d visualization which was supported by some serious
   graphics hardware.

   The initial success of the graphics program was due in part to the
   diligence of the researchers involved. They were a tough, tenacious
   bunch who really wanted this kind of capability, and were willing to
   work very closely with us. The jointly-developed visualizations helped
   push the envelope of some scientific programs. For example, using 3d
   visualization, researchers in Earth Science were able to verify the
   existance of a deep subduction zone near New Hebrides. One of our
   awards was given for a compelling visualization from a hydrological
   study used in modelling nuclear waste storage facilities in Sweden. The
   theme throughout all of our activities is the symbiotic and synergystic
   relationship between the visualization technology and the scientific
   research program.

   Over time our work has begun to branch out to include more research and
   development. For example, we created the VR Library, which is a suite
   of AVS modules designed to allow users to easily incorporate VR input
   devices into the user interface of a visualization network. Another
   large project has been our input to the Khoros system, which is similar
   in some ways to AVS. However, as our interests and workload have
   increased, we have also expanded our staff, so our commitment to
   collaborating with users on visualization projects has not changed.

                       What is Scientific Visualization?

   The goal of scientific visualization is to help scientists view and
   better understand their data. This data can come from experiments or
   numerical simulations. Often the size and complexity of the data makes
   it difficult to understand by direct inspection. Also, the data may be
   generated at several times during an experiment or simulation and
   understanding how the data varies with time may be difficult.

   Scientific visualization can help with these difficulties by
   representing the data so that it may be viewed in its entirety. In the
   case of time varying data, animations can be created that show this
   variation in a natural way. Using virtual reality techniques, the data
   can be viewed and manipulated naturally in a true three dimensional
   environment (e.g. depth is explicitly perceived and not just implied).

   All these techniques can allow scientists to better understand their
   data. Viewing the data in this way can quickly draw the scientist's
   attention to interesting and/or anomalous portions of the data. Because
   of this, we encourage scientists to use scientific visualization from
   the beginning of their experiments and simulations and not just when
   they think they have everything operating correctly. This also allows
   the scientists to develop a set of visualization tools and techniques
   that will help them understand their data as their research matures.

                                 What Do We Do?

   Our mission is to assist researchers in achieving their scientific
   goals more quickly through visualization while simultaneously advancing
   the state-of-the-art in visualization through our own research. From
   the standpoint of a user of NERSC, for example, the Visualization Group
   provides the expertise and the software and hardware resources
   necessary to allow that user to visualize his or her data without
   having to invest the significant amount of time required to learn about
   visualization tools and techniques. We also make our software and
   hardware resources available to more experienced or adventurous users
   to allow them to explore their data at their own pace.

Facilities and Hardware

   Over the years, the Visualization Group has installed a variety of
   equipment to enhance the researcher's ability to make discoveries using
   3d visualization. Our pride and joy is the visualization lab, in
   50B-1232 and 50B-1232A. This lab, which came on-line in May '96,
   contains our most sophisticated graphics hardware and display
   technology. The lab's 6'x8' rear projection screen and SGI Onyx
   workstation provide high resolution, high speed 3D graphical output for
   our visualization applications. The lab also contains a Dec Alpha
   workstation, which provides additional graphics horsepower. Both of
   these machines are capable of displaying in stereo. For more
   information on the visualization lab and our other hardware please see
   the Hardware Page.

Software Services

   We provide a large quantity of software tools for visualization and
   other graphics tasks. The main visualization workhorses are AVS and
   Khoros, both of which include a visual programming language that makes
   it easy to build visualization "programs" from standard or customized
   building blocks ("modules"). We have done a lot of work in extending
   these packages by writing custom modules that suit a researcher's
   specific needs, and by doing so we have usually been able to match the
   computer's output with the researcher's vision.

   We also provide a large number of other graphics libraries and
   applications such as NCAR, gnuplot, imtools, etc. These are described
   in great detail on the Software Page.
