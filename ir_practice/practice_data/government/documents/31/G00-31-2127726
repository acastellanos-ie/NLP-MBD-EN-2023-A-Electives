   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA : MDL NO.
   1355 : IN RE: PROPULSID : SECTION: L PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATION ::
   JUDGE FALLON : MAG. JUDGE AFRICK THIS DOCUMENT RELATES TO ALL CASES :
   .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
   .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. PRETRIAL ORDER NO. 14 (State-Federal
   Coordination) The Court has been informed that an Agreement has been
   reached between and among the plaintiffs in this action, numerous
   plaintiffs in state court actions and the defendants respecting matters
   which are the subject of defendants' pending Motion For Injunction. A
   copy of that Agreement is attached. The court acknowledges that issues
   may arise under Section K(2)(d) of Pre-Trial Order No. 7, which is a
   part of the Agreement that may require consultation with some state
   courts. For good cause shown, it is on this 30th day of November 2001.
   ORDERED that the defendants' Motion For Injunction is withdrawn without
   prejudice and may be renewed pursuant to Section 7 of the Agreement;
   and it is further ORDERED that, in the event disputes arise under
   Section K(2)(d) of Pre-Trial Order No. 7, which the parties are unable
   to resolve among themselves and which are presented to this Court for
   resolution, either during or after the conduct of a deposition, this
   Court will consult, to the extent necessary and practicable, with the
   state court Judge or Judges who have jurisdiction over the cases in
   which the objection arises in an effort to provide a resolution
   satisfactory to both courts. It shall be the obligation of counsel who
   seeks judicial intervention under Section K(2)(d) to provide the name,
   address and telephone number of the state court Judge. Except to the
   extent jurisdiction already exists, if any, this Order shall not confer
   jurisdiction upon any claimant or counsel to MDL No. 1355. BY THE
   COURT: Dated: November 30, 2001 /s/ Eldon E. Fallon JUDGE ELDON E.
   FALLON UNITED STATE DISTRICT JUDGE AGREEMENT The parties to this
   Agreement are counsel to parties in various state and federal court
   actions against Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc. and Johnson & Johnson
   (hereinafter "defendants") involving the product Propulsid®. They wish
   to resolve certain differences between and among them respecting
   pretrial matters in those cases, both those which are presently on file
   and those Propulsid® cases which counsel will hereafter file in state
   or federal courts. All counsel represent that they have the authority
   to enter into this Agreement. In consideration of the mutual promises
   contained herein the parties agree as follows: 1. Counsel for the
   plaintiffs who sign this Agreement shall appoint a Coordination
   Committee which shall have the authority to speak for and bind all such
   signatories to the administration of this Agreement. The composition
   and management of this Committee shall be the exclusive right and
   obligation of plaintiffs' counsel who sign this Agreement. 2. The
   plaintiffs agree that the depositions which shall be taken by them of
   past and present employees of the defendants in all their present and
   future cases involving Propulsid® shall be coordinated by plaintiffs'
   counsel as follows: (a) one plaintiffs' attorney shall be designated as
   lead counsel for each deposition; (b) when lead counsel has completed
   his or her deposition of the witness, any other plaintiffs' counsel who
   wishes to question the witness shall limit his or her questions to
   discoverable matters not covered by lead counsel; (c) the depositions
   shall be noticed and conducted in accordance with Pretrial Order No. 7
   entered on December 7, 2000 by the United States District Court for the
   Eastern District of Louisiana in MDL No. 1355 (this Order shall be
   subject to any modifications which the plaintiffs and defendants may
   agree to in writing); (d) the deposition of the witness shall only be
   taken once for use in all state and federal court cases subject only to
   the Supplemental Depositions provisions of the December 7, 2000 Order;
   and (e) depositions taken pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as
   if they had been taken pursuant to the rules and law of the particular
   jurisdiction in which their use is sought as to relevancy, materiality
   and competency, and where state law supplies the rule of decision, the
   privilege of a witness or party shall be determined in accordance with
   state law. 3. The depositions of defendants' past or present employees
   shall commence in December 2001. 4. The defendants shall, to the extent
   they have not yet done so, provide the Coordination Committee, in both
   electronic and hard copy, copies of the transcripts of depositions
   already taken of defendants' past and present employees, and of expert
   witnesses and third parties (but not to include depositions of
   plaintiffs, their employers and their health care providers, although
   there shall be posted on the MDL Verilaw system a notice that such
   depositions have been taken and who is the custodian, who shall be
   identified by name, firm, address, both physical and e-mail, telephone
   and fax number), whether in state court or federal court, together with
   the exhibits marked at those depositions and copies of the document
   production the defendants have already made. This production has
   essentially been made in the form of several hundred CD's which contain
   more than 4,000,000 pages of documents from defendants together with
   copies of certain videos and electronic data. Sufficient copies of
   non-electronic materials shall be provided in sufficient numbers for
   members of the Coordination Committee. The defendants shall provide the
   Coordination Committee all future document production. Depositions
   taken pursuant to this Agreement, as well as depositions of experts and
   third parties, shall be placed on the MDL Verilaw system which is part
   of the MDL Court's case management system. The defendants shall arrange
   posting of depositions taken to date on the MDL Verilaw system; as to
   depositions taken after the date of this Agreement, the deposition
   shall be posted by the party taking the deposition. The Coordination
   Committee shall arrange to distribute among its members, as may be
   requested, copies of future depositions to be taken of defendants' past
   and present employees. 5. This Agreement shall be appended to a
   proposed Consent Order or a Stipulation which shall be signed by
   counsel for the respective parties and filed in all present and future
   state court actions. It shall bind the parties' conduct of depositions
   of the defendants in those actions. 6. The parties shall endeavor to
   come to an agreement respecting Master Interrogatories and Requests for
   Admission and any further Demands for Production of Documents which
   plaintiffs may wish to serve on defendants. The purpose of such an
   agreement would be to achieve a reasonable result for all state court
   and federal court cases, prevent duplication and avoid the need for
   judicial intervention. Failing to reach such an agreement, the parties
   agree that the matter shall be presented to the MDL court for
   resolution. 7. The defendants will withdraw their Motion for Injunction
   without prejudice and reserving their rights to re-urge same in the
   event and in defendants' sole and exclusive judgment that discovery
   and/or class certification coordination is not functioning. The Fact of
   this Agreement shall not be used for any purpose by any party should
   the Motion for Injunction be refiled. Any party to this Agreement may
   withdraw from it upon 90 days notice to the other parties. The
   Agreement shall remain in effect for that withdrawing party during the
   90-day period. 8. The defendants stipulate that the making of this
   Agreement by any party to a state court case and their counsel is not
   an acknowledgment by them that the MDL Court has authority over
   management of pretrial activity in those cases other than as set forth
   in this Agreement. The defendants further stipulate that the making of
   this Agreement by a party to a state court case and their counsel is
   for the sole purpose of providing a vehicle for deposition management.
   It has been made for the sole purpose of achieving a system for
   effective coordination of deposition activity in both the state court
   and federal court cases. DATED: November 30, 2001 /s/ Russ M. Herman
