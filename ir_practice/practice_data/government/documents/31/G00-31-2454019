                  TOVS problem: rerun from 1/97 to present

   [new.png] The TOVS-land problem has be rerun. The data sets are in the
   process of being updated to revised analyses (March 1, 1997-Sept 18,
   2001).
   [new.png] Rotating CDAS archive has been updated.

   detailed summary of observational data used by Reanalysis.
   background error used by the assimilation system (SSI).

   1/3/2000: Y2K problem: some observational data were being incorrectly
   rejected. This problem only affected the 12/31/1999 analyses were fixed
   1/3/2000 (6pm).

   News: Found a "truncation" error with the snow analyses. Fixed Dec 1.
   More details to follow.

                              Rotating Archives

   CDAS is now updated daily and the daily updates are being stored in the
   "CDAS rotating archives." These archives include more data than in our
   on-line historical archives such as four times daily analyses and more
   daily-averaged fields. The historical archives will continue to be
   updated once a month.

                          Annual Reanalysis CD-ROMs

   1951-2000 Reanalysis CD-ROMs are now available. Contact NCAR for more
   information.

   The Reanalysis Synoptic CD-ROM with global 00Z analyses from 1979-1996
   is available. Fields on this CD-ROM include HGT (1000 mb, 500 mb),
   WINDS (850 mb, 200mb) and OMEGA (500 mb). This CD-ROM, like the
   annuals, is GrADS compatible and includes an MS-DOS menu system and is
   available from NCAR .

   In the pipeline:
   **SOON** ECMWF (ERA) vs NCEP Reanalysis (NCEP access only)
   A twice daily, Northern Hemisphere Synoptic CD-ROM
   More annual CD-ROMs
   BAMS article with CD-ROM with 50 years of monthly means (submitted)

                           What is it all about ?

   The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project is a joint project between the
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, formerly "NMC")
   and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The goal of
   this joint effort is to produce new atmospheric analyses using
   historical data (1948 onwards) and as well to produce analyses of the
   current atmospheric state (Climate Data Assimilation System, CDAS).

   Until recently, the meteorological community has had to use analyses
   that supported the real-time weather forecasting. These analyses are
   very inhomogeneous in time as there have been big improvements in the
   data assimilation systems. This played havoc with climate monitoring as
   these improvements were often produced changes in the apparent
   "climate". Even fundamental quantities such as the strength of the
   Hadley cell has changed over the years as a result of the changes in
   the data assimilation systems.

   The quality and utility of the re-analyses should be superior to NCEP's
   original analyses because
     * a state-of-the-art data assimilation is used
     * more observations are used
     * quality control has been improved
     * the model/data assimilation procedure will remain essentially
       unchanged during the project
     * many more fields are being saved (ex. potential vorticity on
       isentropic surfaces, diabatic heating)
     * global (some older analyses were hemispheric)
     * better vertical resolution (stratosphere)

   The future plans for Reanalysis are to do a regional Reanalysis for the
   USA. Comments from potential users are wanted.

   Feb 5 1999: Jan. 1999 CDAS is being rerun. A change in buffer table
   caused the GOES not to be used.

   Problems with March 1997-December 1997 reanalyses were found which will
   require a rerun of the affected months. The problem is with the
   inclusion of too much Indian station data. More details are available.

   Problems with aircraft winds used for 1976-1978 were discovered and the
   rerun was completed Jan 8, 1997. The aircraft data were transposed E-W
   which reduced the anomaly correlation by 5 points in a 5 day forecast.
   The effect of this bad jet-level data should be less severe in the
   lower troposphere. This web site will have the updated data after an
   examination and the Phoenix AMS meeting.

   The "final" TOGA-COARE (Nov92-Feb93) analysis still needs to be rerun.
   The data on this web server is an interim analysis which doesn't use
   the TOGA-COARE data. Tapes from NCAR and CDC was well as the annual
   CD-ROMs contain the first version which is cold over the TOGA-COARE
   region.

   pre-QC observations counts are now available.

   IBM/SP CDAS: Starting with May 1, 2000 Analyses causes changes.

                Things are not perfect . . . Problem Report:

     * The Annual CD-ROM demo program put the wrong date on sample plot 4
       (daily OLR).
     * An error was discovered in how the 79-92 PAOBS data were used by
       Reanalysis
     * Updates to the March 1996 BAMS Reanalysis Paper/CDROM
     * Oct. and Nov. 1985 Tape Problem
     * Spurious moisture source (spectral snow)
     * Operations vs Reanalysis GRIB
     * Problems with the snow cover
     * TOGA COARE
     * 1976-1978 rerun was completed Jan. 9, 1998. This rerun corrects an
       error in positioning of some aircraft data (E/W transposed) new
     * poorly encoded surface/mean-sea-level pressure observations were
       rejected (1948-1967).
     * TOVS-land problem: rerun from 1/1997 to present
     * GRBSANL grid was misidentified.
