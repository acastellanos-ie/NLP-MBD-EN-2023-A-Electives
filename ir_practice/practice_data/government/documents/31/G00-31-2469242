                              COLLEGE EDUCATION
   Earn Money For College!

   In the Army National Guard you can earn more than $21,000 for higher
   education. Some schools even give academic credit for Army Guard
   training and service. Here's how it breaks down:
     *  over $8,500 for tuition with the Montgomery GI Bill with no money
       contribution by you.
     *  75% Tuition Assistance at all accredited colleges.
     *  Free College Level Exams Program (ACT, SAT, CLEP, DSST, GRE)
     *  A possible $4,000 enlistment bonus for enlistment.
     *  A monthly pay check starting immediately after enlistment.
     *  Become a member of the Service Members Opportunity College (SOC)
     *  College credit for Military training and Experience.

   The Guard College Plan does not decided what college or degree you will
   be attending, but instead that is left up to you.
