   Breaking News We've updated and expanded our Legislation Page.  Check
   out the original legislation that created the forthcoming American
   Buffalo Coin, the Golden Dollar, the General Colin L. Powell Medal, and
   more.  The Public Laws that make U.S. Mint coins possible are treasure
   troves of information for journalists, collectors and scholars.
   They're the last word on a coin's issue dates, metallic content, and
   design.  They also survey the American events and achievements each
   coin commemorates.
