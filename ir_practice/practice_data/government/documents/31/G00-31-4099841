                                VISA BULLETIN

                                  Number 41
                                 Volume VIII

                     IMMIGRANT NUMBERS FOR FEBRUARY 2002

    A. STATUTORY NUMBERS

   1. This bulletin summarizes the availability of immigrant numbers
   during February. Consular officers are required to report to the
   Department of State documentarily qualified applicants for numerically
   limited visas; the Immigration and Naturalization Service reports
   applicants for adjustment of status. Allocations were made, to the
   extent possible under the numerical limitations, for the demand
   received by January 8th in the chronological order of the reported
   priority dates. If the demand could not be satisfied within the
   statutory or regulatory limits, the category or foreign state in which
   demand was excessive was deemed oversubscribed. The cut-off date for an
   oversubscribed category is the priority date of the first applicant who
   could not be reached within the numerical limits. Only applicants who
   have a priority date earlier than the cut-off date may be allotted a
   number. Immediately that it becomes necessary during the monthly
   allocation process to retrogress a cut-off date, supplemental requests
   for numbers will be honored only if the priority date falls within the
   new cut-off date.

   2. Section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets an
   annual minimum family-sponsored preference limit of 226,000. The
   worldwide level for annual employment-based preference immigrants is at
   least 140,000. Section 202 prescribes that the per-country limit for
   preference immigrants is set at 7% of the total annual family-sponsored
   and employment-based preference limits, i.e., 25,620. The dependent
   area limit is set at 2%, or 7,320.
   3. Section 203 of the INA prescribes preference classes for allotment
   of immigrant visas as follows:

   FAMILY-SPONSORED PREFERENCES

   First: Unmarried Sons and Daughters of Citizens: 23,400 plus any
   numbers not required for fourth preference.

   Second: Spouses and Children, and Unmarried Sons and Daughters of
   Permanent Residents: 114,200, plus the number (if any) by which the
   worldwide family preference level exceeds 226,000, and any unused first
   preference numbers:

   A. Spouses and Children: 77% of the overall second preference
   limitation, of which 75% are exempt from the per-country limit;

   B. Unmarried Sons and Daughters (21 years of age or older): 23% of the
   overall second preference limitation.

   Third: Married Sons and Daughters of Citizens: 23,400, plus any numbers
   not required by first and second preferences.

   Fourth: Brothers and Sisters of Adult Citizens: 65,000, plus any
   numbers not required by first three preferences.

   EMPLOYMENT-BASED PREFERENCES

   First: Priority Workers: 28.6% of the worldwide employment-based
   preference level, plus any numbers not required for fourth and fifth
   preferences.

   Second: Members of the Professions Holding Advanced Degrees or Persons
   of Exceptional Ability: 28.6% of the worldwide employment-based
   preference level, plus any numbers not required by first preference.

   Third: Skilled Workers, Professionals, and Other Workers: 28.6% of the
   worldwide level, plus any numbers not required by first and second
   preferences, not more than 10,000 of which to "Other Workers."

   Fourth: Certain Special Immigrants: 7.1% of the worldwide level.

   Fifth: Employment Creation: 7.1% of the worldwide level, not less than
   3,000 of which reserved for investors in a targeted rural or
   high-unemployment area, and 3,000 set aside for investors in regional
   centers by Sec. 610 of P.L. 102-395.

   4. INA Section 203(e) provides that family-sponsored and
   employment-based preference visas be issued to eligible immigrants in
   the order in which a petition in behalf of each has been filed. Section
   203(d) provides that spouses and children of preference immigrants are
   entitled to the same status, and the same order of consideration, if
   accompanying or following to join the principal. The visa prorating
   provisions of Section 202(e) apply to allocations for a foreign state
   or dependent area when visa demand exceeds the per-country limit. These
   provisions apply at present to the following oversubscribed
   chargeability areas: INDIA, MEXICO, and PHILIPPINES.

   5. On the chart below, the listing of a date for any class indicates
   that the class is oversubscribed (see paragraph 1); "C" means current,
   i.e., numbers are available for all qualified applicants; and "U" means
   unavailable, i.e., no numbers are available. (NOTE: Numbers are
   available only for applicants whose priority date is earlier than the
   cut-off date listed below.)

   The Department of State has available a recorded message with visa
   availability information which can be heard at (202) 663-1541. This
   recording will be updated in the middle of each month with information
   on cut-off dates for the following month.

    B. DIVERSITY IMMIGRANT (DV) CATEGORY

   Section 203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides a
   maximum of up to 55,000 immigrant visas each fiscal year to permit
   immigration opportunities for persons from countries other than the
   principal sources of current immigration to the United States. The
   Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (NCARA) passed by Congress
   in November 1997 stipulates that beginning with DV-99, and for as long
   as necessary, up to 5,000 of the 55,000 annually-allocated diversity
   visas will be made available for use under the NCARA program. This
   reduction has resulted in the DV-2002 annual limit being reduced to
   50,000. DV visas are divided among six geographic regions. No one
   country can receive more than seven percent of the available diversity
   visas in any one year.

   For February, immigrant numbers in the DV category are available to
   qualified DV-2002 applicants chargeable to all regions/eligible
   countries as follows. When an allocation cut-off number is shown, visas
   are available only for applicants with DV regional lottery rank numbers
   BELOW the specified allocation cut-off number:

   All DV Chargeability Areas Except Those Listed Separately

   Region

   AFRICA: AF 8,000
   ASIA: AS 6,825Except: Bangladesh 2,675
   EUROPE: EU 8,100
   NORTH AMERICA (BAHAMAS): NA 8
   OCEANIA: OC 290
   SOUTH AMERICA, and the CARIBBEAN: SA 690

   Entitlement to immigrant status in the DV category lasts only through
   the end of the fiscal (visa) year for which the applicant is selected
   in the lottery. The year of entitlement for all applicants registered
   for the DV-2002 program ends as of September 30, 2002. DV visas may not
   be issued to DV-2002 applicants after that date. Similarly, spouses and
   children accompanying or following to join DV-2002 principals are only
   entitled to derivative DV status until September 30, 2001. DV visa
   availability through the very end of FY-2002 cannot be taken for
   granted. Numbers could be exhausted prior to September 30. Once all
   numbers provided by law for the DV-2002 program have been used, no
   further issuances will be possible.

    C. ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF THE DIVERSITY (DV) IMMIGRANT CATEGORY RANK
    CUT-OFFS WHICH WILL APPLY IN MARCH

   For March, immigrant numbers in the DV category are available to
   qualified DV-2002 applicants chargeable to all regions/eligible
   countries as follows. When an allocation cut-off number is shown, visas
   are available only for applicants with DV regional lottery rank numbers
   BELOW the specified allocation cut-off number:

   SOUTH AMERICA, and the CARIBBEAN: SA 825

   D. MEXICO FAMILY FIRST PREFERENCE BECOMES UNAVAILABLE

   Allocations in the Mexico Family First preference category have reached
   the FY-2002 annual limit. Therefore, this category has become
   "Unavailable" beginning in February, and will remain so for the
   remainder of the fiscal year.
