      Insurance Fraud

   ORGANIZATION: In March 1996, Pennsylvania's Insurance Fraud Section was
   formally launched -- one of only eight such law enforcement units in
   the country. This Section aggressively investigates and prosecutes
   schemes that cost as much as 25 cents of every insurance dollar paid by
   Pennsylvanians.

   This Section is funded by a grant from the Insurance Fraud Prevention
   Authority ("IFPA"), a quasi-governmental entity which utilizes funds
   obtained through an anual $8 million assessment on all insurance
   companies doing business in the Commonwealth. The IFPA was created as
   part of a package of legislation signed into law in late 1994.

   GOALS: The OAG Insurance Fraud Section has the following goals:

        [bullet.jpg] To aggressively pursue insurance fraud and workers
                compensation in investigations and prosecutions of
                fraudulent claims throughout the Commonwealth covering the
                myriad of fraudulent claim activity, from health care
                fraud to staged accidents

        [bullet.jpg] To become the primary insurance fraud enforcement
                authority within the Commonwealth

        [bullet.jpg] To develop programs to educate the public and private
                sectors about insurance fraud and heighten public
                awareness to where insurance fraud is no longer viewed as
                a victimless crime that cannot be punished

        [bullet.jpg] To cooperate with other law enforcement agencies and
                the insurance industry to combat insurance fraud

   REFERRALS: The Insurance Fraud Section initiates investigations upon
   referrals from insurance companies' special investigative units or
   claims representatives of insurance carriers doing business in the
   Commonwealth. In 1996, the Insurance Fraud Section handled more than
   550 referrals.

   In addition to the work done to combat insurance fraud within the
   borders of Pennsylvania, this Section is a member of several
   multi-state fraud control organizations which closely monitor national
   trends in fraudulent activity. This Section also coordinates
   intelligence on insurance fraud with the Pennsylvania Department of
   Insurance and attorneys general throughout the country.
