   Mission Objectives:

             Click here for Additional Info on STS-108

             STS-108 will be the 12th space shuttle mission to visit the
             International Space Station and the 4th mission to utilize the
             Italian Multipurpose Logistics Module (MPLM). There are three
             MPLMs and this flight will use the one called Raffaello which
             flew once before on STS-100. Raffaello will be attached to the
             stations Unity node while unloading its cargo, much of which
             will be transfered into the U.S. Lab called Destiny. Eight
             resupply stowage racks and four resupply stowage platforms will
             be unloaded.

             The flight will also feature a spacewalk to install thermal
             blankets over the Beta Gimbal Assemblies (BGAs) at the bases of
             the space station's solar panels. The BGAs, mounted atop the
             stations P6 Truss, control the panels to keep them at an optimal
             angle in relation to the sun.

             Other Payloads on this mission include the Lightweight Mission
             Peculiar Support Structure Carrier (LMC) with four Get Away
             Special (GAS) experiments and the Multiple Application
             Customized Hitchhiker-1 (MACH-1) Payload. The MACH-1 payload
             contains the Starshine, Capilary Pumped Loop Experiment-3, the
             Prototype Synchrotron Radiation Detector, two Space Experiment
             Modules containing multiple small experiments and a GAS canister
             containing seven experiments.

             Just forward of the Hitchhiker, on the right payload bay wall,
             are two GAS containers, one housing seven experiments from Utah
             State University and the other with an experiment looking at
             smoldering combustion in microgravity. Behind Raffaello, at the
             rear of the cargo bay, is the Lightweight Multipurpose
             Experiment Support Structure Carrier (LMC), with four more GAS
             canisters. One has three Penn State University experiments and
             another contains 10 student experiments. A third houses a
             Swedish Space Corp. experiment focusing on weak Marangoni flows
             and the fourth, from Ames Research Center, is a test of a
             prototype instrument cooler for planetary missions. In
             Endeavour's middeck area will be the Avian Development Facility
             and the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module Animal Enclosure
             Module. The Avian Development Facility is flown to validate
             subsystems and will contain two experiments on development in
             space of Japanese quail eggs. The Animal Enclosure Module is a
             commercial experiment using mice and seeking information that
             could lead to better treatment of osteoporosis in humans.

   Launch:

             Wednesday, December 5, 2001 5:19pm EST (22:19 UTC)

             On Wednesday, December 5, 2001, the launch countdown proceeded
             as scheduled. Tanking began at 7:45am EST and completed shortly
             after 11:00am EST. At 1:30p.m. EST the astronauts departed the
             crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building (O&C) for
             the 20 minute ride to Pad 39-B. By 3:00pm. they were strapped in
             and ready for the terminal count. At 17:12 p.m. EST the Orbiter
             Access Arm was retracted and launch occured exactly on time at
             the beginning of the window. Main Engine Cutoff occured at the 8
             minute 26 second mark.

             On Tuesday, December 4, 2001, the launch was scheduled for 5:45
             p.m. EST. The crew left the O&C building, departed for Launch
             Pad 39-B and entered the orbiter. At 15:40 p.m. EST the hatch
             was closed and locked for flight. At 16:40 p.m. EST the
             countdown clock came out of the hold at the T-minus 20 minute
             mark. After a final poll of the launch team, the mission
             management team gave a go to countdown to the T-minus 5 minute
             mark. The only constraint was due to weather. At 17:37 EST, the
             countdown clock came out of the hold at the T-minus 9 minute
             mark and counted down to T-minus 5 minutes. A go was given for
             Orbiter Access Arm retract. At 17:44, STA, RTLS and range were
             all no-go due to weather constraints and the launch was scrubbed
             with a 24 hour recycle.

             The launch attempt for Thursday, November 29, 2001 (7:44p.m.
             EST) was delayed to give officials time to analyze a problem
             with a Russian Progress freighter that is not fully hard docked
             to the aft port of the Zvezda service module.

             Launch preparations for Shuttle Endeavour remain on schedule at
             Pad B. Ordnance installation and pressurization of the
             hypergolic propellant system are complete. Work in progress
             includes final stowage in both the Raffaello Multi-Purpose
             Logistics Module (MPLM) and the crew compartment. External Tank
             purge and aft closeouts are under way. No work is scheduled for
             the Thanksgiving holidays (Thursday-Friday). Over the weekend,
             the launch crew will begin preparations for picking up the final
             countdown, scheduled for 11 p.m. Monday, Nov. 26. The seven
             STS-108 crewmembers will arrive at KSC on Sunday, Nov. 25.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 11/20/2001)

             Shuttle Endeavour remains on schedule for launch on Nov. 29. At
             Pad B, the STS-108 flight crew participated in the Terminal
             Countdown Demonstration Test that was completed successfully
             this morning. The crew will return to Houston this afternoon.
             Later today, the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM)
             will be installed into Endeavour's payload bay. This weekend,
             pad technicians will replace the yaw actuator arm in Space
             Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) #2 and preparations will begin for
             hypergol propellant loading. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             11/09/01)
