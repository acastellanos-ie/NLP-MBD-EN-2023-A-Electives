                      Magnetotail Constellation DRACO:
                       Magnetotail Constellation DRACO


     Breaking News...
       * 15 June 2001: Magnetospheric Constellation Mission STDT Report
         Available...

     Enabling Technology Requirements:
       * "Nanosat" fabrication and deployment techniques.
       * Miniaturized instrumentation for magnetic fields, plasmas, and
         energetic particles.
       * Integrated "sciencecraft" systems design.
       * Advanced data synthesis and visualization techniques.
       * Advanced techniques for data assimilation into numerical global
         circulation models.


   Fundamental Question:
     * How does the magnetotail store, transport, and release matter and
       energy?

   Science Objectives:
     * Determine the equilibria of the magnetotail.
     * Understand the responses of the magnetotail to the solar wind.
     * Reveal the instabilities of the magnetotail.
     * Map the linkages between local and global processes.

   Mission Description:
     * Distributed network of space weather observatories.
     * Constellation of 50-100 nano-satellites acquires vector images of
       the magnetic and plasma flow fields.
     * Elliptical orbits with dense sampling from 7 - 40 R[E] with a
       resolution of 1-2 R[E].

   Measurement Strategy:
     * Simultaneous multi-point measurements resolving system scales down
       to 1-2 R[E] over a 40 R[E] domain.
     * Measure magnetic and plasma scalar and vector fields.
     * Track propagating fronts and disturbances as they are launched and
       travel in the magnetotail.
     * Construct time-dependent maps of large-scale current systems
     * Develop synoptic maps of plasma flows into and away from
       magnetotail particle acceleration regions.
