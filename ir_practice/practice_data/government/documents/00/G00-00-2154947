   be available for active water level stations on our Tides Online and
   Great Lakes Online web sites. Available meteorological and prediction
   data will also be available at these sites. Historical and Verified
   data will NOT be available during this time. Sorry for the
   inconvenience.

   The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)
   collects, analyzes and distributes historical and real-time
   observations and predictions of water levels, coastal currents and
   other meteorological and oceanographic data. This is part of an
   integrated National Ocean Service program supporting safe maritime
   navigation, more productive water-borne commerce, and the needs of the
   National Weather Service, coastal zone management, engineering and
   surveying communities. The Center manages the National Water Level
   Observation Program and the national network of Physical Oceanographic
   Real-Time Systems in major U.S. harbors. It conducts its programs
   through university, industry, Federal and State partnerships as
   appropriate. CO-OPS resides within NOAA's National Ocean Service.
