   rotating black hole: 3-D view Advanced supercomputers have simulated
   extremely powerful energy jets squirted out by black holes, the most
   exotic and powerful objects in the Universe. This 3-D graphic shows
   rotating space around a black hole (black sphere at center) twisting up
   magnetic field lines near it (red tubes). Green tubes show magnetic
   field lines which have not yet entered that space.

   model of asteroid 1998 ML14 Scientists use pictures to determine how
   gravity would tug at a rover exploring the lumpy surface of an
   asteroid. This model of asteroid 1998 ML14 shows the varying
   gravitational slopes -- purple is flat, orange is steep.
