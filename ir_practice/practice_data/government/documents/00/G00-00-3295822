                                Geodetic VLBI

   Welcome to the home page of the VLBI Group of NASA's Space Geodesy
   Program, Thomas A. Clark, Head. The Very Long Baseline Interferometry
   (VLBI) program is a component of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
   The VLBI group coordinates the international geodetic VLBI observing
   program in close cooperation with the U.S. Naval Observatory's Earth
   Orientation Department, performs basic research in geodesy to improve
   the VLBI technique, analyzes VLBI data from numerous sources to produce
   exhaustive reports, and sets standards and performs quality control
   functions for the geodetic VLBI community.

   The home page for the IVS (International VLBI Service for Geodesy and
   Astrometry has moved to its new location.
