   in NAIS and CBDNet, notice will be posted at this web site
   (sewpiii.sewp.nasa.gov) and links will be provided to the
   announcements. Each announcement will list a point of contact for
   information and only that point of contact will be authorized to answer
   questions concerning the follow-on procurement. It is the
   responsibility of all interested parties to monitor NAIS and CBDNet for
   SEWP III information. Interested Parties should also check regularly at
   this website. Dates of postings will be clearly noted and the date at
   the bottom of this page will reflect the latest date any material was
   changed at this site.

   NOTE: The NASA SEWP BOWL staff, the SEWP Hotline, and the SEWP Website
   are only able to respond to questions related to the currently active
   SEWP contracts.. All issues concerning the Class 10 and 12 RFP will be
   handled either through NAIS, CBDNet, and/or the NASA Goddard Space
   Flight Center Information Systems Technology Procurement Office.
