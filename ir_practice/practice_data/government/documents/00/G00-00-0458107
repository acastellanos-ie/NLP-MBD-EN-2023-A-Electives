   OVERVIEW

   Science Applications International Corporation Frederick (SAIC
   Frederick) works at the leading edge of cancer and AIDS research and
   biotechnology for the National Cancer Institute's Frederick Cancer
   Research and Development Center (NCI-Frederick), a division of the
   National Institutes of Health. We have over 1,200 scientists,
   technicians, engineers, administrative, maintenance, and support staff
   working under the largest single research contract awarded by the
   Department of Health and Human Services.

   SAIC Frederick helps screen over 50,000 compounds a year for anticancer
   and antiviral properties, develop new drugs for cancer and AIDS
   treatment, and operate the world's only supercomputer devoted strictly
   to biomedical research.

   OUR HISTORY

   Founded in 1969 by a small group of dedicated scientists, SAIC and its
   subsidiaries, including SAIC Frederick, have offices in over 150 cities
   worldwide. With its subsidiaries, about half of SAIC's business is
   composed of federal and state government contracts, mostly in national
   security work. The other half of SAIC's business consists of commercial
   and international projects.

   Our commitment to excellence in all aspects of cancer research is the
   foundation of our progress. If you share our commitment, explore these
   opportunities that will challenge your interests. Youll work in a
   campus-like setting in Frederick, MD near Baltimore and Washington, DC.
   With several colleges nearby and our tuition assistance program, youll
   be able to continue your education.
