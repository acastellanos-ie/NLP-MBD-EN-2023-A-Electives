   Background Information
   In 1970, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) was
   created by Congress to relieve the freight railroads of the burden of
   money-losing passenger operations and to preserve rail passenger
   service over a national system of Congressionally-designated routes.
   Amtrak was created as a for-profit government corporation that was
   granted the right of access to the tracks owned by the freight
   railroads at incremental cost and with operating priority over freight
   trains. Amtrak was also granted a monopoly to provide intercity rail
   transportation over its route system and was to receive federal
   subsidies for the first few years, but then it was expected to make a
   profit.

   Amtrak

   In 1997, after 26 years and approximately $22 billion in federal
   operating subsidies and capital investments, and an overall trend of
   stagnant ridership, Congress debated the viability of continuing to
   fund Amtrak, knowing that without federal funds, Amtrak would cease
   operations. The Senate reached a compromise by passing by unanimous
   consent the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (which became
   law on December 2, 1997). This Act (P.L. 105-134) provided that Amtrak
   (a) would no longer be a government corporation or hold a rail
   passenger monopoly; (b) would be allowed to add new routes and close
   money-losing routes; (c) would receive approximately $2.2 billion in
   Taxpayer Relief Act funds; and (d) would have to achieve operational
   self-sufficiency (i.e., no longer receive federal operating grants)
   five years after the enactment of the Act.

   The Act also created the Amtrak Reform Council, an independent
   bipartisan federal commission of eleven (11) members whose statutory
   mandate was to: (a) make recommendations to Amtrak to help it reach
   operational self-sufficiency; (b) report annually to Congress on
   Amtraks performance in several areas; (c) if the Council were to find
   that Amtrak would be unable to achieve its goal of operational
   self-sufficiency by December 2, 2002, then submit to Congress a plan
   for a rationalized and restructured national rail passenger system; and
   (d) if such a finding were made by the Council, Amtrak would submit a
   plan for Amtraks liquidation to the Congress.

   Brief History of the Amtrak Reform Council

   The Amtrak Reform Council (Council) has eleven Council members (six
   appointed by Republicans, four appointed by Democrats, and the
   Secretary of Transportation). Highlights of the Council's brief history
   are summarized below.

   In 1998, the responsible officials made their appointments to the
   Council, with a quorum of Council members not available to hold a
   meeting until May of that year. During the remainder of 1998, while the
   rest of the Council was being appointed, the Council considered various
   approaches to carrying out its mandate. In January 1999, following the
   resignation of the Council's first chairman, Governor Christie Todd
   Whitman of New Jersey, the Council elected Gilbert E. Carmichael, a
   former Federal Railroad Administrator and a former Amtrak Board Member,
   as Chairman. He secured the Council's approval to hire a staff, and, in
   March 1999, Thomas A. Till, former Deputy Federal Railroad
   Administrator, was hired as the Executive Director.

   Mr. Till proposed, and the Council approved, plans to hold Outreach
   Hearings throughout the country, inviting states to provide their views
   about intercity rail passenger service. From March 1999 to November
   1999, the Council held five hearings: (1) in Philadelphia, PA, for the
   Northeast Corridor that runs between Washington, D.C. and Boston, MA;
   (2) in Charlotte, NC, for the emerging Southeast Corridor from Virginia
   to Florida; (3) in Seattle, WA, for the Pacific Northwest Corridor from
   Oregon to British Columbia; (4) in Chicago, IL, for the Midwest
   Regional Rail Initiative states; and (5) in Dallas, TX for the
   South/Southwestern regions of the United States.

   In November 1999, the Council sent its first letter of recommendations
   for improvement to Amtrak. The letter suggested that Amtrak consider
   taking a number of actions, including: 1) separating the financial
   statements of the NEC infrastructure from those of Amtrak's nationwide
   train operations, 2) doing the same for Amtrak's Mail & Express
   business, 3) substantially reducing corporate overhead, 4) instituting
   a program of continuing annual cost reductions, and 5) developing
   contingency plans for corrective action in the event Amtrak's Strategic
   Business Plan performs below expectations.

   In January 2000, the Council released its First Annual Report to
   Congress, which discussed the broad range of functions Amtrak performs,
   from train operator to infrastructure owner to real estate developer.
   The Council expressed the view that this extensive set of functions
   kept Amtrak from focusing effectively on its core business of intercity
   rail passenger service. The report also set forth the financial
   criteria the Council proposed to use to determine operational
   self-sufficiency.

   In 2000, the Council held three additional hearings: (1) in Denver, CO,
   for the Mountain States; (2) in Sacramento, CA, for the state of
   California; and (3) in Burlington, VT for the New England States. In
   addition, the state of Florida testified before the Council at a
   meeting in Washington, D.C. The Council also released a Summary of
   Principal Provisions of Laws Pertaining to Amtrak, and prepared a staff
   working paper on issues relating to Amtrak's ownership of the rail
   infrastructure on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C. and
   Boston, MA. (The principle issues explored in the working paper on the
   Northeast Corridor were reflected in the Council's Second Annual
   Report, which was released March 2001.)

   In addition, in September 2000, the Council testified before the Senate
   Commerce Committee regarding the proposed High Speed Rail Investment
   Act, which would have authorized Amtrak to issue up to $10 billion in
   bonds over 10 years to fund infrastructure projects, with a 20 percent
   funding match to be provided by the states. The ARC testified that it
   agreed on the need for additional infrastructure funding, but suggested
   several amendments to the legislation including that: 1) the states and
   high-speed rail authorities, as well as Amtrak, would be permitted to
   issue the proposed bonds, and 2) all funds would be under the control
   of an independent trustee until actually expended for the capital
   projects, and should not be commingled with the internal finances of
   the bond issuers.

   In March 2001, the Council released its Second Annual Report to
   Congress that: 1) described the fundamental structural flaws of Amtrak
   as an institution; 2) outlined a new business model for Amtrak to
   correct the flaws; 3) offered a spectrum of five options for
   restructuring Amtrak, and 4) discussed possible funding options for
   investments that support intercity rail passenger service.

   Also in March 2001, the Council approved holding four public hearings
   at which the states would be invited to discuss the issues outlined in
   the Second Annual Report. The first of these hearings was in June 2001
   in Newark, NJ. This hearing focused mainly on the Council's proposal to
   "appropriately separate" the Northeast Corridor infrastructure from
   Amtrak's national train operations. The states, Amtrak, commuter train
   operators, and the freight railroads, all of which share the use of the
   Northeast Corridor, were invited to testify.

   In July 2001, the Council sent a second letter of recommendations for
   improvement to Amtrak stating that Amtrak should consider: 1) changing
   its organization to implement a separation of infrastructure
   responsibility from train operating responsibility, including separate
   financial statements, 2) framing its funding request to Congress to
   reflect infrastructure needs separately from train operations needs,
   and 3) revisiting the recommendations of the Council's November 1999
   letter, most of which Amtrak had not implemented

   Also in July, the Council testified before the Subcommittee on
   Railroads of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
   regarding the Council's Second Annual Report, Amtrak's recent financial
   progress toward operational self-sufficiency, and the latest
   legislative proposals for High-Speed Rail Bonds. Regarding the Bonds,
   the Council reiterated its position that: 1) Amtrak should not be the
   only entity able to issue the bonds; and 2) that the bond proceeds
   should be controlled at all times by an independent trustee, and should
   not in any way be co-mingled with the internal finances of the bond
   issuers.

   The Council held a public hearing in St. Louis in July 2001, inviting
   the states in the Central Region of the United States to testify before
   the Council on issues related to the Council's Second Annual Report.

   Current Activities of the Council

   The Council is currently planning two additional public hearings, for
   states to provide official testimony concerning issues related to the
   Council's Second Annual Report. On September 20, 2001, the Council is
   planning a public hearing in Los Angeles, CA, for the Mountain and West
   Coast states, and on October 12, 2001, the Council is planning a public
   Hearing in Atlanta, GA, for the Southern and East Coast states.
