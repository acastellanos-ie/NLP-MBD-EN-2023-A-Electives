   JPL Robotics researchers perform development, integration, and
   demonstration of innovative robotics and automation technologies,
   supporting NASA missions and addressing other problems of national
   importance. Researchers work toward enabling more efficient, lower cost
   missions dedicated to planetary surface and solar system exploration,
   Earth observations from space, astrophysical experiments in space and
   on the Moon, and the extension of human capabilities in space.
