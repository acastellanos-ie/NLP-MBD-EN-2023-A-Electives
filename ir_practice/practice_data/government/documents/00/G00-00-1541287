   On February 10, 1989, the National Science Board (NSB), in compliance
   with the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100-504),
   established NSF's Office of Inspector General (OIG). The OIG is headed
   by an Inspector General (IG), who reports directly to the NSB and
   Congress. Under the Law, the IG has the authority and responsibility to
   conduct audits, inspections, and investigations involving any NSF
   proposal, award, program, function, system, or operation. OIG is also
   responsible for:
     * promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the
       administration of NSF programs and operations;
     * preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in
       NSF programs and operations;
     * commenting on legislation and regulations that affect NSF;
     * preventing, detecting, and handling cases involving misconduct in
       science; and
     * issuing Semiannual Reports to the Congress that describe OIG
       activities.

   In support of these responsibilities, OIG has statutory authority to
   subpoena or otherwise obtain all records, files, reports, documents, or
   materials needed to conduct audits, inspections, and investigations.
   The IG is independent and may not be prevented from carrying out any
   audit, inspection, or investigation or issuing any report.

   For more information on allegations of misconduct in science, fraud,
   waste, abuse, or mismanagement, you may call us at
   (703) 292-7100 or e-mail us at oig@nsf.gov.
