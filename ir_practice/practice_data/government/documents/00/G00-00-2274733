   The National Plant Data Center (NPDC) focuses resources on the
   acquisition, development, integration, quality control, dissemination
   and access of plant information; the NPDC works with partners to
   incorporate new plant technology into the agency's automated tools.

   The NPDC is responsible for the PLANTS database, which focuses on the
   vascular and nonvascular plants of the United States and its
   territories. The PLANTS database includes checklists, species
   abstracts, distributional data, crop information, plants symbols, plant
   growth data, references and other plant information. PLANTS reduces
   costs by reducing the duplication of efforts and by making information
   exchange possible across agencies and disciplines.
