                  Physics at Run II -- Supersymmetry/Higgs
          ________________________________________________________

   A homepage for the Supersymmetry/Higgs workshop in preparation for Run
                        II at the Fermilab Tevatron.
          ________________________________________________________

   The workshop was ongoing February thru November, 1998. The summary
   meeting was held at Fermilab on November 19-21, 1998. Activity of the
   Higgs Working Group continues. Organization of the workshop is a joint
   effort of the CDF and D0 collaborations with the Fermilab Theoretical
   Physics Department. The overall coordinators at Fermilab are Marcela
   Carena and Joe Lykken.

  SIMULATION TOOLS:

     * SHW is the simplified simulation package for the Run II Workshop.
       It provides a parametrized easy-to-use detector simulation which
       mimics an "average" of D0/CDF Run II performance. If you know how
       to use ISAJET or PYTHIA, you should be able to use SHW. Even
       theorists can do it!
       Latest version plus documentation is available HERE. WE STRONGLY
       ENCOURAGE USE OF THIS PACKAGE.

  THE FIRST GENERAL MEETING:

     * More than 150 people participated in the First General Meeting!
     * We have scanned the transparencies from (most) of the talks onto
       this website. See below.
