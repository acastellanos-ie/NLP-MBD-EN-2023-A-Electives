   Our Journey begins
   On the Trail of the Northern Atlantic Right Whale

   The New England Aquarium and NOAA Fisheries has enlisted the help of
   NOAA's National Marine Sanctuaries to initiate a research tagging
   program that gives biologists a rare opportunity to study the nation's
   most endangered large whale species, the North Atlantic right whale.
   Several thousand right whales once existed in the North Atlantic Ocean,
   but years of commercial hunting at the turn of the century severely
   depleted the stocks. Today the right whale is threatened by ship
   strikes, fishing nets, and habitat loss. Current estimates indicate
   that fewer than 350 remain in the North Atlantic Ocean.

   This scientific cruise, launched on January 6 from Fernandina Beach,
   Florida, joins:
     * New England Aquarium,
     * NOAA's Fisheries Service, Office of Protected Resources,
     * Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary,
     * Georgia Department of Natural Resources,
     * and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection

   The collaborative effort will use very high frequency (VHF) radio
   technology to observe and document the behavior of right whale cows and
   calves in their winter range, the coastal waters of the southeast U.S.
   When weather permits, researchers will be monitoring tagged whales 24
   hours a day for the next six weeks. A mission log and photographs will
   be available on the cruise home page at this Web site.

   In earlier tagging cruises in 1995-1998, NEA attached satellite linked
   tags to six right whale cows to better understand their vulnerability
   during the calving seasons. Scientists obtained daily movement data for
   a period of 10-31 days and migratory movements from two of these tags
   that transmitted locations for 53 and 102 days. These tracks suggest a
   constant rate of movement during migration, perhaps making the whales
   less vulnerable to vessel strikes than during their winter residence in
   the southeast.

   Although much was learned from the satellite-monitored tags, New
   England Aquarium and NOAA scientists hope that the 1999 cruise will
   allow them to track mothers and calves over the course of several
   weeks. They hope to learn about right whale behavior, such as dive
   times and surface resting periods, in the calving grounds, and record
   behavioral changes and reactions when the pair comes close to large
   vessel traffic.

   The information collected from these efforts will provide the
   qualitative basis for determining when calving right whales are
   vulnerable to ship strikes, how whales react to passing vessels, and
   profiles of their daytime versus nighttime behaviors. Researchers can
   then use the data to advise the shipping industry on how minimize the
   likelihood of collisions.
