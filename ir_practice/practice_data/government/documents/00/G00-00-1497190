   Measuring emission rates of certain gasses from a swine lagoon. Testing
                    of bacteria in an anaerobic chamber.

   The mission of the Swine Odor and Manure Management Research Unit is to
    solve critical problems in the swine production industry that impact
       production efficiency, environmental quality, and human health.
    Multidisciplinary research teams generate and integrate knowledge for
    evaluation and development of new management practices that increase
   swine health, while minimizing nutrient excretion, production of odor,
      gaseous emissions, and release of pathogens into the environment.
