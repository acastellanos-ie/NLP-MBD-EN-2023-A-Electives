                         WELFARE TO WORK Highlights

     * THANK YOU to those organizations and individuals who submitted
       papers on "Lessons Learned Working with TANF." The Department of
       Labor appreciates the time and effort you have taken to assist us
       to inform the discussion on the upcoming reathorization of TANF
       from the perspective of the Welfare-to-Work experience.
     * WtW Performance and Reporting Tools Available to Grantees
       The Division of WtW has been working with Mathematica Policy
       Research, Inc. on a project to develop technical assistance tools
       related to WtW reporting, performance, and data validation. This
       project is comprised of three main components: (1) a reporting and
       performance technical specifications package, (2) reporting and
       performance software, and (3) a data elements validation guide. The
       audience for these two tools includes WtW grantee staff who are
       responsible for reporting and performance, programming, and
       management information system (MIS) functions. Additionally, these
       tools will assist grantee program management staff in performance
       analysis and planning. Grantee reporting and program staff, WtW
       monitors, and ETA WtW Grant Officer Technical Representatives
       (GOTRs) will find the forthcoming validation guide particularly
       useful.
       We recently released the reporting and performance technical
       specifications package and the reporting and performance software;
       the data elements validation guide will be released in December
       2001. To access a background piece on this project, and to download
       the technical specifications package and software, please click
