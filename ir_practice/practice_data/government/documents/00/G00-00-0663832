   Welcome to California's 1996 Primary Election Web Site!
   We are proud to provide you with up-to-the-minute election returns over
   the Internet. This year, we have also posted the California Ballot
   Pamphlet and other election-related information on the web to help
   voters make better informed decisions.

   We are currently working with the legislature to get campaign finance
   reports posted on our official Secretary of State Homepage. We hope to
   have this important information available during the 1998 elections.

   For the first time, we have joined forces with the non-partisan
   California Voter Foundation for the development of their 1996
   California On-Line Voter Guide. CVF's guide will help voters locate
   additional information about candidates and ballot measures that is not
   available through the Secretary of State's Office.

   This 1996 Primary Election Server is made possible through a
   public-private partnership between the Secretary of State's office and
   Digital Equipment Corporation. The project demonstrates the best of
   what happens when business and government work together to provide
   better service to the taxpayers. We hope you agree.

   Please, enjoy this unprecedented access to information regarding the
   California election, and remember to vote on Tuesday, March 26, 1996.
