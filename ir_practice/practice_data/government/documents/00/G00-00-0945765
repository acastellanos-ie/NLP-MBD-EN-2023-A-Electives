USGS Water Resources of Ohio

   The USGS manages water information at offices located throughout the
   United States. Although all offices are tied together through a
   Nationwide computer network, each collects data and conducts studies in
   a particular area. If you can't find the information you want at one
   site, we recommend checking neighboring sites, as study areas sometimes
   overlap.
