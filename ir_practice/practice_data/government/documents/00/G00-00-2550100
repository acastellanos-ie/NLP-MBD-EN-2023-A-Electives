   The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program is the largest global
   change research program supported by the U.S. Department of Energy
   (DOE). ARM scientists focus on obtaining field measurements and
   developing models to better understand the processes that control solar
   and thermal infrared radiative transfer in the atmosphere (especially
   in clouds) and at the earth's surface.
