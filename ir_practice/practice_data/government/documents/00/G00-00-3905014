           NIH Extramural Invention Information Management System

   Interagency Edison provides Federal grantee/contractor organizations
   and participating federal agencies with the technology to
   electronically manage extramural invention portfolios in compliance
   with federal reporting requirements.

   Interagency Edison was developed by the Office of Policy for Extramural
   Research Administration, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
   Maryland.

   What is Interagency Edison?

   Interagency Edison supports a "Common Face" for Invention Reporting to
   the Government. The system has been designed to facilitate
   grantee/contractor institutions with the compliance of laws and
   regulations mandated by the Bayh-Dole Act whose purpose is to ensure
   transfer of technology from the research laboratory to the
   commercial/public sector.

   Which Government agencies are participating in Interagency Edison?

   While it is the responsibility of grantee/contractor institutions to
   comply with the Bayh-Dole Act, as stewards of federal funds, and to
   provide assistance with compliance, Interagency Edison has been
   designed to streamline the invention reporting process mandated by the
   Code of Federal Regulations: 37CFR Part 401 with particular emphasis on
   the Standard Patent Rights Clauses, Section 401.14.
