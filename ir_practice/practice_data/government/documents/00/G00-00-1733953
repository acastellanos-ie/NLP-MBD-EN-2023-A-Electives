    The NIH Work and Family Life Center (WFLC) exists to help you balance
    the increasing demands of your work with your personal interests and
    responsibilities. Our goal is to increase employee wellbeing, thereby
    improving the quality of work and the quality of life at the NIH as a
                                   whole.

   The WFLC values a workplace in which employees are given the resources,
    flexibility, and trust they need to exercise personal responsibility
   and self-discipline in managing their careers and their personal lives.
        We view ourselves as change agents, and seek partnerships and
   collaboration that will make the National Institutes of Health a leader
                          in quality of work life.

   We believe that this emphasis on quality of work life will benefit the
     NIH as a whole by enhancing recruitment efforts and increasing job
     satisfaction, retention, and productivity in our current workforce.
