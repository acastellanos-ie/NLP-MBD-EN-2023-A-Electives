   T-2 Nuclear Information Service

   Welcome to the T-2 Nuclear Information Service. This service is run by
   Group T-16 (Nuclear Physics) of the Theoretical Division of the Los
   Alamos National Laboratory, which is operated by the University of
   California for the US Department of Energy. Group T-16 combines the old
   Groups T-2 and T-5, but we are keeping the name "T-2" on these pages
   for historical reasons. This section of the T-16 web site concentrates
   on nuclear modeling, nuclear data, cross sections, nuclear masses,
   ENDF, NJOY data processing, nuclear astrophysics, radioactivity,
   radiation shielding, data for medical radiotherapy, data for
   high-energy accelerator applications, data and codes for fission and
   fusion systems, and more.
