      The Chemistry of Health (requires free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view
      online) - NIH Pub. No. 00-4121, printed 2000, 66 pages

      This science education booklet describes how basic chemistry and
      biochemistry research can spur a better understanding of human health.
      The booklet highlights the research of a number of chemists and
      includes questions at the end of each chapter.

      Genetic Basics (requires free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view online) -
      NIH Pub. No. 01-662, printed 2001, 68 pages

      This science education brochure focuses on genetics, which is the study
      of how traits are transmitted from parents to offspring. The
      publication includes descriptions of how genes work, "strange but true"
      exceptions to the traditional rules of genetics, why basic research is
      important and worthwhile, some of the connections between genes and
      diseases, and the excitement of genetics research in the 21st century.

      Inside the Cell - NIH Pub. No. 97-1051, printed 1997, 55 pages

      The next big leap in medical science depends largely on how fast and
      how well scientists succeed in understanding the activity of the
      thousands of tiny organs in the living cell. This booklet describes
      discoveries about the cell that are leading scientists to develop new
      concepts of health and disease.

      Medicines By Design - NIH Pub. No. 93-474, printed 1993, 48 pages

      Today's pharmacologists are combining the techniques of genetic
      engineering and structural biology with such areas of science as
      biochemistry and natural product chemistry to design drugs that will
      treat disorders more efficiently and with fewer side effects. This
      brochure describes the history of pharmacology as well as some of the
      latest research developments in the field.

      Medicines for YOU - NIH Pub. No. 00-4657, printed 2000, 4-fold brochure

      Just like diet and lifestyle, genes can affect how people respond to
      medicines. This brochure (also available in Spanish, "Medicamentos Para
      Usted"), describes in lay language the science of pharmacogenetics, and
      answers questions about pharmacogenetics research.

      This full-color booklet, geared toward an advanced high school or early
      college-level audience, explains how structural biology provides
      insight into health and disease and is useful in developing new
      medications. The booklet features "Student Snapshots" designed to
      inspire young people to consider careers in biomedical research. It
      also includes review questions at the end of each chapter.
