     Sensitivity of Ground Water to Contamination in Lawrence County, SD
     __________________________________________________________________

   Growth in Lawrence County continues to increase both the demand and the
   potential for contamination of aquifers from agricultural, urban,
   suburban, commercial, and industrial land uses in Lawrence County. The
   U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with Lawrence County and the
   City of Spearfish, documented a study of sensitivity of ground water to
   contamination in Lawrence County in a Water-Resources Investigations
   Report (WRIR 00-4103). The report documents the method of analysis,
   limitations of the method, and results of the analysis.

   The study area was subdivided into sensitivity units that describe
   areas with a group of relative ratings of hydrogeologic
   characteristics, which can be compared to evaluate the potential for
   ground water to be contaminated. Sensitivity units were designated and
   delineated by sequentially evaluating six hydrogeologic
   characteristics: aquifer media, unsaturated media, hydraulic
   conductivity, recharge rate, depth to water, and land-surface slope.
   Plate 1 in the report shows the areal distribution of these sensitivity
   units with identifying codes.

   An additional mechanism of transport of potential contaminants is
   streamflow loss. Thus, the sensitivity of outcrops within loss zones
   also can be affected by conditions within drainage areas upstream from
   potential streamflow-loss zones. Drainage areas upstream from loss
   zones were delineated and described and are shown along with the
   associated loss zones on Plate 2 in the report.
