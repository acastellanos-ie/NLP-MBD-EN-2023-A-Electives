                          INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW
   Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are comets and asteroids that have been
   nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits
   that allow them to enter the Earth's neighborhood. Composed mostly of
   water ice with embedded dust particles, comets originally formed in the
   cold outer planetary system while most of the rocky asteroids formed in
   the warmer inner solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
   The scientific interest in comets and asteroids is due largely to their
   status as the relatively unchanged remnant debris from the solar system
   formation process some 4.6 billion years ago. The giant outer planets
   (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed from an agglomeration of
   billions of comets and the left over bits and pieces from this
   formation process are the comets we see today. Likewise, today's
   asteroids are the bits and pieces left over from the initial
   agglomeration of the inner planets that include Mercury, Venus, Earth,
   and Mars.

   As the primitive, leftover building blocks of the solar system
   formation process, comets and asteroids offer clues to the chemical
   mixture from which the planets formed some 4.6 billion years ago. If we
   wish to know the composition of the primordial mixture from which the
   planets formed, then we must determine the chemical constituents of the
   leftover debris from this formation process - the comets and asteroids.
