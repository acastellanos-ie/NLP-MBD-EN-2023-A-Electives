                                  Overview

       As more and more people around the world log onto the Internet,
     incidents of fraud continue to increase. Many of the fraud schemes
   already present in the "real" world can now be found on the Internet 
     fraudulent investment offerings, multi-level marketing schemes and
     failure-to-render scams (a favorite of unprincipled participants of
    online auctions). The crucial difference in fraud committed over the
   Internet is that the perpetrator can "virtually" vanish, pulling down a
    Web site in seconds, leaving consumers wondering who or where to turn
                                  for help.

   In response to this growing concern, the Federal Bureau of
   Investigation (FBI) and the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C)
   joined forces in a unique partnership to aid and protect consumers in
   this largely unregulated environment. The Internet Fraud Complaint
   Center (IFCC) is the result of that venture. Its Web site provides a
   mechanism for victims of Internet fraud to report fraud on-line  where
   it occurred  to the appropriate law enforcement and regulatory
   authorities.
