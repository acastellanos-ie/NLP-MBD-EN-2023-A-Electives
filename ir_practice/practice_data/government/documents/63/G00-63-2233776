   correction is required to compensate for the fragility of the state of
   a quantum computer. We report the first experimental implementations of
   quantum error correction and confirm the expected state stabilization.
   A precise analysis of the decay behavior is performed in alanine and a
   full implementation of the error correction procedure is realized in
   trichloroethylene. In NMR computing, however, a net improvement in the
   signal-to-noise would require very high polarization. The experiment
   implemented the 3-bit code for phase errors using liquid state state
   NMR. PACS numbers: 03.65.Bz, 89.70.+c,89.80.th,02.70.-c Quantum
   computers exploit the superposition principle to solve some problems
   much more efficiently than any known algorithm for their classical
   counterparts. These problems include factoring large numbers [1],
   combinatorial searching [2] and simulations of quantum systems [3-5].
   Exploiting the power of quantum computation was thought to be
   physically impossible due to the extreme fragility of quantum
   information [6,7]. This judgment seems to be overly pessimistic as
   quantum error-correction techniques [8-10] were found to protect
   quantum information against corruption. For physically reasonable
   models of decoherence a quantum computation can be as long as desired
   with arbitrarily accurate answers, provided the error rate is below a
   threshold value [11-14]. Thus decoherence and imprecision are no longer
   considered insurmountable obstacles to realizing a quantum computer.
   The chief remaining obstacle to quantum computing is the difficulty of
   finding suitable physical systems whose quantum states can be
   accurately controlled. Devices based on ion traps [15] have so far been
   limited to two bits [16]. Recently, liquid state NMR techniques have
   been shown to be capable of quantum computations with three bits
   [17,18]. Thus it is possible, for the first time, to implement the
   simplest quantum error-correcting codes, and so test these ideas in
   physical systems. In room temperature liquid state NMR, one can
   coherently manipulate the internal states of the coupled spin 12 nuclei
   in each of an ensemble of molecules subject to a large external
   magnetic field. Although the set of accessible states is highly mixed,
   it has been shown that experimental methods exist that can be used to
   isolate the pure state behavior of the system, thus permitting limited
   application of NMR to quantum computation [19,20]. A detailed
   description of these methods can be found in [21]. Here we describe the
   implementation of a quantum error-correcting code which compensates for
   small phase errors. The behavior of this code was measured for two
   systems: The 13C labeled carbons in alanine subject to the correlated
   phase errors induced by diffusion in a pulsed magnetic field gradient,
   and the proton and two labeled carbons in trichloroethylene (TCE)
   subject to its natural relaxation processes. In alanine, we observed
   correction of first-order errors using a precise analysis of the decay
   behavior of a given input state. The full error-correction procedure
   (including the final Toffoli gate) was implemented in TCE to
   demonstrate the expected state preservation of an arbitrary coherent
   input. Although our experiments validate the usefulness of error
   correction for quantum computing with pure states, there is a
   substantial loss of signal associated with the use of ancilla spins in
   weakly polarized systems. We argue that in this setting, the loss of
   signal involved in exploiting ancillas removes any advantage for
   computation gained by error correction, at least unless the system is
   sufficiently polarized to enable the generation of nearly pure states.
   Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate that error-correcting codes
   can be implemented, and that they behave as predicted. The simple
   three-bit quantum error-correcting code used here is designed to
   compensate to first order for small random phase fluctuations. These
   fluctuations constitute a random evolution of the state jb1b2b3i \Gamma
   ! e \Gamma i(`1oe1z+`2oe2z+`3oe3z)jb1b2b3i (1) = ei(( \Gamma
   1)b1`1+(\Gamma 1)b2`2+(\Gamma 1)b3`3)jb1b2b3i ; where bi is 0 or 1, `i
   is a random phase variable, and oeiz is the Pauli matrix acting on the
   i'th spin. The `i depend on the error rates in the model, which is
   described in detail below. The error-correcting code is a phase variant
   of the classical three bit majority code with a decoding technique that
   preserves the quantum information in the encoded state [9]. Let j\Sigma
   i = (j0i \Sigma j1i)=p2. The state (ffj000i + fij100i) is encoded as
   ffj + + +i + fij \Gamma \Gamma \Gamma i by a unitary transformation.
   The first-order expansion of the operator in Eq. (1) in the small
   random phases is 1 \Gamma i`1oe1z \Gamma i`2oe2z \Gamma i`3oe3z ; (2) 1
   which evolves the encoded state to ffj + + +i + fij \Gamma \Gamma
   \Gamma i ! ffj + + +i + fij \Gamma \Gamma \Gamma i (3)\Gamma i`1(ffj
   \Gamma + +i + fij + \Gamma \Gamma i)\Gamma i`2(ffj + \Gamma +i + fij
   \Gamma + \Gamma i)\Gamma i`3(ffj + + \Gamma i + fij \Gamma \Gamma +i) :
   The different errors map the encoded state into orthogonal subspaces.
   By measuring the two observables oe1zoe3z and oe2zoe3z the subspace can
   be identified. Thus one can determine which error occurred without
   destroying the encoded quantum information. After decoding, the
   original state of the first spin can then be restored by a unitary
   transformation, while the other two spins contain information (the
   syndrome) about the error which occurred. A network which accomplishes
   the encoding, decoding and error-correction steps is shown in Figure 1.
   In NMR experiments, non-unitary processes are classified as
   spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation [23,24]. For spin 12 nuclei, both
   processes are due to fluctuating local magnetic fields. The three spin
   code corrects for errors due to locally fluctuating fields along the z
   axis. We focus on a weakly coupled three-spin system where the
   strongest contribution to coherence loss is from external fields which
   contribute the Hamiltonian HR j fl1I1 \Delta B1(t) + fl2I2 \Delta B2(t)
   + fl3I3 \Delta B3(t) ; (4) where I = (Ix; Iy; Iz) and Iu = 12 oeu (u =
   x; y; z). The x and y components of the external fields do not
   contribute significantly to loss of coherence in our experiments. The
   induced random phase fluctuations are identical to those described in
   Eq. (1). As a result, the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix
   decay exponentially at a rate which depends on the fields Bk at each
   spin, their gyromagnetic ratios flk, the coherence order and the zero
   frequency components of the spectral densities of the fields. The
   "coherence order" is the difference between the total angular momenta
   along the z-axis of the two states jbi,j b0i (in units of _h=2) which
   define a matrix element jb0ihbj [25]. To obtain a clean demonstration
   of error correction, a simple error model was implemented precisely in
   the case of alanine. This implementation used the random molecular
   motion induced by diffusion in a constant field gradient to mimic the
   effect of a slowly varying random field. This is achieved by turning on
   an external field gradient rzB = @Bz=@z across the sample for a time
   ffi. This modifies the magnetization in the sample with a phase varying
   linearly along the z direction according to @OE=@z = nffifl@Bz=@z,
   where n is the coherence order of the density matrix element and fl is
   the gyromagnetic ratio. A reverse gradient is used to refocus the
   magnetization after allowing molecular diffusion to take place for
   amount of time t. As a result of random spin displacement \Delta z, the
   phases of the spins are not returned to their original values but are
   randomly modified by (nffifl@Bz=@z)\Delta z. For a Gaussian
   displacement profile with a width of p2Dt, the effective decoherence
   time of this process is proportional to the diffusion constant D as
   well as to the square of the coherence order n [25]: 1 o/ = ` @OE @z '
   2 D = fl2(rzB)2n2ffi2D : (5) This artificially induced "decoherence" in
   the alanine experiments is an example of completely correlated phase
   scrambling. This occurs naturally if all the spins have equal
   gyromagnetic ratios in the slow motion regime. We used TCE to
   demonstrate error-correction in the presence of the natural
   decoherence. Most NMR experiments are described using the product
   operator formalism [26]. This formalism describes the state as a sum of
   products of the operators Ikx, Iky, Ikz . The identity component of
   such a sum is the same for any state and is usually suppressed to yield
   the "deviation" (traceless) density matrix. The effect of
   error-correction can be understood from the point of view of this
   formalism. As an example, consider encoding the state I1z using two
   ancillas initially in their ground states. The initial state is
   described by aeA = I1z( 12 1 + I2z)( 12 1 + I3z): (6) After encoding
   the state is aeB j 14 \Gamma I1x + I2x + I3x + 4 I1xI2xI3x\Delta : (7)
   In the case of completely correlated phase errors, this decays as aeC j
   14 i\Gamma I1x + I2x + I3x\Delta e \Gamma t=o/ (8) + \Gamma 3I1xI2xI3x
   + I1xI2yI3y + I1yI2xI3y + I1yI2yI3x\Delta e \Gamma t=o/ + \Gamma
   I1xI2xI3x \Gamma I1xI2yI3y \Gamma I1yI2xI3y \Gamma I1yI2yI3x\Delta e
   \Gamma 9t=o/ j : Decoding and error correction mixes these states
   together so as to cancel the initial decay of the first spin, ae1E j 18
   I1z(9e \Gamma t=o/ \Gamma e\Gamma 9t=o/ ) ss I1z(1 \Gamma 9 2 t 2=o/2 +
   \Delta \Delta \Delta ) : (9) The effect of error correction can be seen
   from the absence of terms depending linearly on t. In the alanine
   experiments, each of the four product operators in the sum of Eq. 6 was
   realized in a separate experiment, and the final state after encoding
   and decoding inferred by adding the results. The loss of polarization
   over time in each product operator was measured explicitly in each
   experiment. The results were added computationally to simulate the
   effect of the Toffoli gate and are shown in Figure 2. This method has
   the advantage of permitting a detailed analysis of the relevant
   relaxation pathways. The initial slopes of the decay curves for each
   operator were estimated and added as required 2 for error correction.
   The resulting slope is zero within experimental errors. Thus the net
   curve has quadratic behavior for small delays. The goal of our
   experiments with TCE was to establish the behavior of encoding/decoding
   and error correction on all possible initial states subject to the
   natural decoherence and dephasing. The spins were prepared in the
   states ae( 12 1 + I2z)( 12 1 + I3z); (10) with ae one of the four
   inputs 12 1, I1z, I1x, I1y. Any possible input is just a linear
   combination of these four states. We used gradient methods to directly
   generate the four states of Eq. 10. They were then subjected to pulse
   sequences for encoding, decoherence and decoding (experiment I). The
   reduced density matrix on the first spin (the output) was measured. In
   the second experiment (II) decoding was followed by error correction
   (i.e. physical implementation of the Toffoli gate so that the whole
   circuit of Fig.1 was implemented) before the output was determined.
   Decoherence was implemented in two ways. The first involved a variable
   delay during which natural dephasing takes place. In the second
   implementation, we inserted pulses for each possible phase error (sign
   flips on at most one spin). Pulse sequences can be found in [27].
   Ideally the output would be identical to the input. The measured
   outputs were compared to the ideal ones by computing the "entanglement
   fidelity" [28]. This is a useful measure of how well the quantum
   information in the input is preserved. Entanglement fidelity is the sum
   of the correct polarization left in the output state for each input.
   More precisely, given input I1a, let fa be the relative polarization of
   I1a in the output compared to the input. Then f = 14 (1 + fx + fy +
   fz), this formula is correct for processes which do not affect the
   completely mixed state 12 1. The results for nine different delays are
   shown in Figure 3. The curves show that error correction decreases the
   initial slope by a factor of , 10 (by square fit to the logarithm). Our
   demonstration of error-correction does not imply that error-correction
   can be used to overcome the problems of high temperature ensemble
   quantum computing. In this model of quantum computing, the initial
   state can be described as a small, linear deviation from the infinite
   temperature equilibrium. Thus, the deviation is proportional to a
   Hamiltonian of n weakly interacting particles. In this limit no method
   of error-correction based on externally applied, time dependent fields
   can improve the polarization of any particle by more than a factor
   proportional to pn [29]. If one wishes to use error-correction an even
   bigger problem is encountered: The initial state of the ancillas used
   for each encoding/decoding cycle must be pure. In the high temperature
   regime, the best we can do is to generate a pseudo pure deviation in
   the ancillas. Unfortunately, this deviation has to be created
   simultaneously on all ancillas, leading to an exponential reduction in
   polarization as a function of the total number of ancillas required
   [30]. This reduction in polarization is not recoverable by error
   correction. In fact, further analysis shows that an initial
   polarization of order unity is required for error correction to yield a
   net gain. Another problem is the inability to reuse ancilla bits. This
   has two consequences. The first is that decoherence rapidly removes
   information in the state, leading to computations which are
   logarithmically bounded in time [31]. Second, the total number of
   ancillas required is proportional to the time-space product of the
   computation, rather than to a power of its logarithm. Our work shows
   that liquid state NMR can be used to test fundamental ideas in quantum
   computing. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time the state
   preserving effect of the three bit phase error-correcting code. The
   first-order behavior was established to high accuracy for a specific
   state in alanine, while the overall effect was observed and the
   improvement in state recovery verified in TCE. These experiments
   confirm not only the validity of theories of quantum error correction
   in a simple case, but also demonstrate the ability, in liquid state
   NMR, to control the state of three spin-half particles. This is an
   important advance for quantum computing, as this is the first system
   where this degree of control has been successfully implemented.

   Differences between experimental and theoretical curves are attributed
   to lack of precise knowledge of the error model. Errors in the data
   points are approximately 0:05. Note that since the proton T2 is much
   longer than that of the carbons, the long term gain in fidelity is
   partially due to recovery of polarization from the proton. The
   demonstration of error correction lies in the initial slope. The curves
   show that error correction decreases the initial slope by a factor of ,
   10 (by least square fit to the logarithm). 5
