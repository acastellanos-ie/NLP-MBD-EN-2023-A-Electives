   Complaint Information

   I am unhappy about something my doctor did or didn't do.  Is there
   anything the Medical Board can do about it?
   The Medical Board is responsible for investigating complaints and
   disciplining physicians who violate the law.  If a doctor or other
   Board licensee violates the laws that apply to the practice of
   medicine, Board staff will investigate and may file appropriate
   charges.  Staff can investigate the following types of issues:
     * the quality of care and treatment provided by a physician (e.g.
       negligence)
     * violation of drug laws or misprescribing
     * substance abuse by the physician
     * sexual misconduct by the physician
     * dishonesty (including filing fraudulent insurance / Medi-Cal /
       Medicare claims)
     * practice of medicine by an unlicensed person

   In addition to physicians, the Board also investigates complaints about
   and takes appropriate disciplinary action, against:
     * registered dispensing opticians
     * research psychoanalysts
     * midwives

   Further, the Board also investigates complaints about licensees in the
   following professions; however, the disciplinary action is taken by the
   respective licensing entity.
     * Doctors of Podiatric Medicine
     * Physician Assistants
     * Psychologists
     * Psychological Assistants
