               EASTIN SUPPORTS NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK
                                IN CALIFORNIA

        SACRAMENTO-State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine
   Eastin issued the following statement in recognition of February 4-8,
   2002 as National School Counseling Week:

        "I urge Californians to take time during this week to acknowledge
   school counselors for the tremendous impact they can have in helping
   students achieve academic success and plan for a career. School
   counselors work as an integral part of the school team of teachers,
   parents, and administrators in enabling all students to achieve success
   in school, and to become responsible and productive members of society.
        "National School Counseling Week, February 4-8, 2002, provides
   recognition for school counselors who implement comprehensive school
   counseling programs, a vital part of the educational process for all
   students as they meet the challenges of the 21st century. In addressing
   such areas as student achievement, crisis response, and career
   planning, school counselors have played a critical role in early
   intervention and prevention through counseling and guidance programs
   that provide direct services to students and their families.
        "Schools across California and the nation celebrate National
   School Counseling Week each year with a variety of activities, focusing
   on student achievement, safe schools, multiculturalism, human rights,
   parent and family involvement, child advocacy, community collaborations
   and partnerships, and professional renewal. As all educators focus
   their efforts on improved academic achievement of students, it is
   important that we recognize school counselors for their continuing
   efforts in reducing barriers to learning and in providing the support
   necessary for all students to achieve at the highest level possible.
        "It's time that every student in California receives the academic,
   career, and personal/social benefits of an effective school counseling
   program. California schools, however, still suffer from the worst
   student-to-counselor ratio in the nation. The 2000-2001
   student-to-counselor ratio in California is 945-to-1, significantly
   higher than the national average of 490-to-1. I encourage the media to
   join with local communities in publicizing the important role that
   school counselors play in California's schools, and the need for all
   students to have access to the important programs and services that
   counselors provide."

   (pmeyers@cde.ca.gov), consultant in the California Department of
   Education's Counseling and Student Support Services Unit, at

       Special Report!
   CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CHALLENGE  (January 18, 2001)
   California continues to experience electrical shortages and rolling
   blackouts throughout the State. To reduce the risk of power outages,
   the most important thing we can do in the short term is reduce our
   demand for electricity and use energy more efficiently. ....We realize
   that many school districts already utilize energy efficient strategies
   and may plan to increase their energy efficiency efforts given the
   current situation. CDE has established a web site at:
   http://www.cde.ca.gov/facilities/energyefficiency to share your "best
   practices" energy efficiency strategies with all school districts in
   the state.
