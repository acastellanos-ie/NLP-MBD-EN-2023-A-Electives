   The Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program tracks the status and
   distribution of introduced aquatic organisms and provides this
   information in a timely manner for research, management and education.

   Asian Swamp Eel (Monopterus sp.) - click to enlarge Nonindigenous
   species are ranked second only to habitat loss in the factors that
   threaten native biodiversity, however the geographic distribution of
   many of these organisms are poorly understood.  As new taxa are
   introduced and the range of those previously established continues to
   increase, precise tracking of their status and distribution is
   imperative for decision making and resource management.

   There are two programs at the Florida Caribbean Science Center that
   compliment each other.  The nonindigenous fishes program conducts field
   and laboratory studies.  The other program (NAS) is developing a
   database on all nonindigenous aquatic species.
   Giant Salvinia (Salvinia molesta) - click to enlarge Invasive
   nonindigenous species are important because they threaten native
   communities, alter habitats, and can have significant economic impacts.
   In aquatic environments, invasive species can be especially noxious
   because native species have few options for escaping direct
   interactions such as predation and competition for habitat and food.
