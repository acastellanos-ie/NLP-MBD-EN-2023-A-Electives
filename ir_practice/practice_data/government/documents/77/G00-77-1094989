                  FDA/CFSAN Privacy Policy and Disclaimers

     Thank you for visiting the FDA/CFSAN web site and for reviewing our
     Privacy Policy. Please note that:

     We collect no information about you, other than information
     automatically collected and stored (see below), when you visit our
     web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

Privacy Policy for The FDA/CFSAN VM Web Site

   Information Collected and Stored Automatically
       When you visit the "vm.cfsan.fda.gov" (aka "www.cfsan.fda.gov") web
       site, if you do nothing during your visit but browse through the
       web site, read pages, or download information, we will gather and
       store certain information about your visit automatically. This
       information does not identify you personally. We automatically
       collect and store only the following aggregated general information
       about your visit:
          + the pages you visit,
          + the date and time you access our site,
          + the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
            example, aol.com, if you are coming from an America Online
            account, or purdue.edu if you are connecting from Purdue
            University's domain),
          + the Internet address of the website from which you linked
            directly to our site, and
          + your operating system and browser.
       We use this information
          + to measure the number of visitors to the different food and
            nutrition sections of our site,
          + to help us make our site more useful
          + to develop and code content pages so that most people will be
            able to view the pages correctly.
       If You Send Us Personal Information
       If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an
       e-mail message or by filling out a form, we store the question and
       e-mail address information so that we can answer the question that
       was sent in, and send the answer back to the e-mail or other
       address or phone provided. If you send us a comment, we relay the
       comment to the most appropriate program manager in the agency. If
       enough questions or comments come in that are the same, the
       question may be added to our Question and Answer section, or the
       suggestions may be used to guide the design of our Web site. Unless
       otherwise required by statute, we do not identify publicly who
       sends questions or comments into our web site.
       Children's Privacy
       We collect no information from children under 13. If a child sends
       us an e-mail inquiry or comment, we answer, then delete the e-mail
       from our files.
       CFSAN Listservs
       If you subscribe to a CFSAN Listserv, CFSAN considers your e-mail
       address confidential and it will not be released under FOI. For
       your convenience, you can subscribe to other government and
       non-government Listservs from our site. Each Listserv has its own
       privacy policy which you should check prior to subscribing.

Disclosure

       FDA does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal
       information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement
       or by statute. We will only use personally identifying information
       to respond to you or to help us perform our public health duties.
       In those cases, various people may see the personal information you
       provide in order to look into the matter you inquired about.
       We may enter the information you send into an electronic database,
       to share with our attorneys and investigators involved in law
       enforcement or policy-making. We may also share it with other
       government agencies that have public health or consumer protection
       duties. FDA or any of those agencies may contact you. In other
       limited circumstances, including requests from Congress or private
       individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you
       submit.
       Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If you
       are worried because your communication is very sensitive, or
       includes personal information such as your social security number,
       you can send it by postal mail instead.
