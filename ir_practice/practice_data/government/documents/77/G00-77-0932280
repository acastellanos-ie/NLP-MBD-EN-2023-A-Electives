   Safety Subgroups are formed to address software related issues that
   need specific attention throughout NASA. The subgroups will exist until
   the issues are resolved to the Software Working Group's satisfaction,
   and new Subgroups will form when new issues arise. Currently, the SWG
   has three active subgroups.
