   What we do:
   The Department of Transportation has the discretionary authority to
   issue special permits for the movement of vehicles/loads exceeding
   statutory limitations on the size, weight, and loading of vehicles
   contained in Division 15 of the California Vehicle Code. Requests for
   such special permits requires the completion of and application for a
   Transportation Permit.

   The Transportation Permits Branch is responsible for the administration
   of the Transportation Permit program through the uniform issuance of
   Transportation Permits.
