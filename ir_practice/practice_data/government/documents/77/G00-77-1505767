   Pursuant to Public Law 105-119, the undersigned members of the U.S.
   Census Monitoring Board (CMB) hereby transmit our final report to
   Congress.

   The following report represents over three years of dedicated service
   to the cause of an accurate Census 2000. It embodies not only our
   legacy, but also our belief that the census, as a foundation of
   democracy, should count every single individual in our great nation. It
   is also our hope that this final report will serve as a useful roadmap
   for Census 2010.
