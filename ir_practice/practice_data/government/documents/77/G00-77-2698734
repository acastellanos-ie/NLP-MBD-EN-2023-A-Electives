   Info:

   Compound Carts are collections of compounds from the DTP database which
   can be analyzed as a unit using the tools available on the 3d MIND web
   site. Compound Carts are only available to the user who created the
   carts. Carts persist for 24 hours after the user leaves the 3d MIND web
   site (for permanent storage, please use 'Save' cart option described
   below.)

   Two kinds of carts are available for analysis.
    1. "NSC Number" carts store the NSC Number for the compound (default
       option). In some cases, the same compound has been tested multiple
       times by the DTP over different concentration ranges. Each test
       represents a different data vector in the SOM. Analyses of these
       carts will automatically include all data vectors present in the
       database.
    2. "Data Vector" carts store the individual data vectors and thus
       allow the User to pick and choose specific data vectors of
       interest.

   The following functionality is available for working with Compound
   Carts:
     * Create carts using the "Add to Cart" link on pages that display
       compounds from the DTP or add the compounds to an existing cart;
     * "Save" carts to a local text file and then "Restore" the carts for
       reanalysis at a later time;
     * "Copy/Extract" allows the User to create new carts by duplication
       or by extracting a subset of the NSC Numbers/Data Vectors from the
       designated cart. Convert a cart from NSC Number to Data Vector and
       vice versa.
     * Users can "Combine" carts by taking the UNION or INTERSECTION of
       any two existing carts. A cart can also be subtracted from another
       cart using the MINUS operation.
