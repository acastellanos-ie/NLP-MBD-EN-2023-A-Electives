   [bullet.gif] Section B. Information Collected and How it is Used

   What information we collect if you only browse this site.
   If you do nothing during your visit to our web site but browse, read
   pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit. This information does not identify you
   personally. We automatically collect and store the following
   information about your visit:

    1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet
       Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your
       Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the
       Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This
       address can be translated to determine the domain name of your
       service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu);
    2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
    3. The date and time you visited this site;
    4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and
    5. The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site.

   The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by
   General Administration only to improve the content of our web services
   and to help us understand how people are using our services. General
   Administration analyzes this information to determine how our web site
   is being used, so that we may continually improve the site's usefulness
   to the public.

   What information we collect if you volunteer it.
   If during your visit to our web site you participate in a survey, send
   an email, or perform some other transaction online, the following
   additional information will be collected:

    1. The email address, and contents of email, for those who communicate
       with us via email.
    2. Information volunteered through an online form for any other
       purpose.

   We use your email to respond directly to you, to address issues you
   identify in your email, to further improve our web site, or to forward
   to another agency for appropriate action.  Information from an online
   form is used to respond directly to you to address issues you have
   identified, to forward information to other agencies for response or to
   understand how people are using our services.

   [bullet.gif] Section C. Personal Information and Choice
   You may choose whether to provide personal information online.

   "Personal information" is information about a natural person that is
   readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information
   includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone
   number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered
   personal information.

   We do not collect personal information about you unless you voluntarily
   provide it to us by sending us email, participate in a survey, or
   complete an online form. You may choose not to contact us by email,
   participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an
   online form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will
   not impair your ability to browse www.ga.wa.gov and read or download
   certain information provided on the site, with the exceptions noted
   below.
     * Bid Documents.  Vendor information is requested prior to viewing
       bid documents.  If you choose not to provide information to browse
       online bid documents, you can request hard copies by contacting the
       Office of State Procurement at (360) 902-7400.  You may also view
       information in person at  our office located at: General
       Administration Building, Room 201, Olympia, WA 98504-1017.

   If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by
   the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.
   However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and
   may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
   state or federal law.

   If you believe that your personal/private information is being used for
   a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact
   the Public Information Officer as shown in the Contact Information
   Section of this statement.

   Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information
   requested from or volunteered by children online or by email will be
   treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject
   to public access.
   [bullet.gif] Section D. Public Access to Information
   In Washington, laws exist to ensure that state government is open and
   that the public has a right to access appropriate records and
   information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are
   exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve
   various needs, including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are
   provided by both state and federal laws.

   All of the information collected at this site becomes public record
   that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public,
   unless an exemption in law exists. The provisions of RCW 42.17. 260(1)
   state that

     Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make
     available for public inspection and copying all public records,
     unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection
     (6) of this section, RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute
     which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or
     records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion
     of personal privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and
     42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner
     consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available
     or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the
     justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.

   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public
   Records Act or other law governing the agencyâ€™s disclosure of records,
   the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.

   [bullet.gif] Section E. Nondisclosure of Certain Personal Information
   General Administration may require you to provide certain personal
   information.  The information is required in order to understand who
   uses our services and keep you informed about bid opportunities and
   important changes.

   You may choose not to provide this information, but if you choose not
   to provide it, we will be unable to contact you in the event of a
   contract change or bid opportunity, and you will have to obtain this
   information in person or by mail.

   The following laws may prevent General Administration from disclosing
   personal information about you:
     * For general exemptions, RCW 42.17.310
     * For tort claims, RCWs 4.92.210(2) and 43.19.19368(3)

   [bullet.gif] Section F. Review and Correction of Personally
   Identifiable Information
   You can review any personally identifiable information we collect about
   you by using the information in the Contact Information section at the
   end of this Notice. You may recommend changes to your personally
   identifiable information you believe to be inaccurate by submitting a
   written request that credibly shows the inaccuracy.  We will take
   reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or
   making corrections. (RCW 43.105.310)

   [bullet.gif] Section G. Security
   General Administration, as developer and manager of www.ga.wa.gov, has

   and information, and to provide reasonable protection of private
   information in our possession.
