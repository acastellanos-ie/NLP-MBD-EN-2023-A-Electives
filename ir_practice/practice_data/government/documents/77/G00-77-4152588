   The purpose of the Microgravity Glovebox Flight program is to provide a
   sealed volume and ancillary equipment and services for performing
   crew-operated and/or teleoperated investigations which require
   isolation from the vehicle environment.

   The objectives of the Glovebox Program are to:
     * Provide facilities for performing investigations which do not
       require large, specialized equipment
     * Provide quick response, lower cost access to space for
       proof-of-concept/demonstration investigations
     * Provide investigation hardware development and investigation
       integration services
     * Allow investigators to concentrate on science development rather
       than open facility development and vehicle/mission issues

   The customers of the Microgravity Glovebox Program are:
     * Microgravity Science and Applications Division (MSAD) Science
     * Discipline Community
          + Biotechnology/Protein Crystal Growth
          + Combustion Physics
          + Fluid Physics
          + Low-Temperature Physics
          + Materials Science
