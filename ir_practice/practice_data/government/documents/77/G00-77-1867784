   News and Events
   December 27, 2001 Department of Energy Solicits Recommendations for
   Microbial Sequencing Targets The DoE is seeking nominations of microbes
   and microbial communities as candidates for draft genomic sequencing in
   support of the DoE's Microbial Genome and the Genomes to Life Programs.
   To find out how to nominate a microbe for sequencing, click here.
   Deadline March 28, 2002.

   October 25 , 2001 Gene-Rich Pufferfish DNA Decoded An international
   research consortium has taken a substantial short cut to the
   biologically important information embedded in the human genome with
   the completion of a draft sequence of the genome of the Japanese
   pufferfish Fugu rubripes. The Fugu draft sequence will be announced at
   the 13th International Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference in San
   Diego, California on October 26th.
