   [Glaesner.jpg] [thebeach.gif]              [tubes.jpg]
   COMLARA County Park offers a unique swimming beach, or what we like to
   call a natural water play park. Completely separated from the lake
   proper, 2.5 acres of water and 4 acres of sand beach and sun bathing
   area provide the perfect setting for swimming, beach volleyball and
   other summer fun.

   Glasener Beach also offers a giant water umbrella, a diving platform,
   and Lazy Lagoon Areas with float tubes that are perfect for a relaxing
   swim.
   The Pirate Cove play area includes a playground with a slide, climbing
   net, and other play features right on the beach.

   [diswhlchrbrown.GIF] Glasener Beach provides a concrete ramp/railing
