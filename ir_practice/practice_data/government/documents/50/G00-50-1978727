   Our Goals and Objectives provide direction for our Enterprise programs.
   They reach out beyond what can be accomplished today, stretching the
   imagination. They force us to think of new technologies, new systems
   and new models for air and space transportation operations. Our Goals
   and Objectives are written as outcomes, to serve as a constant reminder
   that we must work with our industry and FAA partners to ensure that our
   technologies are implemented.

          Goals and Objectives Chart

   Goal 1: Revolutionize Aviation
   Enable a safe environmentally-friendly expansion of aviation.
   (Baseline: 1997)

   Objective 1: Increase Safety
   Reduce the aircraft accident rate by a factor of five within 10 years,
   and by a factor of 10 within 25 years.

   Objective 2: Reduce Emissions
   Reduce NOX emissions of future aircraft by 70% within 10 years, and by
   80% within 25 years (Baseline: 1996 ICAO Standards) and CO2 emissions
   by 25% and by 50% in the same timeframes.

   Objective 3: Reduce Noise
   Reduce the perceived noise of future aircraft by a factor of two within
   10 years, and by a factor of four within 25 years.

   Objective 4: Increase Capacity
   Double the aviation system capacity within 10 years, and triple it
   within 25 years.

   Objective 5: Increase Mobility
   Reduce inter-city door-to-door transportation time by half in 10 years
   and by two-thirds in 25 years and reduce long-haul transcontinental
   travel time by half within 25 years.

   Goal 2: Advance Space Transportation
   Create a safe, affordable highway through the air and into space.
   (Baseline: 2000)

   Objective 6: Mission Safety
   Reduce the incidence of crew loss by a factor of 40 within 10 years,
   and an additional factor of 100 within 25 years.

   Objective 7: Mission Affordability
   Reduce the cost of delivering payload to LEO by a factor of 10 within
   10 years, the cost of interorbital transfer by a factor of 10 within 15
   years. Reduce costs for both by an additional factor of 10 within 25
   years.

   Objective 8: Mission Reach
   Reduce the time for planetary missions by a factor of two within 15
   years, and by a factor of 10 within 25 years.
