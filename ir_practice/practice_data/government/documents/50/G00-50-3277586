   ORIGIN OF THE COURT

   Kentucky acquired a federal court in 1789, two and one-half years
   before it achieved statehood and while it was the western district of
   Virginia. The Judiciary Act of 1789 enabled the first judge, Judge
   Harry Innes, to take the oath of office on December 15, 1789, under a
   Commission from President George Washington. Kentucky remained a one
   district court until February 12, 1901. Eight District Judges served
   the District of Kentucky Court from 1789 to 1900. In February, 1901,
   Congress passed an Act dividing Kentucky into two judicial districts -
   the Eastern and Western. The Eastern District consists of 67 counties
   served by twelve District Judges from 1901 to present.
