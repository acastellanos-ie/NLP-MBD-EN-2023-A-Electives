                               About The Mint


   Since Congress created the United States Mint on April 2, 1792, it has
   grown to a Fortune 500-sized manufacturing and international marketing
   enterprise with more than $3.7 billion in annual revenues and 2,800
   employees; and is the world's largest manufacturer of coins, medals,
   and coin-based consumer products.

   Mission

   The primary mission of the U.S. Mint is to produce an adequate volume
   of circulating coinage for the nation to conduct its trade and
   commerce. Historically, circulating coin production has varied between
   14 and 20 billion coins annually. In addition to producing coins, the
   U.S. Mint has other responsibilities, including:
     * Distributing U.S. coins to the Federal Reserve banks and branches.
     * Maintaining physical custody and protection of the Nation's $100
       billion of U.S. gold and silver assets.
     * Producing proof and uncirculated coins, commemorative coins, and
       medals for sale to the general public.
     * Manufacturing and selling platinum, gold, and silver bullion coins.
     * Oversight of production facilities in Denver, Philadelphia, San
       Francisco and West Point, N.Y., as well as the U.S. Bullion
       Depository at Ft. Knox, Kentucky.
     * Receiving, redeeming, and processing mutilated coins.
