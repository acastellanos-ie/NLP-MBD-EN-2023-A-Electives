     __________________________________________________________________

    April 5, 1995:

   During the February shutdown, the Gammasphere data acquisition system
   was installed and debugged. Together with the new support stand
   installed last October, this completes the transition from the Early
   Implementation configuration to the final Gammasphere configuration.
   The new data acquisition system consists of Ge and BGO electronics on
   VXI boards, single board computers in VME crates for data processing,
   and workstations for online data analysis. Each VXI board contains two
   complete Ge-BGO channels of electronics, which include circuits for
   pulse shaping, timing, ADCs, TDCs and control logic. The digitized
   signals are transmitted via an optical link to the VME processors
   located in the counting room. The VME processors perform energy and
   time calibrations, as well as event filtering and formatting. Data can
   be written to eight 8mm tapes simultaneously and also sent to
   workstations through the network. The system was designed and
   constructed at LBL with contributions from ANL and ORNL.

   Since March 8, four experiments have been carried out successfully with
   about 55 detectors in the array. New detectors are being added to the
   array as they arrive from the vendor and around October 95 all 110
   detectors are expected to be in operation. Work on the data interface
   for auxiliary detectors is proceeding and is expected to be completed
   during May or June 95. No further shutdowns associated with Gammasphere
   implementation are anticipated at this time.

    May 11, 1995:

   As you are aware, the deadline for proposals to run at the 88-inch
   Cyclotron is May 22nd. With this in mind we enclose a brief update of
   the status of GAMMASPHERE for your information.

   Installation of the VXI electronics was completed at the end of
   February. Since then 9 GAMMASPHERE experiments have been successfully
   run.

   Detectors: Currently running 56 (including 18 segmented)

   Electronics: At present time we are able to trigger only on the clean
   Ge.

   Data Acq.: For all runs the data to tape has consisted of the following
   parameters;

   Ge ID (adc number)

   Ge Energy (5MeV full scale @ 1/3 keV/chan)

   Ge Time

   Ge Side Channel

   Ge Energy (20MeV full scale)

   Ge Trap Corrector

   Before writing to tape Ge energies can be Doppler corrected and their
   times aligned.

   Other event format options are available.

   Tapes: With this format the tapes are run at less than 500 kBytes/sec
   and this enables simultaneous copy to 2 tapes. A typical experiment (4
   days) requires 30-40 tapes per copy.

   Performance: Average Peak to Total = 0.57 for 60Co

   Average Resolution (1.3MeV) = 2.7 keV

   Rates: As an example, in a Rare Earth Compound Nucleus Reaction :-

   Trigger Condition of Clean Ge Fold = 5

   Beam = 2pnA

   Target thickness = 1mg/cm**2

   Ge (forward) = 10K

   Master Trigger Rate = 4 -> 5K
