                            Vendor Presentations

    To promote the Small and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprise (DVBE)
       program in State Government, Teale sponsors a series of monthly
    presentations at which vendors provide an overview of their products
       and services. Procurement and technical staff, as well as Small
    Business/DVBE Advocates/Liaisons from state agencies, are invited to
                     attend these informative sessions.

       Teale and the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency have
    partnered with the California Department of Veterans Affairs to host
   these presentations at this new location with seating for approximately
                                 85 persons.
