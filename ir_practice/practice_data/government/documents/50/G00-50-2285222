   The TIDE/PSI investigation is designed to obtain mass-resolved
   observations of the velocity distribution of plasmas in the
   magnetosphere, especially the polar regions. This includes the partial
   pressure, wind velocity and temperature of the principal ion species
   whose source lies in the terrestrial atmosphere and ionosphere, i.e.
   Hydrogen, Helium, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and molecules of these species and
   their compounds. Features of interest include the heating and outflow
   of terrestrial plasma into the magnetosphere, the circulation of this
   plasma within the magnetosphere, its acceleration by space storm
   processes, and the escape of terrestrial plasma out of the
   magnetosphere into the passing solar wind. TIDE and PSI have been
   operational onboard the POLAR satellite since early March, 1996.
