                       Gate Passes For Non-LBL Employees

   If you are not an LBL employee, you will need to stop at the main
   entrance gate (Blackberry Gate) on the first day of camp, and get a
   pass for the week that will allow you to enter the lab and park in
   general parking. If the guard does not have your pass, please have
   him/her call one of the SEC Board members at x7326 or x5252.

                             Sign-in/Sign-out Sheet

   One of the counselors or volunteer parents will carry the
   sign-in/sign-out sheet at all times. When you leave your child at camp,
   take your child out to lunch, or pick them up at the end of the day,
   you MUST ALWAYS sign them in or out. This is for your child's safety.
   If someone else will be picking up your child, you must leave written
   authorization with the counselors. There is a comment column on the
   sign-in sheet for any special instructions that you may want us to know
   about with regard to your child for that day (e.g. special medication,
   different telephone number for the day).

                                    Drop-off

   Drop-off hours are 7:45AM-9:00AM in the lower cafeteria. Please make
   every effort to bring your child(ren) no later than 9:00AM so that they
   can start the morning program with the rest of us. Remember, you must
   sign the sign-in sheet when you drop-off your child, and indicate the
   expected pick-up time.

                                    Pick-up

   The children will return to the Lab by 4PM and can be picked up from
   the Lower cafeteria between 4PM-5:15PM. Please be considerate of the
   staff and pick up your child no later then 5:15PM. We have a standard
   daycare procedure and charge $1.00 per minute that your child is here
   past 5:15PM. The late charge must be paid with a check payable to SEC
   upon picking up your child.
   Remember to sign your child out. If someone else is picking up your
   child, they need written permission from you.

                                   Lunch Hour

   The children will arrive at the lower cafeteria for lunch at 12:00
   noon. Children whose parents do not meet them for lunch will either eat
   in the lower cafeteria or on the grass near the picnic tables. Since we
   are monopolizing the lower cafeteria for our six week camp, we ask that
   only children eating with their parents use the picnic tables. For
   those of you who bring their lunch, please pack a nutritious lunch for
   your child. The cafeteria staff has provided us with a KIDZ MENU ($)
   that you may sign up for on the first day of camp (see sign-in table
   for sign-up sheet). Lunches will be delivered by the cafeteria staff to
   the camp. If you meet your child for lunch, you are welcome to eat with
   us. If however you decide to take them elsewhere, you MUST sign them
   out and back in. Please have them back by 12:30 so we can be on time
   for our afternoon activities. Remember the cafeteria becomes very
   crowded at noon. You may want to purchase their lunches ahead of time
   instead of wasting time in line. Remember to check the schedule to see
   if we are eating lunch at LBNL or at an off-site location.

                         Sunscreen, Clothing and Shoes

   Summer is here and so is the sun. If you want your child to wear
   sunscreen, send some with them and write their name on it. We will help
   them apply it.
   Please be sure that your child has the appropriate clothes for that
   day's activities. We are away from the Lab every afternoon and on two
   days of the week we are swimming. It can sometimes get chilly as the
   fog rolls in, so it might be a good idea to have your child keep a
   sweatshirt at camp at all times. We will also be doing a lot of walking
   this summer so it is essential that your child wears good walking
   shoes. I prefer they do not wear sandals as they do not have good
   traction and do not protect their toes.

                               Parent Volunteers

   Parents supervising the lunch hour need to check in with a camp
   counselor. All parents taking their children away from the group at
   lunch must SIGN THEM OUT and SIGN THEM IN when they return. CHILDREN
   MUST BE SUPERVISED AT ALL TIMES. If they need to go to the bathroom,
   they need to go with a buddy. Please be on time as this is the only
   chance for the staff to have a break. Thank you ahead of time for
   volunteering!

                          Donations Are Always Welcome

   We always are looking for sports equipment and games for quiet time.
   Items like books, board games, art supplies, puzzles will be put to
   good use by the children of camp! If you wish these items to be
   returned after camp ends, please label the items and they will be
   returned to you.

                                     Snacks

   A morning and afternoon snack will be provided. The snack may include
   fruit and some type of cracker or other munchie. We ask that children
   carry water bottles or juice boxes with them for an afternoon drink
   since we will be unable to carry one with us. If you think your child
   needs more snacks, then please send something with them. We request NO
   CANDY be sent with your child(ren).

                                    Swimming

   The group will swim two afternoons a week at Strawberry Canyon. These
   days will usually be Monday and Friday. However this may change so
   watch for the weekly agenda.

                           What Children Should Bring

   Please send your child to camp with a BACKPACK, containing the
   following:
     * Sun screen
     * Lip screen
     * Hat with visor
     * Lunch
     * Water bottle
     * Layered clothing, labeled (typical Berkeley weather = am fog and pm
       sun)
     * Sturdy shoes. NO SANDALS
     * Any special medication - must include written permission for the
       counselors to administer. We can not refrigerate medication.
     * Swimsuit and towel (on swim days)
     * Books or other quiet time items. Video games are only allowed at
       quiet time.

                         What Children Should Not Bring

     * Candy
     * Spending money - There will be gift shops at some of the off-site
       locations we visit in the afternoon. Due to supervision
       requirements and in fairness to the other children, we request that
       your child not purchase any items.

                                 Extra Clothing

   Children, being children, may be muddy or wet when you pick them up.
   You may want to keep a change of clothes in your car or at camp for
   these occasions.

                                  Emergencies

   Please be sure that you have filled out all emergency forms. It is
   essential that we have a way to contact you in case of an emergency.
   Your child cannot attend the camp without this information. The
   counselors will have access to a cellular phone (510) 710-7341. The
   number will be available for the duration of camp. Please respect that
   this phone is for emergency use only.

                              Behavior Management

   If any child behaves inappropriately, a staff will first speak with the
   child to resolve the issue. If this does not help, the Assistant
   Director will intervene and speak with the child and the parent. If the
   inappropriate behavior(s) continues, the Director will talk with the
   child and with the parent. As a last resort, the child will be removed
   from the camp.

                                    Illness

   Please do not bring your children if they are ill and not up to the
   activity level described in the schedule. You will be called to pick-up
   your child if they become too ill to participate.

                                Parent Feedback

   SEC directors welcome parent feedback. You can reach all SEC directors
   by sending email to sciencecamp@lbl.gov . Alternatively you may leave
   voice mail at x6566, and an SEC director will return your call. In
   addition, this year we will send home a survey about the camp at the
   end of each week that your child attends camp, and we ask you to return
   the completed survey as soon as possible.

                                   Questions

   If you have any questions, Contact: sciencecamp@lbl.gov or leave voice
   mail at (510) 486-6566.
