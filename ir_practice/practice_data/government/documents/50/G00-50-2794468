                         Shared Neutrals ADR Program

   The Portland Shared Neutrals Program is a cooperative arrangement
   between diverse federal, county, state and other local agencies in the
   Pacific Northwest region. Each member agency makes a reciprocal
   agreement to submit requests for alternative dispute resolution
   services and to share resources cooperatively. It operates under the
   umbrella of the Oregon Federal Executive Board.
