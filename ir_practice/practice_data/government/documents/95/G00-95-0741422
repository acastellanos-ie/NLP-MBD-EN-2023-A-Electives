   [saturn.jpg] Saturn and Titan

   Saturn's largest moon Titan is seen here just after crossing in front
   of the planet in August of 1995. At this time Saturn's rings where
   almost exactly edge-on as seen from the Earth. Several other satellites
   of Saturn are also visible.
   [io.jpg] Io and Jupiter

   Here Io is seen just passing in front of Jupiter, as seen from the
   Galileo spacecraft on the day of its arrival at Jupiter. Galileo has
   since flown by the other three Galilean satellites of Jupiter (Europa,
   Ganymede, and Callisto) during its orbital tour of the Jovian system.

   shown).

   [eclipse.jpg] Lunar Eclipse

   Earth as seen from the Moon on March 24, 1997. At 2:58UT, according to
   Sky & Telescope from March 1997, the Moon entered the umbra.
   [spica.jpg] Stellar Occultation by the Moon

   Spica about to be occulted by the Moon on November 29, 1994.
   Astronomers near central Tokyo observed a beautiful grazing occultation
   just above the north pole of the Moon. (See Sky & Telescope, January
   1997, page 89.) Tokyo's latitude accounts exactly for the difference in
   position seen here.

   features on surface).
