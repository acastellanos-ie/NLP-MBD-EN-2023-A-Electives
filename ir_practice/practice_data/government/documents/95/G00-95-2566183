       On September 19, 2001, a federal grand jury in Cleveland, Ohio,
   returned an indictment, charging Brian D. Wildman with twelve counts of
   Wire Fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343,
    and two counts of Mail Fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States
                             Code, Section 1341.
   The indictment charged that between on or about April 25, 2001, and on

   Division, Brian Wildman, knowingly executed and attempted to execute a
      scheme and artifice to defraud bidders of certain e-Bay Internet
    Auctions, and to obtain money from said individuals by means of false
       and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises, and for
