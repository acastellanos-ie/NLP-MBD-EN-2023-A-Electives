What does OAH do?

   The Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) is an independent state
   agency which conducts impartial administrative hearings for other state
   agencies, including the Employment Security Department (ESD). OAH is
   not part of ESD. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who is a licensed
   attorney, conducts the administrative hearing and makes a written
   decision after the hearing.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

How do I request a hearing?

   Filing an Appeal

   The process leading to an administrative hearing is started by a
   claimant or employer making an appeal. An appeal is a written statement
   that you disagree with a decision by ESD. You can file your appeal by
   letter, or by completing the Notice of Appeal form available at your
   local employment center. You may mail or fax your written appeal to the
   Unemployment Claims Telecenter at the address on ESD's decision.

   There is a deadline for filing an appeal. A claimant or employer must
   respond within 30 days of the date ESD's decision was mailed, or you
   may lose the right to appeal.

   NOTE: If you are a claimant appealing a denial of benefits, you must
   continue to file your weekly claims on your regular schedule. Failure
   to file claims while waiting for the hearing could result in your
   claims being denied for weeks claimed late. If you win your appeal, you
   may only be paid for weeks that you have claimed.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

What happens after an appeal is made?

   Notice of Hearing

   Not less than seven days before the hearing, a Notice of Hearing will
   be mailed to all interested parties. The Notice of Hearing will
   identify the ALJ who will conduct the hearing, the date and time of the
   hearing, and whether you are to appear in person or by telephone for
   the hearing. If the hearing is in person, the Notice of Hearing will
   provide the address where the hearing will take place. The Notice of
   Hearing also identifies what the issues or questions will be at the
   hearing.

   NOTE: If your mailing address changes after you have made an appeal or
   after you have received a Notice of Hearing, contact the OAH office
   identified on the Notice of Hearing with your new mailing address.

   Postponements

   If you are unable to appear for the hearing as scheduled on the Notice
   of Hearing, you must immediately contact the ALJ identified on the
   Notice of Hearing and request a postponement. You must be prepared to
   tell the ALJ the reason why you cannot attend the hearing as scheduled.
   You must contact the ALJ in advance of the hearing, or the ALJ may deny
   your request for a postponement.

   NOTE: If the hearing is scheduled in the next few days and you are
   unable to contact the ALJ to request a postponement, call the OAH
   office identified on the Notice of Hearing and ask to speak with the
   Duty Judge or Senior ALJ about a postponement.

   Withdrawing an Appeal

   The party who makes an appeal can withdraw the appeal before the
   hearing. Contact the OAH office identified on the Notice of Hearing as
   soon as possible once you decide to withdraw the appeal. If the appeal
   is withdrawn, the decision by ESD which was appealed will remain in
   force.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

How do I prepare for my hearing?

   Representation at the Hearing

   A claimant may appear alone and represent her/himself. A family member
   or friend may also represent a claimant. An employer may have a
   manager, supervisor, or corporate officer appear to represent the
   employer. A claimant or an employer may also be represented by an
   attorney. However, the state cannot pay for any parties' representative
   at an administrative hearing.

   Note: If you are a claimant, you may contact the OAH office identified
   on the Notice of Hearing for a list of legal services that may be
   available to represent you at the hearing.

   If someone other than yourself will be representing you at the hearing,
   you or your representative must contact the OAH office identified on
   the Notice of Hearing and provide the representative's name, address,
   and telephone number to OAH. If you do not, your representative may not
   receive a copy of the Notice of Hearing.

   Witnesses

   Both the claimant and the employer have the right to have witnesses
   appear and give testimony at the hearing. Generally, the ALJ will want
   to hear testimony from witnesses who have first-hand knowledge about
   events or circumstances that are relevant to the issues at the hearing.
   A witness has first-hand knowledge when the witness has personally
   observed or participated in the events or circumstances. If possible,
   before asking anyone to appear as a witness be sure to speak to the
   person to determine if the person has any first-hand knowledge. If your
   witness has little first-hand knowledge or will simply repeat what
   other witnesses will say, the ALJ may not allow the witness to testify.

   Do not assume any witness will be at the hearing. Each party is
   responsible for making arrangements for its witnesses to appear at the
   hearing. Be sure to tell your witness the date and time for the
   hearing. If the hearing is by telephone, make sure you know the
   telephone number where your witness can be reached at the time of the
   hearing. If the hearing is in person, give your witness the address
   where the hearing will take place. If you will be appearing in person
   at the hearing, the ALJ may allow your witness to appear by telephone.
   However, you must contact the ALJ identified on the Notice of Hearing
   before the hearing and request the witness be allowed to appear by
   telephone.

   Submission of Documents

   You must provide copies of any documents, records, or other papers you
   want to use at the hearing to the other party or parties and the ALJ
   before the hearing. The names and addresses of the other party or
   parties are listed on the Notice of Hearing. If you fail to provide
   copies of your documents before the hearing the ALJ may decide not to
   consider your documents, or the ALJ may postpone the hearing or
   continue the hearing to another day so all parties have a chance to
   read and review the documents before the hearing.

   Note: If you receive any documents, records, or other papers from OAH
   or the other parties before the hearing, it is important you read the
   documents before the hearing and have the documents with you at the
   time of the hearing. If your hearing is postponed for any reason, be
   sure to keep all the documents you have received and have them with you
   at the next hearing.

   Subpoenas

   If a witness is unwilling to appear at hearing, but you believe his or
   her testimony is necessary, contact the ALJ identified on the Notice of
   Hearing and request a subpoena. If you want a subpoena for a witness,
   you must be prepared to tell the ALJ why you believe the witness is
   necessary, and possibly what you believe the witness will testify
   about. The ALJ will decide whether to grant your request for a
   subpoena. You will also have to provide the witness's name and address.
   Since it takes time to process and serve a subpoena, contact the ALJ as
   soon as possible. The party requesting a subpoena may be responsible
   for serving the subpoena on the witness and for any costs or witness
   fees for the witness.

   If you need documents, records, or other papers to prove your case, but
   they are not available to you, you may request the ALJ to issue a
   subpoena duces tecum. You must be prepared to tell the ALJ why you
   believe the document is necessary to prove your case. The ALJ will
   decide whether to grant your request for a subpoena duces tecum. You
   must be able to identify the documents and who has them. Since it takes
   time to process and serve a subpoena duces tecum, contact the ALJ as
   soon as possible.

   Review of the Hearing File

   The claimant and the employer have the right to review all the
   documents in the file provided to OAH by ESD before the hearing.
   Contact the OAH office identified on your Notice of Hearing to review
   the file.

   Interpreters

   All hearings are conducted in English, and the decision you will
   receive after the hearing will be written in English. While
   unemployment benefit hearings are generally not as formal as a trial in
   a court of law, in order to fully participate in the hearing a person
   must be able to understand and respond to questions in English.
   Sometimes the questions may be complicated. If you or a person who will
   be appearing at the hearing on your behalf speaks limited English or
   speaks English as a second language, OAH will provide an interpreter
   for you at the hearing at no cost to you.

   If you want an interpreter at the hearing and have not requested an
   interpreter before receiving the Notice of Hearing, contact the OAH
   office identified on the Notice of Hearing as soon as possible and
   before the day set for the hearing to request an interpreter. If you do
   not contact OAH before the day set for the hearing, the hearing may
   have to be postponed for an interpreter to be scheduled. You may
   request an interpreter by completing and mailing the form on the
   reverse side of the Notice of Hearing - Instructions and Information
   form. This is the yellow, double sided document mailed with the Notice
   of Hearing.

   NOTE: You cannot bring a family member or friend with you to serve as
   your interpreter at the hearing.

   Special Accommodations

   If you or a person who will be appearing at the hearing on your behalf
   is hearing or speech impaired, contact the OAH office identified on the
   Notice of Hearing to tell OAH what special accommodations are needed.
   You may call OAH using the Washington State Telecommunications Relay
   Service if you have TTY capability. You may reach the Washington State
   Telecommunications Relay Service by calling 1-800-833-6388. OAH can
   provide sign language interpreters and/or relay interpreters at the
   hearing at no cost to you. However, you must contact OAH before the day
   scheduled for the hearing. Otherwise, the hearing may have to be
   postponed until an interpreter can be scheduled.

   There may be people who, due to other unique physical or sensory
   challenges, require other special accommodations to fully participate
   in the hearing. Contact the OAH office identified on the Notice of
   Hearing as soon as possible so arrangements can be made to accommodate
   any special needs.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

What happens during my hearing?

   A hearing is a fact-finding process to determine whether the decision
   by ESD is correct. All testimony is given under oath or affirmation,
   and the hearing is tape recorded. Both the claimant and the employer
   have the right to give testimony, present documents, and question all
   the witnesses at the hearing. The ALJ will also question the witnesses.
   The ALJ will rule on any objections to questions, testimony, or
   documents. The ALJ will determine the order of testimony.

   Telephone Hearings

   In a telephone hearing, participants communicate entirely by means of a
   telephone conference call set up by the ALJ. If you object to a hearing
   being conducted by telephone, you may contact the ALJ identified on the
   Notice of Hearing and request an in-person hearing. The ALJ will decide
   whether to grant your request for an in-person hearing. If you have
   witnesses who will provide testimony at the hearing, the ALJ will add
   the witnesses to the conference call. Be prepared to provide the ALJ
   with the names and telephone numbers where your witnesses can be
   reached.

   What are the Issues at the Hearing

   If a person is discharged, the issue is whether the employee's actions
   are considered to be misconduct. Click here for the definition of
   misconduct in the Revised Code of Washington. The burden of proving
   misconduct is on the employer. If a person quits, the issue is whether
   the person quit for good cause. The burden of proving good cause is on
   the claimant. For further information about doing legal research on
   line, see the Links page.

   Every claimant is also required to prove he/she was able to, available
   for, and actively seeking work during any week when benefits were
   claimed. The ALJ may ask to see a copy of your job search and
   activities log.

   If the case does not involve a discharge or voluntary quit, the ALJ
   will explain the issues at the hearing

   Helpful Tips for the Hearing

   Here are some tips that can help you effectively present your side to
   the ALJ at the hearing:

     * Prior to the hearing think about what you plan to present at the
       hearing. Make a written outline or notes so you don't forget
       something you want the ALJ to consider.
     * Don't interrupt when other people are testifying, unless it is to
       object.
     * Testify only when it is your turn to testify.
     * Don't be belligerent at the hearing.
     * Ask short "to the point" questions.
     * If you have questions during the hearing, ask the ALJ.
     * If you don't know the answer to a question, say that you don't
       know. Don't guess.

   Failure to Appear at the Hearing

   If you are the party who made the appeal but then fail to appear for
   the hearing, your appeal will be dismissed and the decision issued by
   ESD will remain in force.

   If you did not make the appeal but are listed as a party on the Notice
   of Hearing, the hearing will still be held even if you are not present
   to participate. A decision will be made based on the evidence presented
   at the hearing.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

What happens after my hearing?

   The ALJ's Decision

   Usually within two weeks after the hearing you will receive a written
   decision by the Administrative Law Judge who conducted the hearing.

   Petition for Review

   If you disagree with the ALJ's decision, you may file a Petition for
   Review. A Petition for Review should state all the reasons why you
   think the ALJ's decision was wrong. In order to be timely, a Petition
   for Review must be filed within 30 days of the mailing date of the
   ALJ's decision. Failure to file a Petition for Review within the 30-day
   appeal period could mean your case will not be reviewed. The
   instructions for filing a Petition for Review will appear in a
   paragraph just below the ALJ's signature on the ALJ's decision. The
   Petition for Review must be mailed to:

   Employment Security Department
   Agency Records Center
   PO Box 9046
   MS-6000
   Olympia, WA 98507-9046

   All argument in support of the Petition for Review must be submitted
   with the petition and may not exceed five pages. The docket number on
   the ALJ's decision must be included on the Petition for Review. A
   Petition for Review does not need to be filed on an official form.

   NOTE: If you are the claimant and are not working full-time, continue
   to file your weekly claims on your regular schedule. Failure to submit
   claims while waiting for a decision by the ALJ or the Commissioner of
   Employment Security could result in your claims being denied for weeks
   claimed late.

   The Commissioner's Decision

   The Commissioner's Office for ESD reviews the record of the hearing
   conducted by the ALJ and considers the arguments presented in the
   Petition for Review. On rare occasions the case is sent back to the ALJ
   to gather additional evidence and issue a new decision. After
   consideration of the hearing record and the Petition for Review, the
   Commissioner's Office will mail the claimant and the employer another
   written decision.
