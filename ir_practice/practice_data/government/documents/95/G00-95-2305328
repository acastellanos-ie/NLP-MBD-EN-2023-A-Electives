   Between 1969 and 1972 six Apollo missions brought back 382 kilograms
   (842 pounds) of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand and dust from
   the lunar surface. The six space flights returned 2200 separate samples
   from six different exploration sites on the Moon. In addition, three
   automated Soviet spacecraft returned important samples totaling 300
   grams (approximately 3/4 pound) from three other lunar sites. The lunar
   sample building at Johnson Space Center is the chief repository for the
   Apollo samples. The lunar sample laboratory is where pristine lunar
   samples are prepared for shipment to scientists and educators. Nearly
   1000 samples are distributed each year for research and teaching
   projects.

   Study of rock and soil samples from the Moon continues to yield useful
   information about the early history of the Moon, the Earth, and the
   inner solar system. Recent computer models indicate that the Moon could
   have been formed from the debris resulting from the Earth being struck
   a glancing blow by a planetary body about the size of Mars. The
   chemical composition of the Moon, derived from studies of lunar rocks,
   is compatible with this theory of the origin of the Moon. We have
   learned that a crust formed on the Moon 4.4 billion years ago. This
   crust formation, the intense meteorite bombardment occurring afterward,
   and subsequent lava outpourings are recorded in the rocks. Radiation
   spewed out by the Sun since the formation of the Moon's crust, was
   trapped in the lunar soil as a permanent record of solar activity
   throughout this time.
