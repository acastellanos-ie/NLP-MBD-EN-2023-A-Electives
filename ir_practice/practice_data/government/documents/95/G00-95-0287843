                                   Concept

   Fitness Activism is good business. Contributing to the cause of fitness
   in our own communities, states, and country is not only a strategic
   investment in our market, it is a tactical marketing opportunity in
   itself.

   Fitness clubs, club industry vendors, and all fitness professionals
   share a vested interest in promoting the cause of fitness. The fitness
   industry has the added incentive to contribute to a cause that
   increases demand. Corporate America has set the precedence by proving
   the marketing potential of community service and charitable causes.

   Fitness people are among the most dedicated and well intended group of
   professionals - professionals who will welcome an opportunity to
   contribute. We believe in what we do for a living and in the good we
   bring to our market. We are, by nature, Fitness Activists. We are
   marketing the industry every day with an enthusiastic fervor. Think of
   what Jack LaLanne has done for our industry. Keep in mind how Nike has
   promoted their products by focusing on popularizing fitness.

   This combination of forces has barely been explored, but all the pieces
   are there. The programs and people are out there waiting to be better
   organized.

   A system will be brought together by the private sector driven by the
   natural law of economic viability. It is the industry suppliers that
   have the greatest opportunity here! They can, by developing programs
   for the clubs, take the lead and benefit the most.

   The article entitled Fitness Activism, illustrates the opportunity at
   hand.

                                  Programs

   California has the best infrastructure for getting the Fitness Activist
   ball rolling across the country.

   The California Governors Council is the most aggressive council in the
   country. Chair Arnold Schwarzenegger is at the head of its long list of
   high visibility celebrities which includes the Godfather of Fitness
   himself, Jack LaLanne. The Council coalition is made up of over 50
   organizations. Over seven local councils have already been created in
   its 2 year history providing extended reach into the communities of
   California.

   The Council has an array of model programs that can be used to develop
   new club and supplier marketing systems. Some of the programs with the
   best potential include:

   Operation Fit Kids
   This organization makes fitness equipment, curriculum, and after-school
   programs accessible to the kids. Clubs can donate older equipment,
   provide operational support, and make a difference to kids who,
   otherwise, may never receive the benefits of quality fitness equipment
   and programming.

   Fit for Kids
   This points-incentive-based program gives children, living in high risk
   areas, sports and fitness activities as alternatives to gangs, guns,
   and drugs. Clubs who wish to participate in the "Have a Heart for Kids"
   fund raiser are offering donors a free workout.

   Inner-City Games
   The goals of the games are to encourage the spirit of competitive play
   and to provide youths with avenues for participation in positive
   alternatives to gangs, drugs, and crime. This is a year-around program
   providing operational and sponsorship opportunities for clubs.

   Other programs include Junior Triathlon, Presidents Sports Awards
   Program, Fitness is Fun, EYECYCLE, PASS, and Cities in Schools.

                                 Methodology

   Each program offers different marketing opportunities that fit the
   needs of various clubs and vendors.

   All the pieces are there. The job at hand is for fitness industry
   vendors to package, test, refine, and market the system.

   The opportunity for clubs is to become test sites which will take the
   programs to the front lines, put the system to work via public
   relations and marketing efforts, operationally run the programs, and
   provide feedback.

                                   Systems

  Membership Drive Program

   Clubs put on membership drives for the community service programs and
   donate the price of a trial memberships or a workout. The drive brings
   prospects in for the cause. The club, community service program,
   membership drive, and the program sponsor receive the public relations
   exposure.

  Model Program "Cookbooks"

   There are a number of model programs ready for cookbooks which will
   help others run the programs. Sponsorship would provide recognition on
   the cookbook, operational material, and, in some cases, on the program
   promotional material.

  Equipment Packages

   This program puts a powerful sales tool into the hands of your reps.
   When a club is ready to upgrade their equipment, you can offer them a
   discount or value added on an equipment package deal. In return, they
   will agree to donate their old equipment which is then placed in an
   appropriate facility. Cooperative public relations provides additional
   incentive. Ongoing operational support by the club at the site
   receiving the equipment gives the club continued public service
   exposure.

  Professional Fitness Activist Network

   This is a program that helps place fitness professionals into community
   service, fitness related programs. The sponsor is recognized in every
   contact with the fitness professionals, including trade show seminars,
   phone greetings, internet web page, hand out material, etc.
