Fraud and Abuse

Overview

   Welcome to the Fraud and Abuse section of our website. The purpose of
   this section is to:
     * Describe common Medicare Fraud
     * Teach visitors how to report suspected fraud in the Medicare system
     * Present ongoing fraud campaigns

   Medicare is taking strong action to combat fraud and abuse in key
   areas. Our goal is to make sure Medicare only does business with
   legitimate providers and suppliers who will provide Medicare
   beneficiaries with high quality services.

   The effort to prevent and detect fraud, abuse, and waste is a
   cooperative one that involves:
     * The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
     * Medicare beneficiaries
     * Medicare contractors and providers
     * State and Federal Agencies such as, the Office of the Inspector
       General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the
       Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of
       Justice.

   Since February 1998, Medicare beneficiaries across the country have
   received a toll-free number on their Medicare statements, making it
   easier for them to help Medicare crack down on fraud and abuse. This
   hotline is staffed Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
   Eastern Standard Time, and assistance is available in both English and
   Spanish.
