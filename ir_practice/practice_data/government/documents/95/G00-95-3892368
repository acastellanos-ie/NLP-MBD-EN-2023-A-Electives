   The John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) in South Mississippi is one of
   ten NASA field centers in the United States. It is NASA's primary
   center for testing and flight certifying rocket propulsion systems for
   the Space Shuttle and future generations of space vehicles. Because of
   its important role in engine testing for four decades, Stennis Space
   Center has been designated NASA's Center of Excellence for rocket
   propulsion testing. Stennis is also NASA's lead center for rocket
   propulsion testing with total responsibility for conducting and/or
   managing all NASA propulsion test programs.

   Stennis Space Center tests all Space Shuttle Main Engines. These
   high-performance, liquid-fueled engines provide most of the total
   impulse needed during the shuttle's eight and one-half-minute-flight to
   orbit. All shuttle main engines must pass a series of test firings
   (below right) at Stennis Space Center prior to being installed in the
   back of the orbiter (below left).

   The Earth Science Applications Directorate is NASA's Lead Center for
   Earth Science Applications. The Directorate matches NASA's scientific
   and technical knowledge with issues of national concern and the needs
   of our partners. Partners include local, state, and tribal governments,
   commercial industry, with educational institutions and other non-profit
   institutions. Through the Directorate's co-funded partnerships, public
   and private sector decision makers learn how to apply new technologies
   to critical environmental, resource management, community growth, and
   disaster management issues. The Directorate also provides the remote
   sensing community with a comprehensive array of manmade and natural
   ground targets, measurement systems, and benchmark processes to help
   test airborne and space remote sensing systems against performance
   specifications and customer needs.

   Stennis Space Center began "re-inventing government" decades ago before
   the concept became popular. Over the years, SSC has evolved into a
   multiagency, multidisciplinary center for federal, state, academic and
   private organizations engaged in space, oceans, environmental programs
   and the national defense. In addition to NASA, there are 30 other
   agencies located at Stennis. Of approximately 4,400 employees, about
   l,600 work in the fields of science and engineering.

   These agencies work side by side and share common costs related to
   infrastructure, facility and technical services, thus making it cheaper
   for each to accomplish its independent mission at SSC.
