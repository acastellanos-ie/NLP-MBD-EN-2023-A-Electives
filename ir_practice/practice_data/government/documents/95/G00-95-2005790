                                Introduction

   Scientific Frontiers and Information Technology is a component of the
   Information Technology Research program. Official information about
   that program is provided in the Program Solicitation, document NSF
   01-149. Information on this page is advisory only; NSF provides it to
   give potential PIs additional context for the program and informal
   guidance for their submissions.

   This focus area will support research and education activities at the
   interfaces of information technology and science and engineering.
   Projects may be either theoretical or empirical. Among the kinds of
   projects encouraged are those that seek to:
     * Create new instruments with new capabilities;
     * Use computation to explore new science and/or engineering concepts;
     * Develop new paradigms for computing (e.g., DNA or quantum
       computing).

   Examples of such projects are:
     * Acquiring spatial data and using it in large-scale predictive
       models;
     * Computational methods for looking at stochastic and nonlinear
       dynamical factors in complex systems;
     * Stochastic models of human interactions;
     * Computational predictions of rare, catastrophic, or revolutionary
       events;
     * Analysis, modeling and optimizing of multi-scale phenomena;
     * Knowledge discovery, visualization and interpretation of
       large-scale heterogeneous data sets;
     * Integrating data from multiple sources and creating consistent data
       sets over vast scales in space and time;
     * New algorithms for geometrical objects;
     * Hybrid discrete and continuous models of system designed to control
       physical systems;
     * Tools for high-confidence software and systems;
     * Construction of databases, and innovative database structures using
       districted and very dense storage systems, and novel methods for
       information retrieval; and
     * Innovative uses of the Internet in science and engineering.

   Some of the representative problems and subjects in science and
   engineering appropriate for this focus area are:
     * Computational biology, including modeling and simulation at all
       scales from molecular to environmental. Examples are relating
       genomic and proteomic information to the development and function
       of organisms.
     * Biological system informatics, such as the analysis, annotation and
       curation of genomic, organismal, or ecosystem information, and
       including data mining and data modeling in biological contexts and
       integrating primary databases. Relevant examples include techniques
       for parsing genomes; predicting structure from sequence in RNA and
       proteins; building and verifying complex biological networks;
       algorithms for designing, managing, and linking databases;
       development of new tools for analysis at all levels of biology; and
       development of innovative data structures for handling biodiversity
       data at many scales of time and space, as well as the millions of
       different species that are part of the Tree of Life.
     * Comprehensive models that may include ensemble forecasting, nesting
       and/or data assimilation techniques to understand the complex
       interactions taking place in the Earth system and provide better
       predictive capability of phenomena ranging from natural hazards to
       biogeochemical cycles, space weather and climate change; methods
       and co laboratories for the integration of heterogeneous
       environmental data sets from multiple observatories into models.
     * The physics of the universe, the interfaces of the mathematical and
       physical sciences with the biological and environmental sciences,
       quantum information sciences, computational materials research,
       science at the nanoscale, and novel computational methods, e.g.,
       computational data grids for the collection and distributed
       analysis of massive data sets.
     * High-end computing tools to accelerate the design of next
       generation IT manufacturing techniques in areas such as photonic
       crystals, optical and electronic switching devices, sensors, and
       detectors; simulation-based modeling and computing of multi-scale
       materials properties and microstructure-based materials design; and
       productivity tools for design, planning and control of spatially
       and ownership-distributed virtual manufacturing, supply chain and
       distribution systems.
     * Activities in which psychology and language sciences collaborate
       closely with computer and information sciences to achieve advances
       in language-information technology, such as documentation and
       comparison of linguistic diversity to reveal the cognitive
       architecture that supports human language, and sophisticated study
       of variation in how individuals learn and use language.
