   Publications icon
   In order to protect public and private property from being destroyed by
   lava flows, various plans and actual attempts have been made in the
   past on volcanoes to stop or divert lava flows. The most extensive ever
   attempted, however, were the lava-cooling operations on Heimaey,
   Iceland, and the two excellent accounts of the operations that were
   published in Icelandic by a geophysicist, Thorbjörn Sigurgeirsson, and
   two engineers, Valdimar Kr. Jónsson and Matthías Matthíasson, are
   translated into English in this open-file report.
