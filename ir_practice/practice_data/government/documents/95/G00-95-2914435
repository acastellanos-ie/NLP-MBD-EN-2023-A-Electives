                                 OTA ARCHIVE

     The congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) closed its
     doors September 29, 1995. For 23 years, the nonpartisan analytical
     agency assisted Congress with the complex and highly technical
     issues that increasingly affect our society.

     The 104th Congress voted to withdraw funding for OTA and its
     full-time staff of 143 persons, and cover only a skeleton staff and
     the amount needed for the agency's final closeout.

     For copies of OTA publications, contact Superintendent of Documents,
     P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7974, [phone (202) 512-1800;
     FAX (202) 512-2250].

     Publications are also available in paper or microfiche from the
     National Technical Information Service (NTIS). To confirm prices and
     to order, call (703) 487-4650; for rush orders call (1-800)
     553-NTIS.

     An archival OTA CD-ROM set (S/N 052-003-01457-2) is available for
     $23.00 through the Superintendent of Documents, P.O. Box 371954,
     Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7974, [phone (202) 512-1800; FAX (202)
     512-2250]. The OTA CD-ROM set includes all reports produced by the
     agency over its history, packaged along with much of the information
     formerly available via its world wide web site, OTA Online, as well
     as some additional historical material. It is a fully indexed
     collection, accessible via a Web browser such as Mosaic or Netscape
     and includes all OTA reports in portable document format [PDF]
     readable via Adobe's Acrobat reader software that is also packaged
     with the collection.

     OTA reports and background papers will be available for study at the
     University of Maryland (College Park), George Mason University in
     Fairfax, Va., and the University of California-Santa Barbara.

     OTA Online is currently mirrored by the following web site:

   The Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at
   Princeton University

   In addition, xOTA, the Office of Technology Assessment Alumni Network,
   has been formed to assure a continuation of the institutional memory of
   OTA's process and culture as embodied in its staff. Its purpose is to
   establish and maintain a personal and professional network of former
   OTA employees and to engage in activities that advance the interest of
   xOTA members. The first product was a directory available to all former
   employees. Future activities include the establishment of online
   services for members through a Worldwide Web site, an annual update of
   the directory, and a newsletter.
