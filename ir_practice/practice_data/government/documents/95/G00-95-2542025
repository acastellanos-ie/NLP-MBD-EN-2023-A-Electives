Frequently Asked Questions

For Consumers:

    1. What is the difference between an optometrist, ophthalmologist, and
       an optician?
       Doctors of optometry (i.e., OD's) are independent primary health
       care providers who examine, diagnose, treat (if TPA certified) and
       manage diseases and disorders of the visual system, the eye and
       associated structures. Optometrists are highly educated and trained
       to diagnose disease and pathological conditions manifested in the
       human eye, such glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. An
       ophthalmologist is a physician who specializes in diagnosing and
       treating eye diseases. They also perform eye surgery and may
       prescribe corrective lenses. An optician fills prescription orders
       written by optometrists and ophthalmologists.
    2. Can I have my prescription for eyeglasses?
       Yes. According to a Federal Trade Commission ruling optometrists
       are required to give each patient a copy of his or her prescription
       immediately following an eye exam.
    3. Can I have my prescription for contact lenses?
       Optometrists are not required to release a copy of a contact lens
       prescription. Release of a prescription for contact lenses is up to
       the sole discretion of the optometrist. Ask your optometrist what
       his or her policy is with regard to the release of a contact lens
       prescription prior to having an eye exam.

For Optometrists:

    1. Can I use my 80 hour didactic TPA course for CE credit?
       Yes, you may use the 80 hours for up to two years from the
       completion date of the course.
    2. Can I use any of my 65 hour preceptorship for CE credit?
       No.
    3. When do I need to renew my CPR certification?
       Your CPR certification needs to be current at the time your license
       to practice optometry in California is renewed. Please reference
       California Code of Regulations section 1536 sub-section (j) which
       is on page 170 of the "2001 Law Book" provided on this website.
    4. How to get a DEA number?
       With the enactment of new TPA legislation (See "New TPA Law" on
       this website), TPA doctors may now obtain a DEA registration
       number. The registration application form may be obtained by
       contacting the DEA at 1-800-882-9539.
       When completing the registration form remember that California OD's
       are mid-level practitioners and only have access to Schedule III
       Narcotic drugs. The only Schedule III Narcotic drugs available to
       California OD's are codeine with compounds and hydrocodone with
       compounds. Note that prescribing these drugs can only be for ocular
       related pain for a maximum of three days. If the pain persists
       after three days, the patient must be referred to an
       ophthalmologist.
       Further, there is no state controlled substance number and with the
       above specified Schedule III Narcotics, California OD's can
       prescribe, administer, dispense and procure these drugs.
    5. What do I tell pharmacists who refuse to fill my prescriptions
       without a DEA number?
       A letter was sent by the Board of Pharmacy to all registered
       California pharmacists regarding TPA certified optometrists. This
       letter related the fact that TPA certified optometrists can
       prescribe certain drugs.
    6. What information is required on prescriptions I write?
       Any prescription or order by an optometrist comprising written
       specifications for ophthalmic lenses pursuant to an eye examination
       must contain the following minimal information: Name, address,
       telephone number and license number of the issuing optometrist;
       his/her signature; issue and expiration date; and patient's name.
       (For further details please refer to B&P 1565)
    7. How can I advertise my TPA status?
       TPA optometrists may advertise that he or she is certified by the
       Board of Optometry to prescribe therapeutic pharmaceutical agents.
    8. Am I required to release a contact lens prescription?
       No. However, you must provide a copy of their spectacle
       prescription immediately after the eye examination is completed. In
       addition, pursuant to the California Code of Regulations 1566, you
       must post in a conspicuous place a notice which clearly states the
       legal requirements and office policy regarding release of
       eyeglasses and contact lens prescriptions. Such notice must at a
       minimum contain the following information:
       Notice to Consumers Regarding Release of Prescription
       Federal law requires that a written copy of the spectacle
       prescription be given to the patient. However, the law does not
       require the release of a contact lens prescription; this is left to
       the discretion of the optometrist. You may want to inquire about
       your doctor's policy regarding contact lens prescription prior to
       the examination.
