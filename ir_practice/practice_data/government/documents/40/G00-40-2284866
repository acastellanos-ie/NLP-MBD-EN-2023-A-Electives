   The Northern District of Ohio Advisory Group (the Advisory Group) had
   its origin in the early 1990s as part of the Judicial Conference of the
   United States effort to implement the Civil Justice Reform Act (CJRA).
   A CJRA advisory group was established in this district, and many others
   throughout the country, to facilitate modernization and improvement of
   the federal court system. The CJRA advisory group developed,
   recommended and helped popularize the Differentiated Case Management
   Plan (DCM ) and various Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) options
   which the Court has used since 1992, and provided information to the
   Court on issues ranging from proposed changes to federal and local
   rules, magistrate utilization, litigation costs and continuing legal
   education.

   The success of the CJRA advisory group caused the Judicial Conference
   of the United States to recommend that the various district courts
   continue to use their advisory groups as a way to maintain open dialog
   on case management and other matters of interest to the bench and bar.
   Consequently, the Court formed the Northern District of Ohio Advisory
   Group (the Advisory Group) in 1999 with the mission of providing
   information on matters of interest to the Court and to assist in the
   implementation of Court adopted programs such as electronic filing and
   the electronic courtroom projects. The Advisory Group is also charged
   with bringing to the attention of the Court matters of interest to the
   bar and the community.

   While the Advisory Group has been appointed by the Court, the views of
   the Group and its individual members are their own and do not
   necessarily represent the opinions of either the Court or its
   individual judges.

   Members of the Advisory Group consist of the following:
     * The U.S. Attorney (or her representative)
     * The Federal Defender (or his representative)
     * 3 individuals appointed by the chief judge (including one
       designated as chair)
     * 2 individuals appointed by each district judge (both active and
       senior)
     * 1 individual appointed by each magistrate judge
     * 1 representative of the Federal Bar Association
     * 1 representative from each law school in the district (CWRU, CSU,
       Akron, Toledo, Ohio Northern)

   Meetings of the Advisory Group are held twice each year, but various
   committees meet throughout the year. The committees consider matters
   specific to the subject of the committee and present proposed
   recommendations to the entire Advisory Group at one of the semiannual
   meetings. Upon majority approval, formal recommendations are adopted
   Advisory Group image and presented to the Court for consideration.

   In order to further its mission and serve as a link to the Court, the
   Advisory Group welcomes suggestions regarding matters to be considered
   by the Advisory Group and presented to the Court. Suggestions can be
   submitted to the Advisory Group by sending an e-mail to one of the
   committee chairs.
