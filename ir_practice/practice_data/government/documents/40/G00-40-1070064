   SDP Description

   DHHS Software Distribution Project   November 28, 2001

   Introduction

   The Center for Information Technology initiated the Software
   Distribution Project to acquire and deliver brand-name software to NIH
   and DHHS personnel. The SDP takes advantage of large volume purchasing
   agreements to provide significantly discounted software to its
   customers. The SDP also saves its participants time and money by
   eliminating the need to search for the best software deals.

   The SDP provides major software titles to more than 40,000 customers,
   including more than half of DHHS personnel, and all of NIH. Nearly ten
   million dollars are saved annually through this program.

   Enrollment Requirements

   The enrollment fees for the SDP depend on several factors: manufacturer
   agreement, software requirements, and agency commitments. The
   enrollment fee is dependent upon the level of participation and
   determines which software and support is available (see list below).
   Please contact your IC/Agency Contact for specific product and pricing
   information.

   Fees are due at the time of enrollment/renewal. The fees are paid
   through the CIT account identified by the IC/Agency.

   CIT Commitments

   CIT provides software licenses, maintenance and support for workstation

   of performance, following which the IC/Agency is granted irrevocable
   license to use the software in perpetuity. The software maintenance
   allows the participating IC/Agency to install the most recent version
   of the software throughout the period of performance. The software
   support includes Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) support
   mechanisms that are augmented by CIT-provided support.

   IC/Agency Roles and Responsibilities

   program administration within the IC/Agency. The contacts primary role
   is to assign roles to IC/Agency staff for accessing and installing the
