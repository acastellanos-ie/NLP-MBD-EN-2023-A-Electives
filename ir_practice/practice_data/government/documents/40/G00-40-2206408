   General Information:

   FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute

   FAA's Office of Aviation Medicine


                        Aeromedical Research Program

   The Aeromedical research program addresses improved health, safety, and
   survivability of aircraft passengers and aircrews.  There are two major
   program areas: (1) Toxicology and Accident Research which evaluates
   medical findings gleaned from aircraft accidents to improve the safe
   operation of aircraft; and (2) Protection and Survival which develops
   injury reducing materials and structures, and also evaluates survival
   equipment and procedures to protect aircraft occupants.  Program
   outcomes include:
     * Human failure modes (physiological, psychological, clinical) both
       in uneventful flight and during civil aircraft incidents and
       accidents are identified and formal recommendations for
       counteracting measures are provided.
     * The FAA is able to develop bioaeronautical guidelines, standards
       and models for aircraft cabin equipment, procedures, and
       environments as a base for regulatory action to enhance appropriate
       human performance.
     * Pilot medical and flight histories and information from accidents
       and incidents are reviewed to develop new medical criteria,
       standards, and assessment/certification procedures to ensure full
       performance capability.
     * Assessments of flight attendant and passenger work, behavior, and
       disease issues are used to propose guidelines for actions to
       improve the health and safety  of cabin occupants.
