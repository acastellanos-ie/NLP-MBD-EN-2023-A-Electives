   Cosmic rays are sub-atomic particles which are accelerated to
   incredible speeds and high energies somewhere out in space. Explosions
   on the surface of the sun are one source of cosmic rays, but other
   energetic events, like supernova explosions, can also generate cosmic
   rays. By detecting cosmic rays scientists are able to probe directly
   the conditions of matter out in space. Since these sub-atomic particles
   are electrically charged, they tend to follow magnetic field lines; so
   one of the best places to trap cosmic rays is at the earth's poles,
   where the magnetic field bends down towards the earth's surface. The
   picture above shows the launch preparation of a balloon experiment to
   detect cosmic rays above Antarctica. The instrument is called the Trans
   Iron Galactic Element Recorder, or TIGER, and it was launched from
   McMurdo Station in December 2001 and flown around the south pole for a
   flight of nearly 32 days. By collecting cosmic ray particles above the
   south pole, TIGER will help determine the source of material injected
   into the cosmic ray accelerators, and to determine how the material is
   injected into the accelerator.
