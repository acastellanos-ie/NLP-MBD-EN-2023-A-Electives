                              The Helix Systems
     __________________________________________________________________

   As the centralized resource for high performance scientific computing
   in the Center for Information Technology, the Helix Systems currently
   comprise five computer systems: Helix, Nimbus, Galaxy, Quasar and
   Biowulf. The features and capabilities of each of these systems are
   described in further detail below. Multiple systems allow different
   high performance computer architectures to be matched to the
   applications and programming styles for which they are best suited. A
   multiple system model also makes it easy to provide new systems with
   the latest and most cost effective technology much sooner than it would
   otherwise. The five systems are integrated in many respects so that a
   user on one system may be actually using the computational resources on
   another; most user disk space is common to all machines. All of the
   Helix systems offer a full development environment for users writing
   their own code in C, C++, and Fortran. By obtaining a Helix Systems
   account, users have access to each of the computing systems: [Hardware
   Summary]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Helix (helix.nih.gov).
          Helix is the "hostname" of the primary login machine of the
          Helix Systems. Its main role is to provide a full suite of third
          party scientific applications as well as mail hosting for some
          of the other systems. Helix, an SGI Origin 2400, is a shared
          memory SMP (symmetrical multiprocessor) computer, meaning that
          each of its processors has direct access to all of system
          memory. This architecture is well-suited to third-party
          "turnkey" applications, and is used by application programmers
          who wish to design code using the traditional shared memory
          model.

   Nimbus (nimbus.nih.gov).
          Nimbus, another SGI shared memory multiprocessor, is used for
          applications requiring large computational or memory resources.

   Galaxy & Quasar (galaxy.nih.gov & quasar.nih.gov).
          Galaxy and Quasar are 32 and 16 processor SGI Origin 2000s
          respectively. They use a ccNUMA architecture (cache coherent,
          non-uniform memory access) to combine the scalability of
          distributed memory machines with the ease of use of traditional
          shared memory SMP computers. The automatic parallelizing
          compilers will help you take maximum advantage of these highly
          parallel machines.

   Beowulf Cluster (biowulf.nih.gov).
          This 360 processor parallel computer, named Biowulf, represents
          the latest trend in high performance computing: a distributed
          memory system composed entirely of commodity components such as
          Pentium processors and fast-ethernet interconnects.
          "Supercomputing performance at a fraction of the cost." To
          enable access to Biowulf, users must complete the online form
          and provide a short description of their project (click here).

   Shared File Server.
          In addition to the above five systems, the Helix staff maintains
          a Network Appliance F760 Filer. The filer provides Helix Systems
          users with access to high performance NFS RAID file systems over
          a dedicated high speed network. 600 GB of online storage is
          available in a high availability configuration that includes
          redundant components and clustered failover. Researchers can
          seamlessly move between computational platforms without having
          to transfer their data or maintain multiple copies.
