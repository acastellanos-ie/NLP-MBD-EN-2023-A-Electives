   Project Description: The recent completion of the smart card protection
   profile by the industry-led Smart Card Security Users Group (SCSUG) and
   the successful evaluation and validation of the profile by independent
   testing facilities in four nations participating in the Common Criteria
   Recognition Arrangement were significant events in the international
   Common Criteria Project. This project demonstrated the benefits of a
   government-industry partnership in developing meaningful sets of
   security requirements for key technologies essential for the protection
   of IT systems and networks. Having participated in the first phase of
   this project, there have been many requests from the industry
   participants on the SCSUG as well as the international partners in the
   Common Criteria Project to move ahead into the second phase of the
   project--that is, developing specific test methods and laboratory
   accreditation criteria for organizations wishing to conduct smart card
   evaluations.

   The Common Criteria assurance requirements and associated Common
   Evaluation Methodology provides a level of granularity that does not
   always lend itself to consistent and repeatable testing across testing
   laboratories both nationally and internationally. It is also apparent
   the traditional testing conducted by the SCSUG members does not always
   align with the Common Criteria or the Common Evaluation Methodology.
   Specialized technologies sometimes call for more detailed and
   specialized testing procedures. In addition, testing laboratories may
   require specialized equipment, physical plant modifications and
   personnel with specialized technical skills uniquely associated with
   smart card evaluations.

   Project Objectives: Taking a stable, evaluated protection profile in a
   key technology area (e.g., smart card protection profile), work with
   government and industry partners to develop: (1) refinements and
   possible extensions to the assurance requirements in the selected
   protection profile and the associated Common Evaluation Methodology
   (termed test methods), and (2) laboratory accreditation criteria to
   include proficiency testing for laboratory personnel to demonstrate
   competence in the new test methods. The benefits of technology-based
   accreditation are six-fold:
     * Greater specificity in IT security testing and evaluation processes
       traceable to Common Criteria requirements in protection profiles;
     * More objective, consistent, and repeatable IT security testing and
       evaluation;
     * More cost-effective and timely security evaluation results for
       consumers and producers of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
       products;
     * Demonstrated competency in specialized technology testing through
       proficiency testing;
     * Reduced need for interpretations of functional and assurance
       requirements and for intensive technical oversight by
       certification/validation authority; and
     * Potential for exportability of technology-based test methods for
       use by Common Criteria partners and participating certification
       bodies leading to greater comparability of evaluations
       internationally.
