        Who is eligible to receive healthcare through the VA system?
   Any individual who served on active duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force,
     Marines or Coast Guard, and received honorable discharge or release
     under honorable conditions has basic eligibility for VA healthcare.
    Those who served after 1980 must have served 24 months active duty to
                                be eligible.

                               How do I apply?
   A quick and easy application form is available at any VA facility or by
    calling for an appointment. Applications are also available over the
                Internet by accessing the following web site:
                        http://www.va.gov/1010ez.htm.

                        What services can I receive?
    All necessary inpatient and outpatient services including preventive
       and primary care, diagnostic and treatment services as well as
     rehabilitation, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment,
    home health, respite and hospice care, women's clinic and prescribed
                                   drugs.

                         What does VA care cost me?
   While no monthly premium is required to use VA care, co-payments may be
    required depending on your eligibility and income level. (If you have
   insurance, it may cover the cost of the co-payments). Veterans who are
     Service Connected (SC), who require care for the SC condition, will
      receive healthcare at no cost for treatment required for that SC
        condition. For more information, visit our Enrollment Guide's
                        Co-Payment Information page.

                                     Top

     Are there restrictions on getting care in private facilities at VA
                                  expense?
    Yes. Care in private facilities at VA expense is provided only under
     certain circumstances, namely, when VA has a contract agreement for
   certain services or when a service disabled veterans lives too far from
   a VA facility to receive care and has obtained VA approval in advance.

                       What about emergency services?
   VA provides urgent and emergency care in VA facilities. VA's ability to
        pay for emergency care in non-VA facilities is very limited.

                                     Top

                     What if I get sick while traveling?
       You may receive health care at any VA facility in the country.
   Familiarize yourself with where VA healthcare facilities are located in
   the area where you will be traveling. Reimbursement for care in non-VA
    facilities is very limited. (For a list of VA facilities nationwide,
                    visit the VA's Facilities Directory).

                 Will VA take care of my nursing home needs?
   VA's Community Nursing Home Care Program is designed to assist veterans
   and their families in making the transition from hospital to community.
   VA community contract nursing home care services are available for >0%
   SC to < 70% SC who need nursing home care for the specific SC condition
       for as long as nursing home care is needed for the specific SC
     condition. Veterans who are >= 70% SC are eligible for nursing home
     care for any condition for as long as nursing home care is needed.

                    Can I get free prescriptions from VA?
    Medications are provided to veterans who are enrolled with the VA and
   receive healthcare provided by a VA primary care provider. Medications
       are prescribed for treatment of a condition for which they are
       receiving healthcare from the VA provider. Depending on service
    connected status, there may be a co-payment required for medications.
    For more information, visit our Enrollment Guide's Prescription Drugs
                              Information page.

                           Can I get dental care?
     Generally, dental benefits are limited to service connected dental
   conditions or to veterans who are permanently and totally disabled from
                          service connected causes.

                                     Top

                Does VA provide hearing aids and eyeglasses?
     Yes, if you are service disabled with a disability rating of 10% or
    more. Otherwise, hearing aids and eyeglasses will only be provided in
   special circumstances and not for generally occurring hearing or vision
                                    loss.

                                     Top

                     Does VA provide maternity services?
    VA does provide maternity care, but cannot provide care to a newborn
   child, even immediately after birth. The veteran mother must make other
                     arrangements for care of the child.

                                     Top

    There hasn't been much said lately about VA benefits for the children
              with spina bifida. Where does that program stand?
     Since Dec. 1, VA has offered health-care insurance and an allowance
    ranging from $221 to $1,317 a month to some people with spina bifida.
   They must be the children of veterans who served in Vietnam during the
      Vietnam War. Congress authorized the benefits because of evidence
      linking the illness to a parent's exposure to the herbicide Agent
   Orange. VA recently created a toll-free number where people can receive
          information about the spina bifida program. The number is
                               1-888-820-1756.

   I've heard that VA will now pay for treatment in the emergency rooms of
           private hospitals. How do I get VA to pick up the bill?
    The new coverage for non-VA emergency care has a narrow scope. It is
    designed as a safety net for veterans who do not have any way to pay
    for emergency health care services. If you are treated at a civilian
      facility for a non-emergency, you will not be covered under this
   benefit. To be eligible for this coverage, veterans must have no other
    form of health coverage, including Medicare or Medicaid. They must be
    enrolled in VA's health care system and have been seen by a VA health
   care professional with 24 months. The civilian facility typically files
      the paperwork to be reimbursed by VA. For information about VA's
     emergency care benefits, contact the nearest VA medical facility or
                            call 1-877-222-8387.

      I was a POW during World War II. How do I get the new POW medal?
   The military issues medals, not the VA. If you were in the Navy, Marine
     Corps or Coast Guard, write to: U.S. Navy Liaison Office, National
    Personnel Records Center, Room 3475, 9700 Paige Blvd., St. Louis, MO
   63132. If you were in the Army, write to Army Reserve Personnel Center,
    Attn: ARPC-VSE, National Personnel Records Center, 9700 Paige Blvd.,
    St. Louis, MO, 63132. If you were in the Air Force, write to National
      Personnel Records Center (Military Personnel Records), 9700 Paige
                         Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63132.

   If possible, include a copy of your discharge papers, dates of service,
        service number or Social Security number and other pertinent
   information. Survivors can receive the POW Medal on behalf of veterans
                        who died before receiving it.

   My father was buried in a private cemetery. Is he still eligible for a
                     VA headstone? Is there any charge?
       To be eligible for a VA headstone or marker, a veteran must be
        discharged from active duty under what's technically known as
   "conditions other than dishonorable." VA will provide a flat marker or
    an upright headstone, regardless of the cemetery. It is inscribed and
    shipped at government expense. For burials in private cemeteries, the
     survivors must pay the cost of placing the headstone or marker. For
   more information, visit the National Cemetery Administration web site.

   I'm a Vietnam veteran. How can I know if I was exposed to Agent Orange?
       For the purpose of establishing a legal right to VA disability
    compensation and VA health care, VA assumes that everyone in Vietnam
   was exposed to Agent Orange. A veteran had to have served in Vietnam -
    not elsewhere in Southeast Asia - from January 9, 1962 through May 7,
     1975. This includes people who served off shore and in assignments
    elsewhere that involved visiting Vietnam. For more information, visit
                        the VA Agent Orange Web Page.

   I saw a news program on television that says veterans graves are going
          unmarked. When did VA stop giving headstones to veterans?
   Since the Civil War, the federal government has provided headstones or
     markers for the graves of veterans. There has always been a catch,
   which news organizations recently focused upon. VA gives the headstones
    or markers only if the veteran's grave doesn't already have a marker.
   In this case, a marker is defined as something with the veteran's full
   name, date of birth and date of death. If a veteran's grave already has
       a marker, federal law says, in effect, that VA cannot provide a
      headstone or marker. Some lawmakers and survivors of veterans are
              working to persuade Congress to change this law.

   I got a "certificate of eligibility" from VA to buy a home using my GI
     Bill benefits. Then the deal fell through. Do I have to get another
     certificate when I try to buy another home? Is there an expiration
                                    date?
   The "certificate of eligibility" is the form that VA provides to show a
   veteran is eligible for the home loan benefit. Veterans can obtain the
   application for a certificate and information about where to send it by
   calling the VA at 1-800-827-1000. Generally, the certificates are valid
    until used. However, a certificate issued to a person while on active
   duty is only valid while the person remains on active duty. For persons
       qualifying based on service in the reserves or National Guard,
                     eligibility expires Sept. 30, 2007.

    My town has something called a "Vet Center" in a shopping center. Is
                      that a VA program? What's it for?
   Vet Centers are places where combat veterans receive counseling for the
       psychological effects of war. Although they were created in the
    aftermath of the Vietnam War, they are now open to combat veterans of
    all conflicts. VA psychologists, nurses and social workers staff the
      facilities, along with volunteers. The centers have a distinctive
       non-medical, non-government atmosphere that many veterans find
        appealing. Last year, VA operated 206 Vet Centers through its
     Readjustment Counseling Service. The centers saw more than 130,000
            veterans. For more information, call 1-877-222-8387.

        I saw a story recently about coverage increasing for veterans
       insurance. How do I go about getting the new, higher coverage?
     The federal law governing VA's life insurance program says that the
     maximum coverage veterans can receive under the Veterans Group Life
       Insurance (VGLI) program is the maximum amount of coverage they
    purchased during their military days under Servicemembers' Group Life
     Insurance (SGLI). In other words, if you purchased $100,000 in life
   insurance during your active-duty days, VGLI limits you to a maximum of
   $100,000. These limits, of course, don't apply to non-VA insurance that
      veterans might purchase. Under a change that took effect April 1,
    $250,000 is the maximum coverage with SGLI. Veterans who had $250,000
   under SGLI when they discharged after April 1 can purchase $250,000 in
                            coverage under VGLI.

    It used to be that widows and widowers lost their VA pensions if they
                       remarried. Hasn't this changed?
     A change in federal law that took effect Oct. 1, 1998 allows VA to
   resume Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) payments and related
     benefits to former recipients who lost their benefits because they
    remarried. The new law applies to people whether that later marriage
   ended in divorce, annulment or death of the spouse. The current rate is
   $911 for surviving spouses. In some cases, VA can pay more. Other rates
     are paid to eligible children. For information about restoring DIC,
                       call toll-free, 1-800-827-1000.
