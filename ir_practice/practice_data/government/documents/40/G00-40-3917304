   As part of the modernization of the magnetic field models and geospace
   region definitions used in the Satellite Situation Center (SSC)
   software, a radical change was introduced between Versions 2.1 and 2.2
   in terms of the philosophy used to define regions of geospace. Versions
   2.1 and earlier essentially employed a single "index" to identify
   regions, without distinction between regions in space and regions on
   the ionosphere (or ground). Version 2.2, in contrast, involves multiple
   indices to specifically differentiate the region in geospace that the
   satellite resides in, and the (mapped) regions on the ionosphere (or
   ground) that the subsatellite point or magnetic footpoint(s) fall in.
   Thus, the new geospace region definitions involve a family of
   "spacecraft regions," and a family of "mapped regions," as listed
   below:

  Regions of Geospace

   Spacecraft Regions:

     * Interplanetary Medium
     * Dayside Magnetosheath
     * Nightside Magnetosheath
     * Dayside Magnetosphere
     * Nightside Magnetosphere
     * Dayside Plasmasphere
     * Nightside Plasmasphere
     * Plasma Sheet
     * Tail Lobe
     * High Latitude Boundary Layer
     * Low Latitude Boundary Layer

   Mapped Regions:

     * Northern Cusp
     * Southern Cusp
     * Northern Cleft
     * Southern Cleft
     * Northern Auroral Oval
     * Southern Auroral Oval
     * Northern Polar Cap
     * Southern Polar Cap
     * Northern Mid-latitude
     * Southern Mid-latitude
     * Low-latitude

   Users may request, independently, information on any of the four region
   identifier indices:
    1. spacecraft region
    2. radially mapped region (i.e. the subsatellite point)
    3. northern magnetic footprint region
    4. southern magnetic footprint region. Magnetic field traces are
       performed using a user-selectable combination of internal and
       external magnetic field models.

           Regions and Boundaries in the SSC Software: Algorithms

  Spacecraft Regions:

   The Interplanetary Medium, Magnetosheath, and Magnetosphere regions are
   defined by model boundaries for the magnetopause and bow shock
   surfaces.

   For the Magnetopause, the Roelof and Sibeck model (JGR, 98, 21421,
   1993) is employed. The model represents the boundary as a "quadratic
   function" in aberrated GSE coordinates; namely:

                                [mpause.gif]

   where S1, S2 and S3 are functions of the solar wind dynamicd pressure
   Psw and the IMF-Bz component.

   For the Bow Shock, a Modified version of Fairfield's 1971 model (JGR,
   76, 6700, 1971) arranged to move in and out in response to solar wind
   and IMF changes, in unison with the magnetopause, and constrained to
   fixed ratio between the subsolar distances to the bow shock and
   magnetopause, Rbs/Rmp=1.3

                                  [bs.gif]


   The Neutral Sheet definition is based on the current sheet model used
   in new Tsyganenko models (JGR, 100, 5599, 1995). The current sheet
   surface is described by the expression:

                                  [ns.gif]

   where (x,y, z) are aberrated GSM coordinates, psi is the tilt angle,
   and the "scaling" parameters are set to: Rh = 8, d = 4, G=10, Ly = 10.

   The Plasma Sheet model, as labelled in the SSC, is meant to include
   both the plasma sheet (PS) and plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) since
   no community-accepted models exist (as far as we know) to represent
   these regions independently. The PS region is thus defined as a strip
   extending 3 Re above and below current sheet surface.

   The High Latitude Boundary Layer (HLBL) and Low Latitude Boundary Layer
   (LLBL) regions are defined in relation to the magnetopause and neutral
   sheet. Using GSM coordinates, an anular strip of thickness D = D(X) is
   defined inside magnetopause; D widens from 0.4 Re at the terminator to
   4 Re at X=-40 Re, and is held fixed at 4 Re tailward of X=-40 Re.
   Points inside the strip and within 3 Re of the neutral sheet surface
   are labelled as LLBL, while those in the strip but more than 3 Re from
   the neutral sheet are tagged as HLBL.

   The Tail Lobe region is defined as points tailward of the "hinging
   distance" (Rh = 8), inside the tail but not in PS, HLBL or LLBL.

   The following diagram illustrates graphically, the layout of the
   regions described above:

                               [tail_reg.gif]

   The Plasmapause is defined according to the model of Gallagher, et al.,
   (Adv. Space Res. 8, 15, 1988) which represents the plasma density n as
   a function of the L-parameter, the magnetic local time (MLT) and the
   height, h, above the Earth's surface.

                                [ppause.gif]

   In the previous expression, lambda is the geomagnetic latitude. We
   define plasmapause as the surface give by log(n)=1.5 The region
   labelled Magnetosphere corresponds to points inside magnetopause but
   not in other s/c regions.

  Mapped Regions:

   The Cusp and Cleft regions are based on "statistical" description by
   Newell and Meng (JGR, vol. 93, No. A12, pg. 14549, 1988); namely, the
   Cusp is defined as the region MLAT= 75-76 degrees, MLT=09:00-13:00,
   while the Cleft is given by MLAT = 74-78 degrees, MLT=08:00-13:30.

   The Auroral Oval boundaries AOHI and AOLOW are described by:

                                  [ao.gif]

   where C=22.5 degrees if MLTÂ¾22:50 and 337.5 degrees if MLT>22:50;
   S=+/-1 (nightside/dayside).

   Finally, the Mid-latitude and Low-latitude regions are defined in terms
   of ranges in MLAT according to: Mid-lat from MLAT = 30 degrees up to
   the equatorward edge of auroral oval, and Low-lat by MLAT = -30 degrees
   to 30 degrees.

   The various mapped regions are illustrated in the following sketch:
