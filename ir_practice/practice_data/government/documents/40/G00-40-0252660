   Stardust Mission Status January 24, 2002

          NASA's comet-bound spacecraft, Stardust, successfully completed
   a critical deep space maneuver, positioning itself on a course to
   encounter comet Wild 2 in January 2004 and collect dust from the comet.

          At 21:56 Universal Time (1:56 p.m. Pacific Time), January 18,
   Stardust fired its thrusters for nearly 111 seconds, increasing the
   speed of the spacecraft by 2.65 meters per second (about 6 miles per
   hour).

          "This is the maneuver that sets us up for the bigger maneuver.
   It's a combination of increasing the speed of the spacecraft and at the
   same time putting it on the path to reach Wild 2," said Robert Ryan,
   Stardust's mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
   Pasadena, Calif. "It's like the setup pass in a basketball game. Now
   we're ready to shoot the basket."

          The spacecraft responded exactly as planned, said Ryan, although
   communication was tricky. Stardust is currently the farthest
   solar-powered object from the Sun, over 395 million kilometers (245
   million miles) away. The spacecraft's signal confirming it had
   completed the maneuver took almost 30 minutes to reach Earth.

          In January 2004, Stardust will fly through the halo of dust that
   surrounds the nucleus of comet Wild 2. The spacecraft will return to
   Earth in January 2006 to make a soft landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah
   Test and Training Range. Its sample return capsule, holding microscopic
   particles of comet and interstellar dust, will be taken to the
   planetary material curatorial facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center,
   Houston, Texas, where the samples will be carefully stored and
   examined.

          Stardust's cometary and interstellar dust samples will help
   provide answers to fundamental questions about the origins of the solar
   system. More information on the Stardust mission is available at
   http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov .

          Stardust, a part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost, highly
   focused science missions, was built by Lockheed Martin Astronautics and
   Operations, Denver, Colo., and is managed by the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., for NASA's Office of Space Science,
   Washington, D.C. JPL is a division of the California Institute of
   Technology in Pasadena. The principal investigator is astronomy
   professor Donald E. Brownlee of the University of Washington in
   Seattle.
