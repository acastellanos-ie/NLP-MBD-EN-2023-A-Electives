   Slip Opinions In United States Shoe Corp. v. United States, 523 U.S.
   360 118 S. Ct. 1290, 140 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1998), the Supreme Court
   declared unconstitutional the Harbor Maintenance Tax established by 26
   U.S.C. ยง 4461 et seq. as to exports, (affirming 114 F. 3d 1564). See,
   Art. I, Sec. 9, Cl. 5 of the Constitution ("No Tax or Duty shall be
   laid on Articles exported from any State.") The tax is an ad valorem
   charge on exports, imports, other shipments, and passenger
   transportation involving use of a harbor. Numerous cases have been
   filed in the court seeking refund of taxes paid. A refund process is
   nearing completion with respect to taxes collected on exports before
   the tax was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Over 3,000
   claims have been processed.
