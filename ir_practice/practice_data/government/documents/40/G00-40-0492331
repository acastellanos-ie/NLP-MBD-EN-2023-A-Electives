                     [mathilde-t.gif] Why Study Asteroids?

   The scientific interest in asteroids is due largely to their status as
   the remnant debris from the inner solar system formation process.
   Because some of these objects can collide with the Earth, asteroids are
   also important for having significantly modified the Earth's biosphere
   in the past. They will continue to do so in the future. In addition,
   asteroids offer a source of volatiles and an extraordinarily rich
   supply of minerals that can be exploited for the exploration and
   colonization of our solar system in the twenty-first century.

   Asteroids represent the bits and pieces left over from the process that
   formed the inner planets, including Earth. Asteroids are also the
   sources of most meteorites that have struck the Earth's surface and
   many of these meteorites have already been subjected to detailed
   chemical and physical analyses. If certain asteroids can be identified
   as the sources for some of the well-studied meteorites, the detailed
   knowledge of the meteorite's composition and structure will provide
   important information on the chemical mixture, and conditions from
   which the Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago. During the early solar
   system, the carbon-based molecules and volatile materials that served
   as the building blocks of life may have been brought to the Earth via
   asteroid and comet impacts. Thus the study of asteroids is not only
   important for studying the primordial chemical mixture from which the
   Earth formed, these objects may hold the key as to how the building
   blocks of life were delivered to the early Earth.

   On a daily basis, the Earth is bombarded with tons of interplanetary
   material. Many of the incoming particles are so small that they are
   destroyed in the Earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground. These
   particles are often seen as meteors or shooting stars. The vast
   majority of all interplanetary material that reaches the Earth's
   surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have
   run into one another some eons ago. With an average interval of about
   100 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 50 meters would be
   expected to reach the Earth's surface and cause local disasters or
   produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On
   an average of every few hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger
   than a mile could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact
   debris would spread throughout the Earth's atmosphere so that plant
   life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and
   from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back
   down upon the Earth's surface. The probability of an asteroid striking
   the Earth and causing serious damage is very remote but the devastating
   consequences of such an impact suggests we should closely study
   different types of asteroids to understand their compositions,
   structures, sizes, and future trajectories.

   The asteroids that are potentially the most hazardous because they can
   closely approach the Earth are also the objects that could be most
   easily exploited for raw materials. These raw materials could be used
   in developing the space structures and in generating the rocket fuel
   that will be required to explore and colonize our solar system in the
   twenty-first century. By closely investigating the compositions of
   asteroids, intelligent choices can be made as to which ones offer the
   richest supplies of raw materials. It has been estimated that the
   mineral wealth resident in the belt of asteroids between the orbits of
   Mars and Jupiter would be equivalent to about 100 billion dollars for
   every person on Earth today.
