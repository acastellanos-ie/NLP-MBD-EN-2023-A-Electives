                  Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher
             invites you to join The Ultimate Consumer Challenge

                              [lifesmarts.jpg]

   LifeSmarts is an educational game that develops consumer and
   marketplace knowledge and skills of teenagers in a fun way and rewards
   them for this knowledge. The program complements any curriculum in high
   schools and can be used as an activity for classes, groups, clubs, home
   school groups and community organizations. Through the Pennsylvania
   Office of Attorney General's Public Education & Information Unit,
   LifeSmarts is open to all Pennsylvania teens in 9th through 12th
   grades.

             LifeSmarts....are you ready to take the challenge?
   Pennsylvania's LifeSmarts Competition begins: October 1, 2001 and ends
    January 11, 2002. State Finals scheduled for Wednesday, February 27,
                                    2002.

   If you are successful in this LifeSmarts adventure, you and your fellow
   team members may compete in the State LifeSmarts Finals at the Forum
   Building in Harrisburg, February 27, 2002. The winner there will move
   onto the National Competition in Arlington, VA in April.
