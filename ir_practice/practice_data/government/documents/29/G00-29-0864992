   ICESat Spacecraft Illustration

    ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite) is the benchmark EOS
   mission to achieve the ESE/EOS requirements for measuring the ice sheet
    mass balance, cloud and aerosol heights, optical densities, vegetation
                                                      and land topography.
        The EOS ICESat mission will provide cloud property information not
         otherwise available from passive sensors, especially the high ice
    clouds common over polar areas. It will provide a land-topography data
    set by processing the altimeter data throughout its orbit, in addition
                                    to the polar coverage over ice sheets.

   Background:

   The ICESat Mission begins with a launch on a Delta II (Model 7320)
   Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) late in 2002, into a near polar Low
   Earth Orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 600 km with an inclination of 94
   degrees. The spacecraft accommodates the GLAS instrument which is
   currently estimated at a mass not to exceed 300kg and power of 330 W
   (each including 20% contingency), to fully achieve the EOS
   requirements.

   Ball Aerospace, in cooperation with Colorado University/ Laboratory for
   Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)
   , will provide the mission operations for ICESat. This includes a
   Mission Operations Center, a Flight Operations Team, and a Flight
   Dynamics System, all based on systems currently supporting other
   similar missions.

   The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)
   is the sole instrument on the ICESat flight. [wearables.jpg]
