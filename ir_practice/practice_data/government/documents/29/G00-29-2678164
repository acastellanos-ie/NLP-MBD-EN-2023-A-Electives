          Delayed Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury May Improve Recovery

   For release: Saturday, December 01, 2001

Overview

   Rats given an experimental therapy several weeks after their spinal
   cords were severed showed dramatically greater regrowth of nerve fibers
   and recovery of function than rats treated immediately after injury, a
   new study shows. The report suggests that the window of opportunity for
   treating spinal cord injury may be wider than previously anticipated.

   Rats given an experimental therapy several weeks after their spinal
   cords were severed showed dramatically greater regrowth of nerve fibers
   and recovery of function than rats treated immediately after injury, a
   new study shows. The report suggests that the window of opportunity for
   treating spinal cord injury may be wider than previously anticipated.

   The researchers used a combination therapy of fetal spinal tissue
   transplants and nerve growth factors, or neurotrophins. Earlier studies
   in animals have shown that fetal tissue transplants and neurotrophins
   can improve regrowth of injured neurons in the adult spinal cord, and
   that some injured neurons can regrow even after long periods of time.
   However, the new study is the first to show that spinal cord
   regeneration is actually improved when treatment is postponed until
   most of the initial injury-related changes in the rat spinal cord and
   the surrounding environment have stabilized, says Barbara S. Bregman,
   Ph.D., of Georgetown University Medical Center, who led the study. The
   work was supported in part by the National Institute of Neurological
   Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and appears in the December 1, 2001, issue
   of The Journal of Neuroscience.*

   "This is an exciting finding and gives us hope that similar therapies
   may ultimately be useful in humans with severe spinal cord trauma,"
   says Audrey S. Penn, M.D., acting director of NINDS. "The surprising
   and important implication is that therapy may work better if it is
   delayed."

   Dr. Bregman and colleagues studied four groups of adult rats with
   completely severed spinal cords. One group received no treatment and a
   second group received immediate treatment with fetal spinal tissue
   grafts. With the remaining two groups of rats, the wound was cleaned
   out and scar tissue was removed after intervals of either 2 or 4 weeks.
   The rats then received fetal spinal cord tissue grafts. All the rats
   receiving transplants also had infusions of either saline,
   neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) for
   2 weeks after the transplants were completed.

   Differences in motor function between the groups began to emerge 3 to 4
   weeks after the transplants. Animals that received a delayed transplant
   plus treatment with one of the neurotrophins could partially support
   their weight .on their rear legs and had more coordination between the
   front and back legs than animals that received immediate treatment.
   After training, about 20 percent of the animals that received
   transplants plus neurotrophins after a delay were able to consistently
   support their weight while walking, and another 30 percent were able to
   do so some of the time. These animals also were able to support
   themselves on one limb while stepping on stairs. Animals that received
   immediate treatment with the combined therapy could sometimes support
   themselves while walking, but less than rats with the delayed
   treatment. The rats with immediate combined treatment also were unable
   to support themselves during stair-climbing. Animals that received
   transplants without neurotrophins could not support themselves during
   any steps.

   When the rats' spinal cords were examined, most (24 of 27) of the
   animals that received delayed transplants plus neurotrophins had
   regenerated nerve fibers, or axons, that reached the spinal cord below
   the transplant. Compared with animals that received immediate
   treatment, the average axonal growth in animals with delayed treatment
   was more than 6 times greater in white matter (so called because it
   contains nerve fibers coated by a whitish substance called myelin) and
   2.6 times greater in gray matter, which does not contain myelin.
   Surprisingly, the axons below the point of injury regrew into the white
   matter even though previous work has shown that myelin-associated
   inhibitory factors can interfere with axon growth. The pattern of axon
   growth was also better in the rats that received delayed treatment,
   with more branching and larger, more complex axon clusters. The overall
   results were not significantly different in the group treated after 4
   weeks than in the group treated after 2 weeks.

   Although most recovery was seen in animals that regrew fibers across
   the injury site, there was no obvious correlation between the amount of
   fiber regrowth in individual animals and the amount of improved
   function. This suggests that spinal cord circuits can respond to far
   fewer than the normal number of nerve fibers and that there may be
   changes, or plasticity, in connections above and below the point of
   injury that influence the amount of recovery, says Dr. Bregman.

   These findings support previous animal studies showing that combination
   therapy with transplantation and neurotrophins is more effective than
   either approach by itself. While the findings are promising, much more
   research will be necessary before this type of therapy could be tested
   in humans, the researchers say. However, if the results translate to
   the types of spinal cord injuries experienced in human patients, then
   the opportunity for improving function after such a devastating injury
   may be much greater than anyone imagined. Future studies should
   investigate how regeneration and activity may be combined to improve
   recovery, says Dr. Bregman.

   The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health in
   Bethesda, Maryland, and is the nation's primary supporter of biomedical
   research on the brain and nervous system. The Institute is celebrating
   its 50th anniversary this year.
