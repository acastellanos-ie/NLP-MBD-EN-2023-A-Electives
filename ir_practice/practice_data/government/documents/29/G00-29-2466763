               Nonindigenous Tunicate Distribution Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   Tunicates, also called sea squirts, (Phyum Chordata, Subphylum
   Urochordata) have all the characteristics of a chordate but lack a
   backbone, so they are invertebrates. The are usually found in marine
   environments, but a few species are found in fresh water. Some species
   of tunicates are colonial while others are solitary. Tunicates go
   through a free swimming larval stage before settling on the substrate.
   Standard methods of introduction include ship fouling or transportation
   in ballast water of ocean-going vessels. Potential impacts include
   competition with native species for suitable substrate and effects on
   organisms to which they attach. An example of an introduced tunicate is
   the club tunicate, Styela clava (pic 42k). This species was introduced
   into Newport Harbor, California, in the 1920s, where it went unnoticed
   until 1933. By 1949, it was one of the two dominant tunicates in the
   bay. It has replaced the native solitary tunicates in the bay.
