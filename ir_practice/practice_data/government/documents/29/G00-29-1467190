                            MIOCENE TOOTH FOSSILS

   Notidanus primigenius, a skate tooth People often find fossilized teeth
   in the Miocene deposits of Maryland. Fossil shark teeth are commonly
   found at Calvert Cliffs. However, ancient sharks were not the only
   animals leaving behind teeth 5 million years ago. Dentition from fish,
   reptiles, and mammals all occur in the Maryland Miocene.

   Odontaspis cuspidata, a shark tooth We present here a guide to help you
   identify fossil teeth that you might find from Calvert Cliffs, and
   other areas where the Miocene is exposed. These web pages have been
   adapted from the Maryland Geological Survey publication Miocene Text
   and Plates, first published in 1904. This material, long out-of-print
   (available on microfiche only) was written by paleontologists and for
   paleontologists, and it is highly technical. However, the illustrations
   are excellent references for fossil identification. The text is, for
   the most part, unedited from the original volumes.

   This guide is arranged into sections according to the types of animals
   from which the teeth are derived. All of the teeth describe in this
   guide are from vertebrates. They are limited to fish, reptiles and
   mammals. Only fossil teeth are included in the guide. Click on a
   section of the images on the left side of the guide to see an larger
   picture of selected teeth. A copy of the original Miocene distribution
   map from Miocene Text is available in PDF format.
