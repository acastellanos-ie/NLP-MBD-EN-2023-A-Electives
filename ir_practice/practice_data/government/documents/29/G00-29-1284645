                  Funding Opportunities ~ Deadlines ~ News

   Research and education in science and engineering benefit immensely
   from international cooperation. NSF enables and encourages U.S.
   scientists, engineers, and their institutions to avail themselves of
   opportunities to enhance their research and education programs through
   international cooperation. NSF also provides opportunities for future
   generations of U.S. scientists and engineers to gain the experience and
   outlook they will need to function productively in an international
   research and education environment.

   The report International Dimensions of NSF Research and Education,
   which documents FY1997 funding and program information, and highlights
   of accomplishments from NSF international activities is now available.

   The NSF supports international research and education through a variety
   of programs that include:
     * Fellowships
     * Travel grants
     * Summer Institutes
     * Workshops
     * Research and education projects
     * Antarctic projects
