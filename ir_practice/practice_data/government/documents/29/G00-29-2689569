  [Red bullet] What is TEKTRAN?
       TEKTRAN summaries on the Internet are "snapshots in time" --
       selected pre-publication notices -- of recent research results from
       the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of
       Agriculture. You can search TEKTRAN to glimpse the future of food
       and nutrition, crops and livestock, natural resources, and
       industrial products and technology. You can also read breaking news
       in biology, chemistry, and other sciences. We update TEKTRAN
       regularly -- adding summaries of new articles that scientists have
       submitted for publication and removing summaries after three years.
       We exclude some summaries to protect potential patents.
       Return to the TEKTRAN menu.

  [Red bullet] How to Search TEKTRAN?
       Search full text or specific fields of the TEKTRAN record, i.e.
       title, author, interpretive summary, and contact (location) to find
       ARS research in TEKTRAN.
          + To NARROW your search select AND, i.e.: barley AND nitrogen.
          + To EXPAND your search select OR, i.e.: bison OR buffalo.
          + To EXCLUDE a term from your search use AND NOT, i.e.:
            pesticides AND NOT alachlor.
       Truncation: Add an asterisk (*) to the end of words to include
       plurals, i.e.: "librar*" will locate documents containing the terms
       "library", "libraries", as well as "librarians".
       Maximum Number of Hits sets the number or records to be displayed.
       The forst records displayed have the highest relevance to your

  [Red bullet] How to Obtain TEKTRAN Reports
       TEKTRAN reports contain authors names, addresses, fax numbers, and
       emails. Please use the contact information to convey to researchers
       your interest in specific scientific articles. The researchers may
       send reprints of articles, or they may give you the correct journal
       titles and the volume numbers and dates so you can get the articles
       from your local library.
       If the articles you need have not been published yet, ask the
       researchers for the technical summaries.
       ARS encourages the food and fiber research and business communities
       to use TEKTRAN to locate new research findings prior to their
       publication, and to identify fruitful areas of collaboration with
       Agency scientists.
       Kids intrigued by food and agricultural sciences or involved in
       science fair projects should investigate an alternative to
       TEKTRAN--the ARS Science for Kids (Sci4Kids) Web site. It is
       interactive, plus it provides creative ideas and assistance for 8
       to 13 year olds.
       For help with general agricultural questions please contact the NAL
       Reference Unit.
