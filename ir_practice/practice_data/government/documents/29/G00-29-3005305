   The SeaTac Council makes policy, land use and budget decisions to be
   carried out by the City Manager.  The Council's mission as policy-maker
   is to assist the City of SeaTac in becoming economically strong,
   environmentally sensitive, visually pleasing and people-oriented with a
   socially diverse but cohesive population and employment mix.  These
   attributes create a positive identity and image for the community and
   contribute to a City that works for its citizens.
