          We hope that most of the material in the PUMAS Web Site is easy
          to use. If you have suggestions or comments that might help us
          improve the Site, please let us know.

          Parts of this help page discuss some technical aspects related
          to accessing PUMAS. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources
          to give technical advice on an individual basis, but here are
          suggestions for dealing with a few of the more frequently
          encountered problems. If you need further help, please contact
          your local systems expert.

          1. Navigating the PUMAS Web Site

          The PUMAS Web Site is organized to serve three kinds of
          Participants:

          + Users searching for PUMAS Examples.
          + Contributors submitting new Examples.
          + Reviewers submitting Reviews.

          There are two subsidiary functions, the "Examples Wanted"
          bulletin board, where teachers looking for examples not in the
          PUMAS Collection can post their requests, and this Help file.

                Here is a map of the main pathways through the PUMAS Web
                Site. Click on any of the green areas to move to that
                location:

          [ISMAP:sitemap.gif]

          All five paths can be reached from the PUMAS Home Page, and from
          the "footer" that appears at the bottom of every page in the
          PUMAS Web Site. The footer also provides access to the Home
          Page, the PUMAS Copyright statement, and the e-mail boxes of the
          PUMAS Editor and Web Curator. [Please direct comments on the
          content or organization of the pages to the Editor, whereas
          comments on the operation of the Site go to the Curator.]

          Other Things You Can Do At the PUMAS Web Site:

          + Read "Welcome to PUMAS!", an introduction.
          + Volunteer for the pool of PUMAS Reviewers.
          + View the Table of Math Skills by Grade Group.
          + View the Table of Thinking and Learning Skills by Grade Group.
          + Review what is expected of students in each Math and Science
            area, as summarized by the Curriculum Topic Benchmarks.

          If You've Used PUMAS Before, You Might:

          + Update your PUMAS participant information.
          + Fill out the Teachers' On-line Assessment Form.

          Also Available at this Web Site:

          + The PUMAS Masthead.
          + The PUMAS Acknowledgments Page.
          + The PUMAS Copyright Statement.

          2. Accessing the PUMAS Web Site

          If you're just starting out on the information superhighway, and
          want to know more about the Web and HTML, the Yahoo Web Site is
          a good place to start.

          You need to have "web browser" software installed and running on
          your computer to access PUMAS. The PUMAS Web Site is designed to
          be viewed with any web browser that supports HTML tables,
          including the Netscape or NCSA Mosaic browsers.

          If you do not have a browser, or if you have another browser and
          are unhappy with the results (for example, if some images don't
          come out, the response is slow compared to that of your friends'
          browsers, or things just get hung up as you navigate the PUMAS
          Site), you may wish to contact Netscape Communications or NCSA.
          For educational purposes, both are available free-of-charge over
          the net.

          To access the PUMAS Web Site, find the menu item or button in
          your browser software with words such as "Open," "Open
          Location," or "Load URL" , and type:

                          http://pumas.jpl.nasa.gov

          3. Once You're In

          Once you have reached PUMAS and your browser is working
          properly, certain words will appear underlined and in a
          different color, and some images will have colored borders.
          These indicate hyperlinks. Click on the word or image, and you
          will find related material, such as definitions of terms,
          follow-on activities, or larger versions of images.

          Also, your browser probably has a button labeled "Back" or " <--
          ". This is often the easiest way to return from a hyperlink.
          Some PUMAS pages also have "Return To:" options at the bottom of
          the page for convenience, and all pages have "footers" with
          hyperlinks to the main sections of the PUMAS Web Site.

          You might want to save the PUMAS Web Site address, so you don't
          need to remember it next time you access. You can do this by
          selecting the "Add Bookmark" menu item in the Netscape browser,
          or the "Add this item" in the "Hotlist" menu in the NCSA Mosaic
          browser, while you are viewing the PUMAS Home Page. Next time
          you want to connect to PUMAS, just select the PUMAS entry in
          your Bookmark or Hotlist menu.

          By the way, if a page becomes garbled, or if an "image missing"
          icon appears where an image should be, pressing the "Reload"
          button or menu item on your browser might correct the problem.

          Most browsers have many other useful features. Explore and
          enjoy...

          4. Viewing PUMAS Examples

          The PUMAS examples themselves are stored in a format called PDF.
          We do this so that the exact text, graphics, and equations for
          each example can be viewed on a wide variety of computers. To
          view PDF files, you need a software tool such as Adobe Acrobat
          Reader installed and running on your computer.

          If you do not have a copy of Acrobat Reader, you may download it
          free of charge from the Adobe Web Site. Once you select your
          computer type and press "OK" at the Adobe Site, you may be given
          several options. The choices have to do with the way the
          software is compressed -- the more compressed, the smaller the
          file that has to be sent to you over the net. Make your choice,
          and one or more files will be placed on your computer's disk.
          These are "self-extracting" files -- click on them, and they
          will automatically uncompress and install the Reader, so you can
          run it on your computer. It is best to restart your computer
          once the Reader is installed, and you should be set to go.

          5. Speed

          Most browsers and operating systems provide "caches" to store
          recently viewed files. If these caches are active on your
          system, you will be able to download an HTML file once, and
          return to it repeatedly during the session without reloading.
          (Note: This doesn't work if you quit the browser and restart
          it.) If your browser is reloading a section each time you view
          it, look into the cache options of your browser and system. (For
          Netscape, the cache location and size are set in one of the
          Preferences panels in the Options menu.)

          If you seem to be waiting a long time for the documents to
          transfer, it's probably due to one of the following: (1) your
          machine is slow; (2) the network your machine is connected to is
          slow; (3) there are a lot of people also using the PUMAS Web
          Site; (4) you have old browser software; or (5) you are
          transferring a lot of material.

          There's not much you can do about (1) or (2), short of getting a
          faster machine and/or an Ethernet connection. If you are
          accessing PUMAS through a modem, your modem OR your internet
          provider's network could be the source of the bottleneck. If (3)
          is the case, you might decide to wait for a less busy time. And
          if you suspect (4), contact Netscape or Mosaic through their Web
          pages (see Section 2 of this help page).

          You may be able to deal with (5) by shutting off the "auto image
          loading" feature on your browser. The transfer speed will
          increase noticeably, and you can still load figures if you
          decide you need them. To find the "auto image loading" control,
          look in the Options menu of your Web browser. (If there is no
          Options menu, look under the menus you do have or look for the
          Preferences.) There should be a button called "Auto Load
          Images," or words to that effect. Turn this feature off. If you
          want to load an image later, you can click and hold the mouse
          button (right button in X windows) over an "unloaded image"
          icon, or click on the "Images" button found on most web browsers
          to load all available images at once.

          [Warning: The "footer" at the bottom of each page, which is used
          to move to other pages, is an image. If you turn off "Auto Load
          Images," you may need to load the footer in order to move around
          the Web Site.]

          Good luck!
