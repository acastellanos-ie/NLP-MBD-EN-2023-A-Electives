                                        Computer Crime and
                               Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS)

                    How to Report Internet-Related Crime

star rule

     Internet-related crime, like any other crime, should be reported to
     appropriate law enforcement investigative authorities at the local,
     state, federal, or international levels, depending on the scope of
     the crime.  Citizens who are aware of federal crimes should report
     them to local offices of federal law enforcement.

     Some federal law enforcement agencies that investigate domestic
     crime on the Internet include: the Federal Bureau of Investigation
     (FBI), the United States Secret Service, the United States Customs
     Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Bureau
     of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).  Each of these agencies has
     offices conveniently located in every state to which crimes may be
     reported.  Contact information regarding these local offices may be
     found in local telephone directories.  In general, federal crime may
     be reported to the local office of an appropriate law enforcement
     agency by a telephone call and by requesting the "Duty Complaint
     Agent."

     Each law enforcement agency also has a headquarters (HQ) in
     Washington, D.C., which has agents who specialize in particular
     areas.  For example, the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service both have
     headquarters-based specialists in computer intrusion (i.e., computer
     hacker) cases.  In fact, the FBI HQ hosts an interagency center, the
     National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), created just to
     support investigations of computer intrusions.  The NIPC Watch
     number for reporting computer crimes is 202-323-3205.  The U.S.
     Secret Services Electronic Crimes Branch may be reached at
     202-406-5850.  The FBI and the Customs Service also have specialists
     in intellectual property crimes (i.e., copyright, software, movie,
     or recording piracy, trademark counterfeiting).  Customs has a
     nationwide toll-free hotline for reporting at 800-BE-ALERT, or
     800-232-2538.

     The FBI investigates violations of federal criminal law generally.
     Certain law enforcement agencies focus on particular kinds of
     crime.  Other federal agencies with investigative authority are the
     Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
     Commission.

     Many state and local entities also investigate and prosecute
     computer-related crimes. The National Association of Attorneys
     General (http://www.naag.org) has compiled a list of prosecutors and
     investigators from state and local law enforcement agencies who are
     responsible for the investigation and prosecution of computer and
     computer-related crime within their respective jurisdictions. More
     information on the NAAG's Computer Crime Point-of-Contact List CCPC
     is available from the NAAG website. (Please note that this list has
     been compiled for the use of law enforcement and prosecutors, and
     that many of the contacts on the CCPC list are not authorized to
     respond to general questions of law from the public or to provide
     legal advice on specific issues and cases. Members of the public
     seeking to report a crime, or seeking assistance relating to the
     investigation or prosecution of a computer crime, may contact the
     police department within the county, state, or other jurisdiction
     where the criminal activity is occurring, or the FBI.)

     agencies that may be appropriate for reporting certain kinds of
     crime, please refer to the following table:
