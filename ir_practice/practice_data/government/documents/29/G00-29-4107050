                                  United States Department of Commerce
                                        Office of General Counsel
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Ethics Division
         Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Administration
     __________________________________________________________________

   The General Counsel serves as the Designated Agency Ethics Official
   (DAEO) for the Department of Commerce and the Assistant General Counsel
   for Administration serves as the Alternate DAEO. The Ethics Division
   assists these officials in operating the Department's ethics program
   and providing legal services relating to ethics issues.

   Financial Disclosure Program. By law, all SES employees, Schedule C
   employees, and Presidential appointees must file public financial
   disclosure reports (SF 278s); there are approximately 600 SF 278s filed
   per year. In addition, all procurement officials and employees with
   significant responsibilities which could affect members of the public
   must file confidential financial disclosure reports (SF 450s); there
   are approximately 6,000 SF 450s filed per year. The Ethics Division has
   assumed almost all responsibilities with respect to notifying employees
   of the filing requirement and distributing blank forms to file,
   collecting the reports, and reviewing and clearing the reports.

   In addition to collecting and reviewing reports of regular Department
   employees, the Ethics Division is responsible for the financial
   disclosure reports filed by special Government employees (employees
   serving 130 days or less per year)--including members of Federal
   Advisory Committees--and members of some Presidential boards and
   commissions. These are usually important persons in the private sector
   who need to be advised of the ethics rules and their responsibilities
   in filing reports and avoiding conflicts of interest.

   Ethics Training Program. By regulation, the Department must annually
   provide a one-hour live training session to all employees who file
   financial disclosure reports or who are procurement officials, unless
   providing the training for a particular individual is considered
   administratively burdensome. Topics covered in the training include:
   financial conflicts of interest, outside employment and non-financial
   conflicts of interest, gifts and bribes, misuse of Government
   resources, financial disclosure, political activities, and post
   employment restrictions. Other training programs are also presented to
   Department employees.

   Advisory responsibilities. The Ethics Division provides opinions to
   employees on conflict of interest statutes, standards of conduct, gift
   regulations, political activity restrictions, and other ethics and
   related administrative law issues.

   The Ethics Division also helps prepare materials for Presidential
   Appointee Senate nomination hearings, including letters to the Senate
   and Office of Government Ethics advising that a nominee's appointment
   does not present an ethics problem, letters to the Senate Committee
   holding the first hearing updating the Committee on earned income
   information from the nominee, ethics agreements for each nominee,
   disqualification statements for nominees, and conflict of interest
   waivers for nominees, when necessary. We advise employees on the ethics
   rules in general and any specific issues with regard to the nominee's
   financial interests or activities.
