   The National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS) are a set of surveys designed
   to gather information at multiple points in time on the labor market
   activities and other significant life events of several groups of men
   and women. For more than 3 decades, NLS data have served as an
   important tool for economists, sociologists, and other researchers.

                            People are asking...

               1. How many jobs do people hold in a lifetime?

             2. Is the NLSY97 Rd 3 event history data available?

       3. How do I get a "taste" of the data without ordering the CD?
