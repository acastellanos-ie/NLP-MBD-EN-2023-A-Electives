                         Public Debt FOIA Home Page
     __________________________________________________________________


   There is a whole lot of information right here on our website about the
   public debt and the Treasury securities we sell. We've got information
   about T-bills, notes, and bonds, savings bonds, and other special
   securities. You can also find a lot of public debt statistics. There's
   an index too that you can check out and you can also do a quick search
   of our site. After you look around on your own, if you don't find what
   you want to know about us, send us an e-mail.

   You just might find all the information you're looking for here without
   having to make a formal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and
   paying a fee. If you do want to make a FOIA request, here's what's
   involved:
