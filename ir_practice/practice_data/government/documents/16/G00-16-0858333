   NWHIC's Body Image section is updated with the latest information and
   resources. As busy women living complex lives, we are sometimes
   overwhelmed by the amount of health information and misinformation in
   the media and on the Internet. This web page has been designed by the
   National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) to provide women
   with information they can trust about how to stay well and feel good
   about ourselves.

   NWHIC's Healthy Pregnancy section has been rewritten and updated with
   the latest information, including a new Glossary of Pregnancy-related
   Terms. The National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) has
   created this site for expectant mothers. It provides resources about
   each trimester of pregnancy, fertility and contraception, preparing for
   the new baby, childbirth, postnatal and postpartum care, and financial
   assistance.

   A Virtual Resource Center has been added to the National Centers of
   Excellence (CoE) in Women's Health web site. The Virtual Resource
   Center contains descriptions of a wide array of programs, activities,
   seminars, and community collaborations developed by the CoEs. If you
   are thinking about planning a program on a specific health topic or
   just trying to do something different in your community, search here
   for creative ideas that are working for the CoEs. Why reinvent the
   wheel?
