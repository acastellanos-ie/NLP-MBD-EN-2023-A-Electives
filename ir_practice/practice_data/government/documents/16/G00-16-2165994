     New NASA/CSA Monitor Provides Global Air Pollution View from Space

                 Terra shots of pollution across the Pacific

   The most complete view ever assembled of the world's air pollution
   churning through the atmosphere and crossing continents and oceans has
   been produced by NASA's Terra spacecraft.
   Policymakers and scientists now have, for the first time, a way to
   identify the major sources of air pollution and closely track where the
   pollution goes all year round and anywhere on Earth.  Click for more on
   this story.
