About the Catalog

What's in the Catalog?

   This database contains bibliographic records for the majority of items
   in the Reading Room collection. The collection consists primarily of
   technical reports related to current and historical operations at the
   Hanford Site. The catalog has some Hanford-related articles from
   various journals, but we do not subscribe to any journals and rarely
   have any correspondence. (For a more detailed description of what is in
   the Reading Room collection, see the Reading Room Home Page). As of
   April 2001, there were over 23,500 records in the catalog. Generally,
   all items with document numbers get added to the catalog and as soon as
   a document has been added, it shows up in this database.

   Please note that NOT EVERYTHING in the Reading Room collection has been
   entered into the catalog. The types of materials in the Reading Room
   but NOT in the catalog are:

     * DOE Orders
     * Unusual and Off-Normal Occurrence Reports
     * Newsclippings
     * Press Releases
     * Individual Plant Force Work Reviews
     * Newsletters
     * Factsheets
     * Materials Relating to the Handord Advisory Board Meetings
     * Tri-Party Agreement Information Repository Materials Without
       Document Numbers

   If you have any questions about these materials, please contact the
   Reading Room staff.

Description of Fields in the Reading Room Catalog


    Accession Number unique number, sequentially assigned by Reading Room
                staff when items are entered into the catalog
   Document Number identifying number given to the report, usually by the
       originator; not all items in the catalog have a document number
   Alternate Doc. Num. any alternate document numbers that the report may
                                    have
      No. Pages how many pages the document is (sometimes this field is
        blank, which means that the page count has not been done yet)
   Document Title the title, as it appears on the document; if a document
   is known by a common or unofficial title, that is listed in parentheses
                 or quote marks, i.e. "Tri-Party Agreement"
      Date Published date the document was issued, as it appears on the
  document; if only the year is given, thats all thats entered into the
                catalog; this field may occasionally be blank
    Date Placed in Reading Room date the report was added to the Reading
   Room collection; it is not necessarily entered into the catalog on that
   same day. This field was not used until January 1, 1998, so if there is
     no date listed in this field, it means the report was placed in the
               Reading Room collection before January 1, 1998.
    Document Notes any miscellaneous but pertinent information about the
           document (such as format); this field is NOT searchable
      URL of the Document if the Reading Room is aware of an electronic
     version of the document, the URL where it can be located is listed
   here; by clicking in this box in the search form (without entering any
   other search criteria), it is possible to get a list of all the reports
                         we have specific URLs for.
                              Document Category

   a category assigned by Reading Room staff to selected records, this is
      an optional field, which is usually blank; currently there are 5
                              categories used:
    1. Hanford-related Environmental Impact Statements & Environmental
       Assessments
    2. Accident/Investigation Reports
    3. Human Test Subject Reports
    4. Requested Under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
    5. Finding Aids

     Author name(s) of individuals who wrote the document; currently all
     authors are entered, but in the past only the first 3 authors were
     listed; many documents do not have personal authors listed; author
     names are listed alphabetically, not necessarily in the order that
                          appears on the document.
   Corporate Author entity that created the document; usually this is the
    organization that the writer of the report worked for, but not always
     Journal Name title of journal if the document is an article from a
                                   journal
                   Shelving Location & Location Extension

    location on the Reading Room shelves where the document is physically
                     located; there may be more than one

     location if the Reading Room has multiple copies of the same report
   (usually these would be in different formats, i.e. paper or microfiche)

Electronic Versions of Reports

   Each URL listed in the Reading Room catalog is checked for accuracy at
   the time it is entered into the catalog and at regular intervals, but
   these Internet addresses are external to the DOE-RL Public Reading Room
   and we are not responsible for the content, accessibility or currency
   of these sites.

   We have tried to include URLs for as many reports as we can find.
   Although we are constantly adding them to catalog records, full text
   reports are being made available everyday and despite our best efforts,
   we can't possibly keep up with all of them. As of April 2001, there are
   links to over 2,600 full text reports.

   When possible, we have entered the specific URL for the actual report.
   However, in some cases, you may only get to a preliminary page and have
   to either scroll through a list to find the specific report or have to
   perform a search in that system by entering the document number.

   Not every report in the Reading Room catalog that is available
   electronically has a URL listed; electronic versions of the following
   types of reports are likely to be found at the sites listed in the
   table below:

   Reports that are part of the Hanford Tri-Party Agreement Administrative
   Record or Public Information Repository http://www2.hanford.gov/arpir/
            DNFSB (Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board) reports
                      http://www.dnfsb.gov/document.htm
   GAO (General Accounting Office) reports http://www.gao.gov/reports.htm
       BHI numbered reports http://www.bhi-erc.com/library/library.htm
   Reports in the "Human Test Subjects" category http://hrex.dis.anl.gov/
           Hanford-generated documents that have been declassified
              http://www2.hanford.gov/declass/d20pydeclass.asp
       DOE Information Bridge includes DOE-sponsored report literature
       produced by the DOE and DOE contractor research and development
      community received and processed by the Office of Scientific and
    Technical Information since January 1995 http://www.osti.gov/bridge/

   For additional Internet sites that have full text reports, see the
   Hanford Technical Library Electronic Documents page at:
   http://www.pnl.gov/tech_lib/edocs.htm.

   Be aware that when clicking on a URL to go to the full text of a
   report, sometimes, depending on how a site is set up, it may not be
   possible to return to the list of Reading Room catalog search results
   by clicking on your browser's BACK button.

How to Obtain Copies of Reports in the Reading Room Catalog

   The Reading Room collection is non-circulating and all materials are
   intended for use within the Reading Room. The collection is not
   available for interlibrary loan. Although we are not a copy center, we
   can often provide copies of many of the items in the collection. There
   are some things we cannot copy because they are copyright protected or
   too large for us to handle. Currently, we do not have the capability to
   duplicate large maps or plates. If we are unable to provide a copy, we
   are usually able to refer you elsewhere for a copy.

   If we have extra copies on hand, well provide those for no charge. If
   we have to make up a copy, there is usually a duplication fee. Please
   contact the Reading Room staff for current prices. It is Reading Room
   policy to require payment in advance before sending out copies.

What Information to Include When Requesting Reports

   The more complete the request is, the faster we can respond to it.
   Including the following information (for each document requested) will
   expedite the process:
    1. accession number
    2. document number (if there is one)
    3. title
    4. page count (if its specified in the catalog)
    5. all the document locations (including extensions) listed

   Of course, well also need your name and a way to contact you to let
   you know the cost of filling your request. Well try to have your
   request ready to be sent out by the time we receive your payment.
