   Dear Friends,

   I have temporarily changed my Website greeting page to provide more
   information regarding the recent terrorist attacks. Please follow the
   following links for information on how to help or how to find out about
   a missing friend or relative in New York, NY or Washington, DC.

   I encourage everyone in this trying time to please fly an American flag
   at your home, in your car, or at your office. I hope you will join me
   in this symbol of Unity.

   Let's do this together as a sign of remembrance to those who may have
   lost their lives, as a symbol of comfort for those who may have lost
   someone, and as a signal to those who committed this atrocity that
   America will recover and will emerge stronger then ever before. Our
   American spirit will not be broken!

   I hope you will find the information provided here helpful and
   informative. We are continually updating the material, so please visit
   often. I also invite you to use the comment section of the guestbook to
   let me know what's on your mind.

                       Please email me:   [letter.gif]
