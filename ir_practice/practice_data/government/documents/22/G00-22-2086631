          Services for Americans living in Saudi Arabia include the
          following:

        Passport replacement
                In the event that a passport is lost or stolen, or if a
                new passport is needed, the Consular Section can issue a
                replacement in two business days. If you believe your
                passport has been stolen, first report the theft to the
                local police and get a police declaration. Replacement
                passports cost $55 if the applicant is still in possession
                of the old passport, $60 without the old passport, and $40
                for minors under the age of 16.
                In order to obtain a replacement passport, you will need
                the following:

                      - proof of U.S. citizenship (previous passport,
                      birth certificate, naturalization papers, previous
                      registration with the Consulate General, or other
                      documentation)
                      - two 2" x 2" (5 cm x 5 cm) photo with a white
                      background
                      - application form completely filled out
                      - application fee

                Passport applications are received in the Consular Section
                during normal hours of operation.

        Assistance in finding medical help
                If you become sick or hurt, you may contact a consular
                officer for a list of local doctors, dentists, and medical
                specialists. If you are injured or become seriously ill, a
                consul will help you find medical assistance and, at your
                request, inform your family or friends.

        Assistance in getting funds
                Should you lose all your money and other financial
                resources, consular officers can help you contact your
                family, bank, or employer to arrange for them to send you
                money.

        Help in an emergency
                In the event that your family needs to reach you because
                of an emergency at home or because they are worried about
                your welfare, they should call the State Department's
                Citizens Emergency Center at (202) 647-5225. The State
                Department will relay the message to consular officers in
                the country in which you are traveling. Consular officers
                will try to locate you, pass on urgent messages, and,
                consistent with the Privacy Act, report back to your
                family.

        Visit in jail
                If you are arrested, you should ask the authorities to
                notify a U.S. consul. Consuls cannot get you out of jail.
                You are in a foreign country and are subject to its laws.
                Consuls, however, can work to protect your legitimate
                interests and ensure that you are not discriminated
                against. They can provide a list of local attorneys, visit
                you, and contact your family and friends.

        Making arrangements after the death of an American citizen
                When an American dies abroad, a consular officer notifies
                the American's family and informs them about options and
                costs for disposition of remains. Costs for preparing and
                returning a body to the U.S. may be expensive and must be
                paid by the family.

        Notarization
                Notarization services are provided for a fee of $55.

        Immigrant visa petition acceptance
                If you have a non-American immediate relative (spouse,
                child, or parent), you can file a petition for immigration
                in the Consular Section. All further processing is done at
                the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh's Immigrant Visa Section.
                Immigrant visa petition forms are available for pick up in
                the Consular Section during normal hours of operation..

        The consular section can also:

                      - issue a Consular Report of Birth Abroad,
                      - distribute federal benefit payments,
                      - handle personal estates of deceased U.S. citizens,
                      - assist with absentee voting and Selective Service
                      registration,
                      - provide U.S. tax forms.

        Consular officers cannot act as travel agents, banks, lawyers,
                investigators, or law enforcement officers. Please do not
                expect them to find employment for you, obtain residence
                or driving permits, act as interpreters, search for
                missing luggage, or settle disputes with hotel managers.
                Consular officers may, however, advise you on where to
                obtain assistance on these and other matters.

        In order to allow the consular section to better help and serve
                you, please register with the Consulate as soon as you
                arrive in the country.
