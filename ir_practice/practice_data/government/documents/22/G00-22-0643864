   Dear Colleague:

   We are initiating a national search for the National Science
   Foundation's Assistant Director for Computer and Information Science
   and Engineering (CISE), and seek your assistance in the identification
   of candidates. Dr. Ruzena Bajcsy will be completing her assignment in
   this position this summer, having served in this position with
   distinction since December 1998. Her departure upon her return to the
   University of Pennsylvania will be a loss to the Foundation.

   The Assistant Director, CISE, manages a Directorate comprised of five
   divisions: Computer-Communications Research, Information and
   Intelligent Systems, Advanced Networking Infrastructure and Research,
   Advanced Computational Infrastructure and Research, and Experimental
   and Integrative Activities. Enclosed is an information sheet which
   summarizes the Directorate's activities and the responsibilities of the
   position, together with the criteria that will be used in the search.
   Employment may be on a temporary or permanent basis in the Federal
   Service or by temporary assignment under provisions of the
   Intergovernmental Personnel Act.

   We are very pleased to announce that Dr. John Hennessy, President,
   Stanford University, has agreed to head the Screening Committee. Both
   we and the Committee seek your help in identifying candidates with the
   following qualifications: outstanding leadership; a deep sense of
   scholarship; a grasp of the issues facing computer and information
   science and engineering in education and research; and the ability to
   serve effectively as a key member of the NSF management team. We are
   especially interested in identifying women, members of minority groups,
   and persons with disabilities for consideration. Recommendations of
   individuals from any sector -- academic, industry, or government -- are
   welcome.

   Please send your recommendations, including any supporting information
   which you might be able to provide, to the AD/CISE Screening Committee
   via e-mail (cisesrch@nsf.gov) or at the following address: National
   Science Foundation, Office of the Director, Suite 1205, 4201 Wilson
   Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230. We would appreciate receiving your
   recommendations by June 22, 2001.

   Your assistance in this very important task is appreciated.

                                                                  <signed>
                                                           Rita R. Colwell
                                                                  Director
