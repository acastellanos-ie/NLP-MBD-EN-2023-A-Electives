   Enter search terms in the space below. Phrases must be in quotation
   marks (" "). The operators ADJ (adjacent), AND, OR and NOT can be used,
   but must be in capital letters. For example: "prescriptions" AND "drug
   enforcement administration". You can search for a CFR citation by
   surrounding it with quotation marks, for example "20CFR404.1576". If
   you are not sure of the exact CFR citation you can truncate the

   example, "20CFR404". Helpful hints are available in HTML as an aid for
   developing search terms.
