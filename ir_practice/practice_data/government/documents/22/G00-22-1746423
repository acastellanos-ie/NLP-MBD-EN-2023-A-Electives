     NASA is building a new instrument, the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder
      (AIRS), to make highly accurate measurements of air temperature,
    humidity, clouds, and surface temperature. The data collected by AIRS
      will be used by scientists around the world to better understand
    weather and climate, and by the National Weather Service and NOAA to
   improve the accuracy of their weather and climate models. AIRS will fly
       aboard the AQUA spacecraft of the Earth Observing System (EOS),
           scheduled for launch early in the twenty-first century.

   tests conducted at TRW. The AIRS, AMSU-A1, AMSU-A2 and HSB hardware are
                                 identified.
