                             NETSCAPE 6.0 USERS
                          POTENTIAL VIEWING ISSUES

   For those of you that have downloaded and installed Netscape 6.0 - be
       advised that the SBA main home page banner, and some other things
       on our websites may not work for you unless you download the "Full"
       version of Netscape 6.0 that includes java elements. Netscape's
       default download selection of "Recommended" does not give you java
       elements needed to view all things on our, and perhaps other web
       sites that utilize java scripting.
