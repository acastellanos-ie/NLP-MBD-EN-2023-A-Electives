   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recognized as
   the lead federal agency for protecting the health and safety of people
   - at home and abroad, providing credible information to enhance health
   decisions, and promoting health through strong partnerships. CDC serves
   as the national focus for developing and applying disease prevention
   and control, environmental health, and health promotion and education
   activities designed to improve the health of the people of the United
   States.

   CDC, located in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, is an agency of the Department
   of Health and Human Services. Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan is the Director.

   CDC's Vision for the 21st Century
   Healthy People in a Healthy World Through Prevention

   At CDC, we work hard to make people safer and healthier. By charting
   decisive courses of action, collecting the right information, and
   working closely with other health and community organizations, CDC has
   been putting science into action to tackle important health problems
   since 1946. With more than 8,500 employees across the country, CDC
   plays a critical role in protecting the public from the most
   widespread, deadly and mysterious threats against our health today and
   tomorrow.

                                                                    TO TOP

   CDC's Mission
   To promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling
   disease, injury, and disability.

   CDC seeks to accomplish its mission by working with partners throughout
   the nation and world to monitor health, detect and investigate health
   problems, conduct research to enhance prevention, develop and advocate
   sound public health policies, implement prevention strategies, promote
   healthy behaviors, foster safe and healthful environments, and provide
   leadership and training.

   CDC has developed and sustained many vital partnerships with public and
   private entities that improve service to the American people. In FY
   2000, the workforce of CDC comprised approximately 8,500 FTE in 170
   disciplines with a public health focus. Although CDC's national
   headquarters is in Atlanta, Georgia, more than 2,000 CDC employees work
   at other locations, including 47 state health departments.
   Approximately 120 are assigned overseas in 45 countries. CDC includes
   12 Centers, Institutes, and Offices.

                                                                    TO TOP

   CDC Protects Health and Safety

   Infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, have the
   ability to destroy lives, strain community resources, and even threaten
   nations. In today's global environment, new diseases have the potential
   to spread across the world in a matter of days, or even hours, making
   early detection and action more important than ever. CDC plays a
   critical role in controlling these diseases, traveling at a moment's
   notice to investigate outbreaks abroad or at home.

   But disease outbreaks are only the beginning of our protective role. By
   assisting state and local health departments, CDC works to protect the
   public every day: from using innovative "fingerprinting" technology to
   identify a foodborne illness, to evaluating a family violence
   prevention program in an urban community; from training partners in HIV
   education, to protecting children from vaccine preventable diseases
   through immunizations.

   Examples of CDC action

                                                                    TO TOP

   CDC Provides Credible Information to Enhance Health Decisions

   We recognize that the best, most up-to-date health information is
   meaningless unless it is meaningful and accessible to the people it is
   meant to serve. By working with public health and grassroots partners,
   and by leveraging the voices of the internet, and communication media,
   we ensure the best health and safety information is accessible to the
   communities and people who need it every day.

   Examples of CDC action

                                                                    TO TOP

   CDC Promotes Health through Strong Partnerships

   The everyday world provides a series of obstacles to continued good
   health: pollution and congestion in the air we breathe; contamination
   in our water supply; unsafe conditions in our daily workplaces. CDC
   works side by side with national, state and local organizations to help
   protect communities from dangerous environmental exposures. We may feel
   secure in our own health. But regardless of how vigilant we might be,
   the fact remains: in every town, in every community, and in every
   family, we are vulnerable to hazards in our environment, in our
   workplace, and even in our home.

   CDC alone cannot protect the health of the American people. However, by
   engaging with others from state and local health departments to private
   corporations, from media outlets to the general public we can achieve
   our vision of a better world, with safer, healthier people.

   Examples of CDC action

                                                                    TO TOP

   Future Challenges

   Challenges that CDC faces in the future are highlighted below. CDC's
   mission and programs clearly focus upon these challenges. Specific
   action steps for each challenge are described briefly.

   Improving People's Health by Putting Science into Action
   Preventing Violence and Unintentional Injury
   Meeting the Health and Safety Needs of a Changing Workforce
   Utilizing New Technologies to Provide Credible Health Information
   Protecting Individuals against Emerging Infectious Diseases including
   Bioterrorism
   Eliminating Racial/Ethnic Health Disparities
   Fostering Safe and Healthy Environments
   Working with Partners to Improve Global Health

                                                                    TO TOP

   CDC Organization

   The CDC is one of the major operating components of the Department of
   Health and Human Services. CDC's major organizational components
   respond individually in their areas of expertise and pool their
   resources and expertise on cross-cutting issues and specific health
   threats. The agency is comprised of these organizational components:

   National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities
   (NCBDDD) provides national leadership for preventing birth defects and
   developmental disabilities and for improving the health and wellness of
   people with disabilities.

   National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
   (NCCDPHP) prevents premature death and disability from chronic diseases
   and promotes healthy personal behaviors.

   National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) provides national
   leadership in preventing and controlling disease and death resulting
   from the interactions between people and their environment.

   National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides statistical
   information that will guide actions and policies to improve the health
   of the American people.

   National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP) provides
   national leadership in preventing and controlling human
   immunodeficiency virus infection, sexually transmitted diseases, and
   tuberculosis.

   National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID) prevents illness,
   disability, and death caused by infectious diseases in the United
   States and around the world.

   National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) prevents
   death and disability from nonoccupational injuries, including those
   that are unintentional and those that result from violence.

   National Immunization Program (NIP) prevents disease, disability, and
   death from vaccine-preventable diseases in children and adults.

   National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) ensures
   safety and health for all people in the workplace through research and
   prevention.

   Epidemiology Program Office (EPO) strengthens the public health system
   by coordinating public health surveillance; providing support in
   scientific communications, statistics, and epidemiology; and training
   in surveillance, epidemiology, and prevention effectiveness.

   Public Health Practice Program Office (PHPPO) strengthens community
   practice of public health by creating an effective workforce, building
   information networks, conducting practice research, and ensuring
   laboratory quality.

   CDC performs many of the administrative functions for the Agency for
   Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a sister agency of CDC,
   and one of eight federal public health agencies within the Department
   of Health and Human Services. The Director of CDC also serves as the
   Administrator of ATSDR.
