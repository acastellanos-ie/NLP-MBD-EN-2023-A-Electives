   Nanotechnology


   Nanotechnology

   Nanotechnology refers to the assembly of individual atoms, molecules,
   or molecular clusters into minute structures.

           Nanotechnology refers to the manipulation or self-assembly of
      individual atoms, molecules, or molecular clusters into structures with
        dimensions in the 1- to 100-nanometer range to create materials and
        devices with new or vastly different properties. For comparison, a
                   human hair is about 10,000 nanometers thick.

      Scientists believe the ability to move and combine individual atoms and
          molecules will revolutionize the production of virtually every
      human-made object and usher in a new technology revolution at least as
            significant as the silicon revolution of the 20th century.

           Sandia already has used ion-implantation techniques to create
       lightweight aluminum composites that are as strong and durable as the
      best steel available. Nanostructured semiconductor materials created at
        Sandia may enable highly efficient, low power lasers for high-speed
       optical communications. Biosensors that use molecular bundles similar
      to those found in living cells are being created that could warn people
        when traces of chemical or biological warfare agents are detected.

    Z machine, THE most powerful X-ray source.

       Pulsed power technology is used to generate and apply energetic beams
      and high-power energy pulses. It is distinguished by the development of
      repetitive pulsed-power technologies, x-ray and energetic beam sources,
      and electromagnetic and radiation-hydrodynamic codes for a wide variety
                                 of applications.

           Our accomplishments include raising the power output of the Z
      Accelerator by a factor of ten, compared to what was achievable 5 years
      ago, or nearly 100 times the output of all electrical plants on Earth.

         Examples of these applications include nuclear survivability and
      hardness testing, light-ion-beam inertial confinement fusion, materials
        processing, waste and product sterilization, and food purification.
       Facilities include the Saturn x-ray source, the High-Energy Radiation
          Megavolt Electron Source (HERMES) III for gamma rays, and the Z
                                  Accelerator I.
