Introduction

   [loco.gif] Approximately ten kilometers north of the tip of Cape Cod,
   lies Stellwagen Bank; a shallow, submarine platform formed by receeding
   glaciers about 18,000 years ago (figure 1). There has been much
   attention turned to Stellwagen Bank in the last few years since it was
   declared a National Marine Sanctuary by NOAA in June, 1993. The U.S.
   Geological Survey in Woods Hole has taken on the tasks of investigating
   the geology of Stellwagen Bank and determining both the processes that
   formed the bank and those still actively reshaping it.

   The Stellwagen Bank Sea Floor Mapping Project is an organized effort to
   map the surficial geology of Stellwagen Bank using side-scan sonar,
   video, camera and grab sample data. To date, over 1,500 km of side-scan
   sonar data have been collected on the bank in addition to hundreds of
   grab samples and countless hours of video transects. As a final
   product, the USGS intends to produce a series of nineteen U.S.
   Geological Survey Miscellaneous Field Studies Maps that show the
   interpreted surficial geology of the bank. Each map in the series will
   also include a digitally produced, continuous-coverage side-scan sonar
   mosaic (figure 2). Presently, one such digital mosaic is currently
   finished and can be viewed on this server (quad. #4).

   Relatively little is still known about the geology of Stellwagen Bank.
   Recent interpretation of the data in mosaic quadrangle #4 has led to
   the idea that major Nor'Easters have a discernable impact on the bank
   by moving fine grain sand to the southwest (see 1994 GSA abstract). A
   tongue of rippled fine grain sand is visible in mosaic quadrangle #4 as
   a light, triangular shaped area in the north-central part of the mosaic
   (quad. #4), and is thought to be a storm deposit.

   The USGS believes that the Stellwagen Bank Sea Floor Mapping Project
   will help discern the modern geologic processes that are active on the
   bank, and continue to answer some of the questions concerning the
   geological composition, environment, development and history of the
   bank.

Significant Resources

   The Sanctuary surrounds the entire Stellwagen Bank, a glacially
   deposited topographic feature lying in depths of around 65 feet in the
   shallowest areas with other areas in the upper plateau in the 100 foot
   range. The Sanctuary also includes the areas to the north of the Bank
   known as Tilies Bank and Tillies Basin, as well as the Southernmost end
   of Jeffries Ledge. The seaward side of the Bank drops off rapidly to
   over 600 feet. Stellwagen Bank is the most prominent submarine feature
   in Massachusetts Bay, stretching for nearly 20 miles between northern
   Cape Cod and Cape Ann, Massachusetts.

   Two distinct peak productivity periods produce a complex system of
   midwater and benthic habitats. These communities support benthic and
   pelagic species by providing cover and anchoring locations for
   invertebrates; they also provide feeding and nursery grounds for more
   than a dozen cetacean species including the endangered humpback,
   northern right, sei, and fin whales. The area supports foraging
   activity by diverse seabird species, dominated by loons, fulmars,
   shearwaters, storm petrels, cormorants, phalaropes, alcids, gulls,
   jaegers, and terns. Fish and invertebrate populations subject to
   seasonal and migration shifts include both demersal and pelagic
   species, such as bluefin tuna, herring, cod, flounders, lobster, and
   scallops. Leatherback and Atlantic ridley sea turtles (endangered
   species) use the area for feeding. Historic data strongly suggest the
   presence of several shipwreck sites within the Sanctuary, including the
   recently discovered and historically significant wreck of the steamship
   Portland which sunk in 1898.

Human Use and Values

   Commercial fishing is the most economically important activity on the
   bank, though whale-watching has grown steadily since 1976 due to the
   regional access and concentration of cetacean species. Current
   commercial whalewatch activities involve more than half a million
   visitors to the Bank annually. Recreational activities, tourism,
   research, and commercial shipping are other important human uses. Seven
   historic shipwrecks have been identified within or adjacent to the
   boundaries; a complete inventory of historical resources has not been
   conducted. A heavily-used vessel traffic separation lane transports
   more than 2700 commercial vessels in and out of Boston annually.

Site Designation and Regulations

   Stellwagen Bank was designated as a Sanctuary in November 1992 during
   reauthorization of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act
   of 1972. It appeared on the Site Evaluation List in August 1983, and
   was made an Active Candidate in 1989. Final Sanctuary regulations (15
   CRF940) March 1994, includes a number of prohibited activities, like
   the disposal of dredged or other materials and mining for sand and
   gravel within the Sanctuary.
