                               New law makes APIS a must
                            for international air carriers

        The Aviation and Transportation Security Act was signed into law by
        President George W. Bush on November 19. Under the new law,
        international air carriers are required to provide U.S. Customs with an
        electronic manifest detailing the name, date of birth, sex, travel
        document number, and nationality of the document of each passenger and
        crew member before the aircraft lands in the United States. Currently,
        Customs does not receive information on domestic flights, and this new
        law applies only to international air carriers.

        "This new requirement will go a long way in helping the U.S. Customs
        Service identify known or suspected terrorists before they attempt to
        enter our country," says Commissioner Robert C. Bonner. On November 29,
        Bonner requested immediate compliance from all international air
        carriers that do not already make advance passenger information
        available to U.S. Customs.


     "To live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else."

                             Commissioner's Message

       Photo of Commissioner Bonner. This year's holiday season takes on a
      special meaning as we pause to reflect on the events of 2001 that we
       will never forget. The traditional joy of the season will be tinged
         with sadness as we recall the attacks on September 11, and the
                  thousands of lives lost on that terrible day.

        But let us remember that this is also a time of renewal, when we
      celebrate the symbols of hope amidst struggle. And we have witnessed
     many of those  from the heroic actions of firefighters and policemen
        who worked to save lives at "ground zero," to the service of our
      military overseas, to the unity and strength displayed by our country
                          throughout a time of crisis.

     I will also remember the thousands of U.S. Customs employees who stood
         steadfastly on America's frontline after the terrorist attacks,
      protecting our country from further harm. I will remember their many
      sacrifices, the long days they put in and continue to put in, and the
      efforts of all our people at Headquarters and throughout the field to
               restore peace and security to our troubled nation.

      We know that the days ahead will not be easy. U.S. Customs faces some
      of the greatest challenges in its long history of service to America.
       We must continue to carry out our core mission responsibilities 
      protecting and promoting the nation's commerce, safeguarding America
     from the scourge of illegal narcotics, and shielding our citizens from
       the latest forms of crime and fraud - all the while protecting our
                       country against a terrorist threat.

     I know that we will emerge even stronger from this latest test. I know
       that because of the steady commitment and firm resolve I have seen
     displayed by the men and women of Customs to carry on their mission 
     in New York City, where the attacks struck our home, and all along our
                  borders in the days and weeks that followed.

      That dedication is yet another sign of hope  not just for the U.S.
     Customs Service in meeting its future challenges, but for the safety of
         our nation, especially during this season when it is needed and
                                appreciated most.

       I want to take this opportunity to thank all Customs employees for
        their service, and to wish you and your families a very happy and
                             healthy holiday season.
