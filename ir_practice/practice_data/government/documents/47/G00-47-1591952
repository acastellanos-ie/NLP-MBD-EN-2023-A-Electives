   Subject:     Hydrologist and Hydrologic Technician Positions

   The purpose of this OML is to establish NWS policy on the
   classification of hydrologic positions as "hydrologist" or "hydrologic
   technician" depending on the activities associated with each position.
   It is designed to meet the needs created by the alignment of river
   districts areas along WSFO boundaries and a potential increase in
   hydrologic technician positions at the RFC's.

   Background. The traditional river district program consisted of many
   small areas divided by natural drainage boundaries. The principal
   hydrologic activity was data collection and forecast dissemination. In
   most offices professional user contact was limited to that which could
   be done by the MIC.

   We are now reorganizing the field hydrologic program so that more
   professional work can be accomplished from fewer offices. This is in
   response to needs arising from increasing encroachment on flood plains
   and from the rising importance of wise water resource management. The
   WSFO MIC is responsible for the entire hydrologic program in the
   designated area (usually a state) with staff support by a hydrologist,
   whose professional activities are listed in attachment 1.

   An expanded RFC program also will require a change in staffing patterns
   as hydrologist positions are added for evening and weekend shifts.
   Hydrologic technicians will be assigned many of the tasks shown in
   attachment 1, thus providing an optimal utilization of manpower skills
   as the station workload expands.

   Policy. This policy pertains to dedicated hydrologic positions in which
   the incumbent spends all of his time in hydrologic activities. Most
   WSFO/ WSO meteorologists and meteorological technicians will continue
   to perform hydrologic tasks as necessary, however, such tasks will
   normally require a small percentage of their time. Their positions will
   continue to be classified in accord with their principal duties.

   A position will be classified as "hydrologist" when the incumbent is
   required to perform routinely any of the hydrologist activities listed
   in attachment 1. Other positions will be classified as "hydrologic
   technician." They will be used generally to support a professional
   hydrologist, especially in an RFC where they will rarely work alone.

   Implementation. As stated in a recent policy letter, "the immediate aim
   is to staff each WSFO having river district functions with a
   professional hydrologist." Hydrologic technician positions may be
   required at WSFO's but such positions should be deferred until this
   first goal is met. WSFO's having only a small hydrologic program in
   their area may use a meteorologist as a program leader for hydrologic
   activities.

   The RFC's will continue to be the first echelon offices responsible for
   developing, evaluating and issuing river and flood forecasts for the
   United States. The WSFO hydrologist will be the NWS hydrologic expert
   for the area serviced, so emphasis should be placed on the professional
   aspects of his job.

   Recruitment and Training. It is important that people with appropriate
   background be selected for hydrologic positions. The Hydrologic Career
   Management Program provides for crossover assignments of meteorologists
   to hydrology along with the consideration of outside applicants having
   training and/or experience applicable to the NWS hydrologic program.
   Recruitment for hydrologist positions should consider those recent
   college graduates who have the most credits in courses directly
   applicable to NWS hydrologic activities.

   The Office of Hydrology has a training officer in the Hydrologic
   Services Division. The design of training programs is now underway for
   both RFC and WSFO hydrologists. This will include new courses and
   revision of those courses presently available, which are:

     (1) Hydrologic Services. This is a short NWS correspondence course
     in the methods of performing river district functions.

     (2) Introduction to River Forecasting - University of Oklahoma. This
     is a 3-semester hour correspondence course in the technical aspects
     of river forecasting. It is an excellent course for meteorological
     and hydrologic technicians, and WSFO hydrologists and
     meteorologists.

     (3) U.S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School Correspondence
     Courses. These are two 4.5 quarter hour courses in river forecasting
     and other hydrologic subjects for hydrologists in WSFO's and RFC's.

   The current Hydrologic Analysis and Forecasting Course used for foreign
   nationals as well as NWS hydrologists will be replaced by a shorter
   basic hydrologic course for NWS people. It will continue to be open to
   a few foreign students. More advanced courses will be developed also as
   a part of our continuing education program.

   Hydrologists Grades. As established by the NOAA Merit Promotion Plan,
   the journeyman grade for Hydrologists is GS-ll. Selections for GS-12
   and above will be competitive. RFC's with sufficient personnel have an
   established grade pattern consisting of (1) HIC GS-15, (2) PA GS-14,
   (3) Lead Hydrologists GS-13, (4) General Forecasters GS-12, Newly
   selected hydrologists can frequently serve at a lower grade "in lieu
   of" the GS-12 level. However, when this is done the position should be
   carried on the books as an authorized GS-12 slot. Thus, when it is
   determined that an actual GS-12 hydrologist is required, the position
   is to be filled through the competitive process. If the Incumbent
   serving "in lieu of" the GS-12 slot is not selected, he will be
   reassigned to an appropriate position.

   The bulk of WSFO hydrologists positions will be at the GS-II and GS-12
   level, with only a few at the GS-13 level. Grade levels will be
   determined by diversity and complexity of station hydrologic programs.
   A typical example of a dedicated GS-13 hydrologist would be to lead a
   team of specialists in a comprehensive hydrologic survey of a large
   basin or several small basins within a statewide area; describe the
   hydrologic system in its entirety; determine the quantity distribution
   and availability of water resources; develop technical procedures
   required to provide for an adequate warning system for the area under
   survey, and work with the cognizant RFC as the RFC develops forecast
   procedures for the area concerned. The dedicated GS-13 hydrologist
   should be involved in projects or programs which would be of a
   continuing nature and have major ramifications upon the area serviced.
   He would be the expert on all hydrologic matters that affect his area.
   He would be asked to review, and evaluate and advise on the technical
   adequacy of major hydrologic programs within his area. He would have
   the capability to resolve and finalize problems of conflicting
   interests and would be called upon as an authoritative source of
   consultation by other scientists inside and outside the agency.

   To equate to the GS-12 level, the WSFO Hydrologist would be responsible
   for participating with the cognizant RFC in developing, revising and
   updating flash flood procedures for a variety of rivers. If the current
   forecasts prepared by the RFC do not adequately reflect what is needed,
   the GS-12 hydrologist should respond to this situation with recommended
   procedures and techniques to clarify the situation. The GS-12
   hydrologist also should interact between his office and local, state or
   Federal agencies to resolve or define mutual problems. The incumbent
   should be aware of man-made or natural changes that would affect his
   area and to explore, plan and establish comprehensive studies to
   ascertain these ramifications. The incumbent would have to possess and
   be able to apply an advanced level of professional competence and
   exercise considerable initiative and resourcefulness.

   At the GS-II level, the incumbent could serve as a member of a
   scientific task force designed to survey a river and/or river basin. He
   would be called upon to assist in the definition of complex forecast
   problems which would be forwarded to the cognizant RFC for the actual
   development of river procedures. Based on his professional expertise,
   he would be asked to examine data and determine its validity and
   usability. He would be called upon to develop a hydrologic data
   collection network and turn the functioning network over the nearest
   WS0 for monitoring, maintenance and collection data.

   Hydrologic Technician Grades. Interpretation of the GS 1316 CSC
   standards indicates the highest level for these positions is GS-ll.
   This would be appropriate at a WSF0 without a hydrologist, where a
   technician has been performing necessary hydrologic duties on his own
   for a number of years. When vacated, the Position should be reallocated
   to a hydrologist.

   Most of these positions will be graded at GS-9 or 10, at WSF0's which
   have a hydrologist, depending on the level of responsibility and the
   nature of the assignment. The work situation of the GS-10 would be such
   that the technician would have numerous contacts with other agencies
   and public users. He would have the authority to issue flood warnings
   during the absence of a WSF0 hydrologist. but under RFC guidance.

   Those technicians with less responsibility should be GS-9's. In those
   cases where duties are nearly always limited to the collection,
   processing and forwarding of hydrologic data the position would be
   OS-8.

   Virtually all hydrologic technicians working -in an RFC operate at
   Level III, as described in the standards, since they are always
   supervised by a hydrologist. Therefore, such positions should nearly
   always be GS-7 or 8, depending on whether the responsibility factor
   rates as B or C. Those positions presently graded higher will be
   revised downward only as attrition provides the opportunity for such
   action. This policy creates a career ladder in which RFC technicians
   will have to move to a WSF0 for promotion beyond GS-8.

   Subject: Meteorologist and Meteorological Technician Positions

   REFERENCE:      National Weather Service Intern Plan, March 13, 1974

   CANCELS:    OML 69-2, dated January 17, 1969, filed with I-50

   The purpose of this OML is to update and clarify OML 69-2 by deleting
   the parts of OML 69-2 now contained in the NWS Intern Plan.


   Policy. A position will be classified "meteorologist" when it requires
   the incumbent to carry out one or more meteorologist-level activities.
   Otherwise, it will be classified "meteorological technician."
   Meteorologist-level activities require a knowledge and understanding of
   meteorological theory, and the application of this theory and other
   physical laws and relationships in the solution of day-to-day
   operational problems. In consideration of this principle, meteorologist
   and meteorological technician activities will be classified as
   indicated in Attachment I.

   Attention is called to the significance of activity type 7 Normally the
   station supervisor must supervise activities 1 and/or 4 to qualify for
   a meteorologist-in-charge rating. However, he could qualify in the
   absence of these activities where community representation at a
   sufficiently high level is required and cannot be provided by a
   meteorologist-in-charge of a nearby station.

   Meteorologists must be mobile, particularly during their first few
   years in the National Weather Service. Attachment II is the mobility
   statement to be signed by meteorologist interns prior to their
   employment.


   Training Activities. Many meteorological technicians have been taking
   advantage of opportunities to acquire the academic background necessary
   to qualify for entrance into the meteorologist intern program. These
   efforts are appreciated and encouraged. Apart from qualifying for a
   meteorologist rating, training is still highly beneficial to the
   individual and the organization. The work performed at all National
   Weather Service stations is highly technical. It requires specialized
   knowledge and skills, and the exercise of good judgment and above-the
   ordinary presence of mind in making decisions and dealing with the
   public. Assignments as officials-in-charge are more than routine work.
   Considerable training and experience, as well as certain personal
   qualities are required to perform satisfactorily. The NWS will continue
   to Day tuition for career-related courses, both in-residence and
   correspondence.


   Educational Requirements. The educational requirements for
   meteorologist status are as stated in CSC Handbook X118. They are:

     Basic Requirements for all Grades:

   Candidates must show successful completion of A, B, or C below:

   A. A full course of study leading to a bachelor's degree in an
   accredited college or university which has included or been
   supplemented by 20 semester hours in meteorology including 6 semester
   hours in weather analysis and forecasting, and 6 semester hours in
   dynamic meteorology; and, in addition, differential and integral
   calculus and 6 semester hours in college Physics.

   B. At least 20 semester hours in meteorology at an accredited college
   or university which has included 6 semester hours in weather analysis
   and forecasting, and 6 semester hours in dynamic meteorology; and, in
   addition, differential and integral calculus and 6 semester hours in
   college physics; plus additional appropriate education or technical
   experience which when combined with the education prescribed above will
   total 4 years of education or education and experience. This
   preprofessional background must be of such quality that it provides a
   body of knowledge and abilities comparable to that normally acquired
   through the successful completion of the full course of study described
   in paragraph A above.

   C. Candidates who are enrolled or are accepted for enrollment in a
   graduate curriculum leading to a master's degree in meteorology and who
   have successfully completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree in
   physics, mathematics, engineering, or related physical or earth
   sciences, may be rated eligible at GS-5 only.

   Candidates for meteorological research positions must have successfully
   completed the college curriculum, including the required course work in
   meteorology, physics and mathematics, specified in paragraph A of the
   Basic Requirements for all Grades.
