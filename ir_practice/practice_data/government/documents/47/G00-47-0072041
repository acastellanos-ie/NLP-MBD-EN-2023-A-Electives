   AvSP Sponsors Risk Analysis Workshop

      Langley Research Centers Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) recently
      hosted the third annual Risk Analysis and Safety Performance
      Measurements in Aviation Workshop in downtown Hampton.

      The three-day seminar, which was co-sponsored by the Federal Aviation
      Administrations (FAA) Airport and Aircraft Safety R&D Division and
      Office of System Safety, drew 150 participants, some from as far away
      as New Zealand. It offered government organizations, airlines and air
      operators a forum to share their philosophies, approaches, models and
      methodologies for assessing risk and judging safety performance.

      This is the one chance each year for all us working in aviation safety
      to come together, said Langleys Vince Schultz, the AvSPs technical
      integration manager. We get to exchange experiences, lessons learned
      and hear about current issues facing the community.

      Three dozen speakers and panelists from NASA, the FAA, airlines,
      aviation organizations and universities spoke about their groups
      efforts to improve aviation safety and the gathering of safety
      information. (Accurate data and its comprehensive analysis are key
      aspects in the AvSPs attempt to reduce the fatal aircraft accident
      rate by 80 percent in 10 years.)

      John Goglia, a U.S. National Transportation Safety Board member who has
      helped investigate a number of transportation accidents, was the
      events keynote speaker.

      This whole data collection, risk management change in culture is the
      future, Goglia said. This will drive down the accident rate if we can
      get a handle on it.
