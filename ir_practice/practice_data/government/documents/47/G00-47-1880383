   Energy Policy Statutes and Rules

      Primary statutory guidance for activities of the Energy Policy Group
      comes from RCW 43.21F.015:

        It is the policy of the state of Washington that:

        (1) The development and use of a diverse array of energy resources
        with emphasis on renewable energy resources shall be encouraged;

        (2) The supply of energy shall be sufficient to insure the health
        and economic welfare of its citizens;

        (3) The development and use of energy resources shall be consistent
        with the statutory environmental policies of the state;

        (4) Energy conservation and elimination of wasteful and uneconomic
        uses of energy and materials shall be encouraged, and this
        conservation should include, but is not limited to, resource
        recovery and materials recycling;

        (5) In energy emergency shortage situations, energy requirements to
        maintain the public health, safety, and welfare shall be given
        priority in the allocation of energy resources, and citizens and
        industry shall be assisted in adjusting to the limited availability
        of energy in order to minimize adverse impacts on their physical,
        social, and economic well being;

        (6) State government shall provide a source of impartial and
        objective information in order that this energy policy may be
        enhanced; and

        (7) The state energy strategy shall provide primary guidance for
        implementation of the state's energy policy.
