          Hansen Praises House for Supporting Exploration in ANWR -
              a Vote for American Jobs & Americas Energy Future
     Bipartisan support underscores the gentle impact of new technology

   Washington, D.C. House Resources Chairman James V. Hansen today praised
   House colleagues for their bipartisan support of environmentally-gentle
   energy development impacting 2,000 acres of the Arctic National
   Wildlife Refuge. The House late Wednesday voted down an amendment to
   strike the ANWR provision from the SAFE Act 2001. Hansens committee
   crafted the provision.

   Chairman Hansen's statement:
   "The House made the right decision tonight on a tough issue. Rarely
       have I seen a provision demagogued so ferociously. Men and women on
       both sides of the aisle saw past the passion and the rhetoric to
       the facts, the science and the common sense of the proposal. I
       applaud my colleagues judgment and courage. They made the right
       choice for American consumers, American workers, Americas economy
       and Americas energy future."
