   Welcome to the Office of the National Marine Sanctuaries' web site.
   Here you'll find information about our nation's marine sanctuaries --
   their history and current management and their scientific and
   educational programs. A national calendar will keep you updated on the
   many exciting events that take place in them throughout the year.

   Within our 13 sites, you'll discover a vast range of marine creatures,
   habitats, historical artifacts, and flourishing maritime cultures. In
   one site you'll find the breeding and calving grounds of giant humpback
   whales, in another the remains of an 18th century shipwreck, and in yet
   another thriving coral reef colonies or kelp forests.

   We'll continue to update these pages and hope you'll return often to
   learn more about the living marine resources we all share. We
   appreciate your comments and suggestions.
