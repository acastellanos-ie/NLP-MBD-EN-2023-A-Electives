     Planning a diving or snorkeling trip is no easy task. Divers need to
     consider the environment they are diving as well as their own
     personal safety before submerging into the water. The National
     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has many resources
     available for recreational divers to help make trip planning easier
     and more enjoyable. This Web site provides direct links to specific
     NOAA services and products that divers should use in planning
     memorable dives.

     Whether you are tying to find out tomorrows weather forecast, local
     navigation charts, or tips on how to be an environmentally
     responsible diver, remember that NOAA is here to help. Think of NOAA
     as your dive planning partner and take advantage of the information
     that is provided here!
