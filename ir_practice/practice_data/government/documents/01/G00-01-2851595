   CWS/CMS Project Office: Executive Profile

   CWS/CMS is a result of Chapter 1294, Statutes of 1989, Senate Bill 370.
   SB 370 required the development of a statewide computer system to
   automate the functions of county child welfare offices. The CWS/CMS
   system automates many of the tasks that county workers had to perform
   routinely and often manually. CWS/CMS allows for a centralized
   statewide system that allows State or county child welfare workers to
   share information on child abuse cases.

   County conversion to CWS/CMS began in January, 1997. On December 31,
   1997, all 58 counties were online and accessing CWS/CMS.

                              Vision Statement

   The CWS/CMS is a statewide tool that supports an effective Child
   Welfare System of services. The CWS/CMS improves the lives of children
   and families by giving service workers information to improve case work
   services and freeing them from repetitive tasks; provides policy makers
   with information to design and manage services; and fulfill State and
   Federal legislative intent.
