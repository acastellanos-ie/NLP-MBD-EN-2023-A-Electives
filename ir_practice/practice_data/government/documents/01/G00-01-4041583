   The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board is an independent federal
   agency established by Congress in 1988. The Board's mandate under the
   Atomic Energy Act is to provide safety oversight of the nuclear weapons
   complex operated by the Department of Energy (DOE). The nuclear weapons
   program remains a complex and hazardous operation. DOE must maintain
   readiness of the nuclear arsenal, dismantle surplus weapons, dispose of
   excess radioactive materials, clean up surplus facilities, and
   construct new facilities for many purposes. The Board's mission is to
   ensure that the DOE carries out all these tasks in a manner that
   protects the public, workers, and the environment.
