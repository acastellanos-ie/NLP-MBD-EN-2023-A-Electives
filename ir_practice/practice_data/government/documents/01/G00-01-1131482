         National Genetic Resources Program

         NGRP Navigation Bar
         Welcome!

         In 1990, the U.S. Congress authorized establishment of a National
         Genetic Resources Program (NGRP). It is the NGRP's responsibility to:
         acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to
         scientists, germplasm of all lifeforms important for food and
         agricultural production.
         The Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) web server provides
         germplasm information about plants, animals, microbes and
         invertebrates. This program is within the U.S. Department of
         Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.
         The National Genetic Resources Advisory Council (NGRAC) advises and
         makes recommendations to the Secretary and Director of the NGRP. The
         NGRAC responds to the important issues of the nation in respect to
         conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and agriculture. To
         view information on NGRAC, the minutes of its meetings, and
         recommendations from NGRAC, go to the NGRAC Home Page.
