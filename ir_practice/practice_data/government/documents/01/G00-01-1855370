   . . Our Mission

   The fundamental mission of the Federal Aviation Administration is to
   foster a safe and efficient National Air Transportation System. Our air
   transportation system has over 17,000 landing facilities, 226,000
   registered aircraft, 700,000 pilots, 8000 tower controllers, a
   multitude of terminal buildings and access roads, and 500 million
   passenger enplanements each year. In this massive system, there are
   many opportunities for human errors that can lead to accidents and
   incidents.
   Our goal is to accommodate the projected traffic growth and establish
   an operational environment that is free of accidents and fatalities. We
   will achieve this goal by continuously improving the system and
   maximizing the use of existing facilities by developing new standards,
   criteria, and guidelines to plan, design, construct, operate and
   maintain the Nation's airports and heliports.
