                         APPLY TO BE COURT MEDIATOR

   The Mediation training sessions scheduled for January, February and
   March of 2002 have been postponed until later this year. We will post
   the rescheduled dates of these sessions at least two months in advance.
   In the meantime, the ADR Program will continue to accept and review new
   applications from potential mediators. We do not have any ENE or
   Arbitration trainings scheduled at this time, but you may submit an
   application for consideration for future trainings. Click here for more
