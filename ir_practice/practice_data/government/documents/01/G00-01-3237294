   Riparian habitat along the Sacramento River is a diverse mosaic of
   habitat ranging from broad gravel bars to shady sloughs, from gallery
   forests to emergent cottonwoods at the water's edge.  The riparian
   corridor of the Sacramento River has some of the best agricultural soil
   and most productive orchards in the state.

   The Sacramento River Riparian Habitat Program is working to ensure that
   riparian habitat management along the river addresses the dynamics of
   the riparian ecosystem and the reality of the local agricultural
   economy.  Its goals are to preserve remaining riparian habitat, and to
   reestablish a continuous riparian ecosystem along the river.
