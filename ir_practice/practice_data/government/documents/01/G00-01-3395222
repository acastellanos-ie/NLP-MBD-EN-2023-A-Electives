   Welcome to the NASA JSC Digital Image Collection. Each Shuttle mission
   produces 2000 to 5000 photographic images. Over 250,000 images have
   been captured, digitized, and stored. Learn more about this collection
   and the JSC digital imaging project. NASA generally does not assert
   copyright, however learn more about conditions for use of images. Now
   full text search capabilities are implemented. A graphical browser for
   all cataloged Shuttle Earth Observation images is also available.
   (NOTE: Digital images are not available for all images referenced by
   the graphical browser.) The NASA Photo Gallery is an attempt to bring
   all of NASA's still images to one location.

   A list of frequently asked questions is now available.
