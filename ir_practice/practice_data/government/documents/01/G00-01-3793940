   Welcome to the CWC Homepage! This site provides information to help the
   United States comply with reporting and inspection requirements of the
   Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), a global treaty that bans chemical
   weapons. The CWC is the first arms control and nonproliferation treaty
   to widely affect the private sector. Although the United States does
   not manufacture chemical weapons, it does produce, process, consume,
   import and export a number of dual-use chemicals that can be used to
   produce chemical weapons. United States companies engaged in activities
   involving certain chemicals may be required to submit reports to the
   Department of Commerce and may be subject to inspection by the
   Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the
   international body that administers the treaty in The Hague,
   Netherlands. The purpose of this site is to inform U.S. industry of its
   rights and obligations under BXA's CWC regulations. The objectives of
   the Department of Commerce in implementing the Convention are to
   demonstrate industry compliance with the treaty while maximizing the
   protection of confidential business information and minimizing the
   burdens and costs to U.S. companies.
