     The Center for X-Ray Optics (CXRO) was established in 1984 at the
     Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). It has complementary
     roles: demonstrating the scientific capabilities and usefulness of
     the x-ray and extreme ultraviolet regions of the spectrum and
     developing equipment and techniques which make those capabilities
     widely and readily available. These techniques and equipment include
     state-of-the-art x-ray lenses and mirrors, monochromators optimized
     for high resolution and throughput, and optical systems for the
     utilization of partially coherent radiation for applications across
     the physical and life sciences. Some of the topics of current
     pursuit are listed below.
