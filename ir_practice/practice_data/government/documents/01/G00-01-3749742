                               Research at the

              Virtual National Laboratory for Heavy-Ion Fusion

   The Virtual National Laboratory for Heavy-Ion Fusion (HIF-VNL) was
   established in 1999 to develop heavy-ion accelerators capable of
   igniting inertial-fusion targets for electric-power production.  The
   collaboration, which presently involves Lawrence Berkeley National
   Laboratory (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and
   Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, is funded through the Office of
   Fusion Energy at the US Department of Energy.  According the memorandum
   creating the partnership, the HIF-VNL is chartered with "promoting more
   rapid progress in the development of heavy ion drivers through
   technical management integration of the laboratories scientific staff,
   equipment, and experimental facilities."  The current focus of HIF-VNL
   research is the design of an Integrated Research Experiment (IRE), a
   multiple-beam induction accelerator that would address, at a smaller
   scale, many of the critical technological and physics issues of a
   inertial-fusion driver.  Induction accelerators are used for several
   reasons.  They can handle much higher currents than the radio-frequency
   (rf) accelerators used for high-energy physics, and they allow a beam
   to be beam to be compressed during acceleration, eliminating the need
   for storage rings.  Also, induction accelerators have a lower-cost
   development path than rf accelerators because the critical physics
   questions occur a low energies, allowing them to be studied on
   small-scale experiments.  Initial studies have shown that this approach
   should have significant cost advantages over designs based on rf
   accelerators.

   The IRE is intended as an integrated experiment to test simultaneously
   all aspects of a driver-scale accelerator, the injecting, transport
   through electrostatic and magnetic quadrupole lattices, final focusing,
   and transport through a reactor chamber.  Together with the
   target-physics database from laser-based  National Ignition Facility,
   the IRE should provide the scientific and technological basis for an
   Engineering Test Facility, the final step toward an inertial-fusion
   demonstration power plant.  To a large extent, this goal determines the
   scale of the experiment.  A hundred or more lattice periods are needed
   to demonstrate an understanding of beam dynamics in a transport
   lattice.  In order for beam loading to resemble that in a driver, the
   total current at the end of the IRE must be about 100 A, and tens of
   parallel beamlets are needed to carry this amount of current.  To allow
   useful focusing experiments, the ion energy must be 100 MeV or greater,
   the final perveance must be in the range 10^-5 to 10^-4, and the
   normalize emittance must be less than about 15 mm-mrad.  Finally, to
   validate beam-target interaction physics, the target temperature must
   reach about 50 eV, requiring a flux of 3 x 10^12 W/cm and a total beam
   energy exceeding 1 kJ.   The precise accelerator requirements will, of
   course, emerge as design work proceeds.

   A wide range of HIF-VNL research is currently underway to develop the
   physics and technological understanding needed to design the IRE.  This
   research falls into three general categories.

                physics of an IRE.  These experiments include the
                High-Current Transport Experiment (HCX) and
                Multiple-Beamlet Injector Experiment, both currently being
                planned, as well as recent projects like the Scaled
                Final-Focus Experiment, the  Beam-Combiner Experiment, and
                the  Plasma-Lens Experiments.

                numerical models, ranging from zero-dimensional systems
                codes to 3-D particle-in-cell simulations.  The numerical
                tools are able to model all parts of an accelerator from
                source to target at an appropriate level of detail, and
                they are used now both to design the IRE and supporting
                experiments and to help understand experimental results.
                In the accelerator, the areas presently being studied
                include beam matching, emittance growth, lattice-error
                tolerances, beam-halo formation, and bunch compression.
                Beam transport in the reactor chamber is also being
                examined to determine the best ways to neutralize the beam
                and to minimize the focal spot.

                Engineering research and development work to develop the
                innovative approaches to fabricating affordable and
                reliable accelerator components.  The evaluation of
                low-cost magnetic-core materials and the design of
                superconducting magnetic-quadrupole arrays are active
                areas of IRE reasearch.

   Work in these areas is co-ordinated through frequent teleconferences
          involving the HIV-VNL partners and through frequent internal
          reviews.  It is expected that conceptual-design work on the IRE
          will begin early in 2002.
