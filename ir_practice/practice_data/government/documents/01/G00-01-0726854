   Our Mission
   graphic

           Welcome to the Office of Safety and Security Home Page.  The
     Federal Transit Administration's Office of Safety and Security is
     concerned with matters relating to the safety and security of our
     nation's mass transit systems.

       graphic

         Everyone in the Office of Safety and Security would like to
   express their deepest sympathy to all who were affected by the
   September 11 attacks on our country.
         In order to help transit agencies cope with an uncertain future,
   additional security demands, and possible aftermath, the Federal
   Transit Administration is offering security awareness and training
   across the country, as well as a Safety and Security Tool Kit. These,
   and other important topics are outlined in a Dear Colleague letter
   recently issued by FTA Administrator Jennifer L. Dorn.
