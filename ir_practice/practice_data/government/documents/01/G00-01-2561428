   The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC), established in 1997, is a
   multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and
   analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the
   NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in
   several efforts related to the Human Genome Project. These include a
   Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the Mammalian Gene
   Collection Program, and the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project.
