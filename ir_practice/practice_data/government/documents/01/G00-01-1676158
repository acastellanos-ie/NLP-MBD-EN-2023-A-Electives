            A message from Betsy Gotbaum, our New Public Advocate

      [bg_portrait.jpg] It is both exciting and daunting to begin a new
   administration in these challenging days for our great city. Now is the
   time that elected officials must live up to promises made to the public
                         during election campaigns.

   During my campaign, I promised that as Public Advocate I would be your
    watchdog over city government. This pledge remains very important to
   me. I look forward to working with the new Mayor to make our government
                     more efficient and more responsive.

      I also often spoke during the campaign about bringing the Public
     Advocate's office closer to people. As ombudswoman for the city, I
    promise to be in the boroughs, listening to people and learning about
                          problems with government.

    My goal is to demonstrate to New Yorkers that my office can help-that
        they were right to put their trust in me, and that the Public
            Advocate's office can help make all our lives better.

                                Betsy Gotbaum

     In June 1994, Betsy Gotbaum was appointed Executive Director of the
   New-York Historical Society.  In 1998 she became the Societys President
   and member of the Board of Trustees. The Historical Society is New York
    Citys oldest museum, and contains one of the countrys most extensive
       research libraries.  Under Ms. Gotbaums leadership, the Society
   reopened its landmark building on Central Park West in May 1995, after
                        a major capital restoration.

     Before assuming her position at the Historical Society, Ms. Gotbaum
   served as New York City Commissioner of Parks & Recreation from 1990 to
    1994.  She ran programs and special events that attracted millions of
    New Yorkers of all ages to the parks.  She was responsible for 26,000
     acres of parkland, and an annual budget of more than $150 million.

    Ms. Gotbaum grew up in New York City, where she attended Brearley and
    Barnard.  She received her B.A. from George Washington University in
   1961 and earned a Masters Degree in Education at Columbia University in
   1968.  Throughout her career, Ms. Gotbaum has served in city government
      and worked for not-for-profit organizations.  She was Mayor John
   Lindsays Assistant for Education, and was Executive Director of The New
                        York City Police Foundation.

   Ms. Gotbaum is on the Board of the Community Service Society, Municipal
    Art Society, Goodwill Industries and The Valley Recreation and Youth
