     WHO WE ARE

     The Washington Legislature created the Washington State Institute for
     Public Policy in 1983. A Board of Directorsrepresenting the
     legislature, the governor, and public universitiesgoverns the Institute
     and guides the development of all activities.

     WHAT WE DO

     The Institutes mission is to carry out practical, non-partisan
     researchat legislative directionon issues of importance to Washington
     State. The Institute conducts research activities using its own policy
     analysts and economists, specialists from universities, and
     consultants. Institute staff work closely with legislators, legislative
     and state agency staff, and experts in the field to ensure that studies
     answer relevant policy questions. Fiscal and administrative services
     for the Institute are provided by The Evergreen State College.

     RESEARCH FOCUS

     Current areas of staff expertise include:  education, criminal justice,
     welfare, children and adult services, health, utilities, and general
     government.  The Institute also collaborates with academic faculty in
     public and private universities and contracts with other experts to
     extend our capacity for studies on diverse topics.  For several
     projects, we have successfully merged administrative data from two or
     more agencies, significantly reducing the cost of outcome research.
