                    Security of Nuclear Power Plants in the United States.

    Although U.S. nuclear power plants are not specifically designed to be
             impervious to impact by a modern commercial jet airliner, the
    containment buildings at U. S. nuclear power plants are among the most
                    massively constructed structures ever built ... (more)

  Introduction

   The International Nuclear Safety Center (INSC), which operates under
   the guidance of the Director of International Nuclear Safety and
   Cooperation (NN-30) in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), has the
   mission of improving nuclear power reactor safety worldwide. The INSC
   is dedicated to the goals of developing enhanced nuclear safety
   technology and promoting the open exchange of nuclear safety
   information among nations. The INSC sponsors scientific research
   activities as collaborations between the U.S. and its international
   partners, who have also established safety centers in their countries.
   INSC activities are currently focused on Soviet-designed nuclear power
   plants in Russia and Eastern Europe.

  The INSC Database

   The INSC Database provides an interactively-accessible information
   resource and communications medium for researchers and scientists
   engaged in projects sponsored by the INSC. Major portions of the INSC
   Database are devoted to nuclear plant-specific information, material
   properties for safety and risk analyses, INSC project documentation,
   and project-specific reactor safety bibliographies. Much of the INSC
   Database is open to the public. Project information that is preliminary
   or proprietary to INSC research partners is reserved from publication,
   but made available to INSC project participants with access controlled
   by user identity and access level authorization. Preliminary
   information may eventually become available following the normal
   scientific review process.

   Major branches in the INSC Database structure may be reached from the
   following links:

   o Reactor and Plant Information           o Reactor Material Properties
   o INSC Projects and Current Activities    o INSC Safety and Risk Analysis
                                               Library
   o Other Information Sources and Databases o Audio-Visual Materials

  INSC Database Implementation

   The INSC Database has been implemented by the Reactor Analysis and
   Engineering Division at Argonne National Laboratory. Information
   cataloging and database maintenance is performed with automated
   database management systems. The database and its content are verified
   and maintained in compliance with applicable quality assurance
   standards and practices. No warranties or guarantees are made regarding
   the content of this database, and no liabilites are assumed. Regarding
   the use of this web site, please read the DOE security notice.
