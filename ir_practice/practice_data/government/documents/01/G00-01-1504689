   Welcome to The Virtual Library of Energy Science and Technology hosted
   by the Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical
   Information.

     New - Energy Citations Database provides Web access to DOE's
     scientific and technical information from 1948 forward.

   The Library includes three vast virtual resources covering each of the
   three main ways by which scientists communicate their findings: journal
   literature, gray literature, and preprints. Many other resources of
   interest are available, including the new DOE R&D Portfolio Web site,
   which describes the scope of DOE R&D Programs.

   Peer-reviewed journal literature is presented by PubSCIENCE which has 2
   million searchable bibliographic records, many with hyperlinks to
   full-text in over 1000 journals issued by over 50 major publishers.

   Gray literature, which includes technical reports produced by
   Department of Energy National Laboratories and grantees, is presented
   in the DOE Information Bridge. It has over 60,000 searchable reports
   comprising millions of pages.

   Over 7,600 preprint servers from all around the world host preprints,
   the newest way by which scientists communicate their findings. The
   PrePRINT Network links to all these preprint servers, with an estimated
   400,000 eprints, and makes them accessible via a variety of indexing
   techniques. Especially innovative is the distributed search feature of
   the PrePRINT Network which allows patrons to launch parallel searches
   on any or all of the preprint servers that have their own search
   engines.  PrePRINT Alerts, the newest feature added to this product,
   allows users to automatically receive the most current preprints from
   28 databases. Individuals simply set up a personalized profile, and the
   newest preprint information will be delivered to their desktops via
   email on a weekly basis.

   Other resources include:

   - DOE R&D Accomplishments - describes past DOE research and development
   projects that have had significant economic impact, have improved
   people's lives, or have been widely recognized as a remarkable advance
   in science.

   - DOE R&D Project Summaries - describes approximately 22,000 research
   and development projects underway at the Department of Energy.

   The Virtual Library of Energy Science and Technology presents many more
   DOE information resources, and many information products produced by
   other government Agencies, numbering almost 500 in all. See the entire
   set at EnergyFiles: Virtual Library of Energy Science and Technology,
   and try out the distributed search feature EnergyPortal Search.

   Most recently, OSTI added two new products to its portfolio.  The
   GrayLIT Network provides a comprehensive portal to over 119,000
   full-text technical reports from various Federal agencies.  Federal
   Research and Development Project Summaries provides Federal R&D
   information from over 370,000 project summaries.  With a single query,
   users may search individual databases residing at different agencies.
   Both products are early successes stemming from the  Workshop Report on
   a Future Information Infrastructure for the Physical Sciences.

   Our goal is a fully searchable dynamic information resource that
   provides organized access to a comprehensive resource of scientific and
   technical information in physics and other disciplines of concern to
   the Department of Energy.
