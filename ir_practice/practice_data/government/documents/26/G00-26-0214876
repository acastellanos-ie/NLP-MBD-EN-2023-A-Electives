  Implications for Improving Planning and Operations in Traffic Management

   DATE: Sunday, January 13, 2002, 1:30 PM – 5:30 PM
   LOCATION:Hilton Washington Hotel, Georgetown East
   COST:Free (Please complete and submit attached registration form)

   This workshop will help transportation decision-makers to plan for the
   lifecycle costs of an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
   project.  The workshop has five goals: 1) Assess recent planning and
   deployment experiences (what worked and did not work) from several
   state and local transportation agencies; 2) Explore budgeting for
   capital costs and beyond, costs of operations and maintenance, costs of
   managing ITS, and alternatives for operating and maintaining an ITS
   project; 3) Explore needed organizational changes and public policy
   shifts; 4) Review lifecycle costing tools such as the FHWA sponsored
   ITS Unit Costs Database (http://www.benefitcost.its.dot.gov); and, 5)
   Receive first-hand lessons (both positive and negative) learned from
   projects.

   The workshop will provide excellent networking opportunities among
   private and public sector representatives and will promote interactive
   dialogue among speakers/audience on lifecycle costs.  Participants are
   encouraged to propose and discuss transportation planning for the
   future using the ITS Unit Costs Database as a lifecycle costing tool.

   RECOMMENDED AUDIENCE: ITS planners and operators at the state and local
   levels, as well as federal planners and contractors/consultants with an
   interest in understanding and contributing to the dialogue of lifecycle
   costs in ITS projects.

   SPONSORS: Three TRB Committees: ITS, Transportation Economics, and
   Taxation and Finance; ITS America Benefits, Evaluation, and Costs (BEC)
   Committee; and the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC).
