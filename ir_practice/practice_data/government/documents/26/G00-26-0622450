                                   History

   Enrico Fermi Atoms for peace was Argonne's post-war mission. That role
   expanded considerably in 1947 when the Atomic Energy Commission called
   upon Argonne's expertise to develop reactors for America's nascent
   nuclear energy program.

   Starting in 1951 with the first electricity powered by atomic energy,
   Argonne has led the research that supports every main nuclear power
   system throughout the world. Every reactor type that has subsequently
   proven to be successful for the production of electrical energy around
   the world was either invented or developed at Argonne.

   Argonne's contribution to the history of nuclear power starts with
   Fermi's CP-1 (Chicago Pile 1), the development of light water reactors
   and other reactor types.
