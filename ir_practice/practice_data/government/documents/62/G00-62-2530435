                         FSW Branch Technology Initiatives

      FSW Branch Technology Initiatives includes activities, typically funded
      separate from flight project activities, which are specifically
      intended to increase the functionality of FSW, improve the FSW
      development process, demonstrate a new FSW concept or demonstrate an
      end-to-end mission operations concept in conjunction with other
      organizations.

      In addition, most FSW development activities include technology
      initiatives within the framework of the mission implementation.
