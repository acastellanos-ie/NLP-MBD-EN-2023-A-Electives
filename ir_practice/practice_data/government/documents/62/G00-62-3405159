             New York State Library - A Library for New Yorkers

   The New York State Library is part of the Office of Cultural Education,
   within the New York State Education Department. Since its establishment
   in 1818 the State Library has been a repository for the official
   publications of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches,
   commissions, public authorities, and other agencies of the State
   government.

   The Library has three major components:
     * The Research Library: The Research Library's collections, which
       include over 20 million items, support State government work and
       the research needs of the general public, both on-site and via
       interlibrary loan.
     * The Talking Book and Braille Library (TBBL): TBBL lends braille and
       recorded books and magazines, and related equipment to residents of
       the 55 upstate counties of New York State who are unable to read
       printed materials because of a visual or physical disability.
     * Division of Library Development: Library Development works in
       partnership with 74 library systems to bring library services to
       the millions of people who use New Yorks academic, public, school
       and special libraries. Library Development also administers State
       and Federal grant programs that provide aid for library services
       and programs.
