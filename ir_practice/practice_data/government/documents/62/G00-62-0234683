                              RIFA Program Goal


   The overall goal of the Red Imported Fire Ant (RIFA) program is to
   provide an intensive, coordinated state and community-wide program with
   a high probability of containing the spread, controlling and/or
   eradicating the current population, and detecting RIFA as it exists
   elsewhere in California.
