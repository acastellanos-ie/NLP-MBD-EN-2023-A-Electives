  Introduction to the INSC Material Properties Database

   Material properties that are to be included in the database are
   intended to meet the needs of analysts using computer codes and doing
   experiments for safety evaluation of the world's commercial nuclear
   reactors. The focus is on the materials used in light water reactors
   (LWRs) with initial emphasis on high-priority properties of materials
   unique to Soviet nuclear reactor designs and reactors in eastern-Europe
   and developing countries. A list of properties for each material and
   the phases to be considered are determined based on a needs assessment.
   The longer-term goal is to include data that will meet future needs
   such as materials used in evolutionary reactor designs, properties of
   extended burnup fuel, and possibly properties of mixed oxide fuels.

  Material Type Categories

   In accord with a proposed database by the IAEA, the properties are
   organized according to material type in the following categories:
     * Fuel
     * Cladding
     * Absorber materials
     * Structural materials
     * Coolants
     * Concretes
     * Mixtures relevant to last stages of severe accidents

  Material Property Categories

   The database user may select one of these categories to obtain a list
   of materials for which there are properties. The categories for the
   properties to be assessed are:
     * Thermodynamic properties
     * Transport properties
     * Mechanical properties

   Although some properties such as density and thermal expansion are
   required for all materials, some properties are relevant for only
   certain materials.

  Global Documents

   In addition to the above categories, some global documents concerning
   more than one specific property or material are available. They are
   usually accessed by following links from the other material properties
   documents.
     * Relationship between materials properties

   This link provides access to information on the THERSYST Database for
   Thermophysical Properties. The experimental data that are analyzed in
   the assessments in the INSC Material Properties Database are stored in
   the THERSYST Database. Information regarding how these data may be
   obtained from the THERSYST Database is given at this site.

   Please follow this link to additional databases of material properties
   available on the world wide web.
