                         Tank Waste Systems Program

     This site is used primarily when the project needs to have
     designated reviewers at remote locations conduct reviews of
     technical documents.

   There are 177 underground waste storage tanks at Hanford. The tanks
   contain wastes collected over almost 50 years of plutonium production.
   The wastes include radioactive isotopes, toxic chemicals, corrosive
   liquids, organic solvents, and other dangerous and hazardous
   substances. The Fluor Daniel Hanford Company has the task of cleaning
   up these tanks One of the many challenges is maintaining the safety of
   the workers and the surrounding environment during clean up. In support
   of Fluor Daniel Hanford, as part of the Tank Waste Safety Program, PNNL
   researchers are examining the tanks and developing methods and
   equipment to ensure safety during clean up. The Tank Waste Safety
   Program comprises projects that are aligned with Hanford tank safety
   issues. In FY 1999, the funded project is to contribute to the
   resolution of the flammable gas safety issue and in particular, aid in
   the mitigation and remediation of the SY-101 Surface Level Rise.

   Several organizations across the country are working together to
   address various aspects of the Tank Waste Safety program at Hanford.
   The knowledge gained from this collaborative action can be applied to
   similar tank waste problems at other locations.

   The Tank Waste Safety program at PNNL supports the Characterization
   product line, an integrated suite of services that finds solutions to
   today's complex environmental problems requiring an understanding of
   materials such as hazardous or radioactive waste, and how these
   constituents interact with soils, groundwaters, and biological samples.

   The Tank Waste Remediation System is a multi-contractor effort to clean
   up the underground waste storage tanks at Hanford. The Tank Waste
   Saftey program provides support to TWRS.

Capabilities

   PNNL forms teams that cut across organizational lines, providing a
   custom mix of expertise to solve problems. The capabilities most often
   called on to resolve tank waste safety problems are
     * Process Science and Engineering
     * Material Science and Engineering
     * Physics and Chemistry Modeling
     * Statistical Tank Data Analysis
     * Instrumentation Analysis
     * Risk Analysis

Tools

   Through the integration of these capabilities, the Lab has developed a
   set of tools that can be applied to specific waste tank situations to
   produce effective, safe procedures to characterize and mitigate
   dangerous waste tanks.
     * Data Collection and Management
     * Data Analysis
     * Theory Development
     * Simulant and Surrogate Testing
     * Actual Waste Testing
     * Actual Waste Directed Analysis
     * Measurement Method Development
