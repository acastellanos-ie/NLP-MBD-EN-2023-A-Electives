   purposes. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such
   monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of

   USDA Privacy Policy
   Thank you for visiting the ARS website and reviewing our privacy

   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,

   information about your visit automatically. This information does not
   identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
   following information about your visit:
    1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
       from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
       number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
       are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
    2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;

   personal information and submitting it to us through our website, we

   for you the information you have requested. We treat e-mails the same
   way that we regard letters sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   We are required to maintain many documents under the Presidential
   Records Act for historical purposes, but we do not collect personal
   information for any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share
   the information you give us with another government agency if your
   inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law.
   Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you
   provide or to give it to any private organizations. The U.S. Department
