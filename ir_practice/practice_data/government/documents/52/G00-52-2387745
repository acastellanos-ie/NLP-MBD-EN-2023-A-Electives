   Welcome to the Puget Sound Area Traffic Cameras website, brought to you
   by the Washington State Department of Transportation.
   This page provides access to snapshots and video clips from many of the
   cameras located along the major freeways in the Puget Sound area. Video
   clips are available at selected camera locations, while snapshots are
   available from each camera location. To view images from a particular
   camera, click on the appropriate camera icon (if using the clickable
   map), or the corresponding location (if using the text list).
   [MapGuide.gif] As shown in the adjacent Map Guide, cameras with both
   snapshot and video clips available are denoted with a round, yellow
   camera icon. Plain camera icons denote locations with only snapshots
   available.
   [Note: snapshots are 15-30 KB in size; video clips are approximately
   125 KB in size]
