                         Announcements and Email Lists

   Announcements of interest to NERSC's user community are made via email
   and saved in the individual archives listed below. NERSC also supports
   a number of user email lists. To subscribe to an email list use the
   subscription web form.

   See also the news articles from the NERSC Division at Berkeley Lab.

   The use of email lists and archives to announce changes started in
   August, 2000. To view announcements prior to August 1, 2000 see
   Announcements and Changes Prior to August, 2000
