The CUBIT Toolsuite

   CUBIT is a toolkit for robust and unattended generation of two- and
   three-dimensional finite element meshes (grids). Our main goal is to
   reduce the time, the user time, it takes to generate meshes, particular
   large hex meshes of complicated, interlocking assemblies. Verde and CGM
   are companion tools in the suite. CUBIT is a solid-modeler based
   preprocessor that meshes volumes and surfaces for finite element
   analysis. Mesh generation algorithms include quadrilateral and
   triangular paving, 2d and 3d mapping, hex sweeping and multi-sweeping,
   tet meshing, and various special-purpose primitives. Our smoothing
   algorithms are state of the art and are incorporated into volume
   sweeping. CUBIT contains many algorithms for controlling and automating
   much of the meshing process, such as automatic scheme selection,
   interval matching, sweep grouping, and sweep verification. One of
   CUBIT's strengths is its geometry module, for changing the underlying
   solid model into the model you wish to mesh. This is now available in
   library form to other applications, e.g. adaptivity, as the separate
   "Common Geometry Module"
   CGM.

SEACAS

   Many of the SEACAS tools work well with CUBIT; the SEAMS pre- and
   post-processing codes, database translation codes, and support
   libraries complement CUBIT's capabilities. SEACAS is also developed by
   Sandia, but is administered and licensed separately from CUBIT.
     * More information about getting SEACAS and SEAMS and their
       capabilities.
     * Documentation and manuals for SEACAS codes, libraries and formats.
     * Exodus II manual. Exodus II is the open mesh output format used by
       CUBIT.

CUBIT Licensing and Distribution:

   CUBIT research licenses are available free to all universities, and to
   the U.S. Government, and to U.S. Government laboratories, for
   non-commercial research.

   CUBIT commercial licenses are available to U.S. and non-U.S. companies,
   non-U.S. Government laboratories, and universities for commercial
   purposes. In addition to the standard end-user license, we are open to
   licensing CUBIT, selected algorithms in CUBIT, or the Common Geometry
   Module (CGM) for inclusion in other software.

   CUBIT is available on a wide variety of hardware platforms, including
   NT, Linux, and most Unix workstations.

   Obtaining a CUBIT License:
     * Everyone except Employees of Sandia National Laboratories
          + 1. Fill out a participant data sheet (pds). Get the Word
            document or Postscript.
          + 2. Write "Cubit Mesh Generation Toolkit" across the top of
            page one of the pds and fill out the rest of it. Then, for
            commercial Test and Evaluation licenses (with an eye towards
            commercial purchase) email (llmcnie@sandia.gov) or fax
            (505-843-4175) it to Linda McNiel. For academic or research
            licenses, email (slhealy@sandia.gov) or fax (505-844-4523) it
            to Sharon Healy. Also send the original signed pds via paper
            mail (to the address indicated on the pds). Linda or Sharon
            can also provide help in how to fill out the pds. Non-U.S.
            companies and individuals may be asked for some additional
            export control information.
          + 3. Once you have a license, we will issue you a password so
            that you can download the executable of your choice from the
            web.
     * Sandia Employees ONLY
          + 1. Email Bob Kerr your request, Include your organization
            number, and some indication of what you will use Cubit for
            (for internal tracking only.)
          + 2. We will issue you a password so that you can download the
            executable of your choice from the web.

   For technical information about CUBIT see the documentation, or contact
   Scott Mitchell, samitch@sandia.gov.
