      This toolkit contains a collection of visioning, design, and planning
      tools to aid in planning sustainable communities. It includes
      Geographic Information System (GIS) programs, predictive models, impact
      analysis programs, visualization programs and relevant information
      materials.

      This is a collection of technical and non-technical tools and
      resources, such as community visioning programs, GIS programs,
      interactive internet community networks, information resources, and
      group consensus building tools.

      This list is not meant to be exclusionary; it simply represents some of
      the tools we have collected over time.
