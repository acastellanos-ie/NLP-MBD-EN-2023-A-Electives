                               Agency Mission

   It is the mission of the WHRC to provide a regulatory foundation for
   all aspects of pari-mutuel horse racing in order to protect the public
   and assure the overall health of the industry.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Washington Horse Racing Commission, (WHRC), was created by the
   Wahington State legislature in March of 1933. By law, the WHRC is
   required to license, regulate and supervise all race meets held in the
   state. Governor Clarence D. Martin appointed the first commission,
   which consisted of Chairman Edwin J. Brown, Dr. A.R. Galbraith and
   Allen Drumheller. Pari-mutuel horse racing has been conducted in
   Washington every year since 1933, with the exception of 1943 when
   racing was cancelled due to the Second World War.
   Commissioners are appointed by the Governor and serve six-year terms.
   They may serve more than one term. Commissioners must be Washington
   citizens and residents and registered voters. One commissioner must be
   an active breeder of race horses in the state.
   Originally a three-member commission, the WHRC was expanded to five
   members in 1998. The current WHRC consists of:
     * Delores Sibonga, Chair
     * Hartly Kruger.
     * Patrick LePley,
     * Barbara Shinpoch, and
     * Judi Roland

   In addition to the WHRC members, four members of the Washington State
   Legislature are appointed ex-officio members. These are non-voting
   members whose duties are to assist in the policy-making, rather than
   administrative, functions of the commission, to collect data deemed
   essential to future legislative proposals and to exchange information
   with the commission. Two of these ex-officio members are appointed by
   the President of the Senete, one from each party, and two are appointed
   by the Speaker of the House, also one from each party. Ex-officio
   members serve two-year terms and may be reappointed.
   The ex officio members are:
     * Senator Marilyn Rasmussen
     * Senator James West
     * Representative Jack Cairnes.
     * Representative Eileen Cody,

   The WHRC also appoints an Executive Secretary and necessary staff to
   carry out its assigned duties and the day-to-day operation of the
   agency. The Executive Secretary is Bruce Batson.
   The WHRC duties include the awarding of licenses and racings dates to
   racing associations, establishing and enforcing the rules of racing,
   and collecting and distributing various economic incentive funds,
   including Washington-bred owners' bonus awards and the Class C purse
   and capital improvement funds.
   Statuatory authority for the WHRC is found in chapter 67.16 RCW.
   Rules and regulations promulgated by the WHRC are published under Title
   260 WAC.
