          Mars Odyssey successfully launched, and is on its way to Mars!

      [launch_t.jpg] NASA's return to Mars began at 11:02 a.m. Eastern time
      this morning as the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft roared into space
      onboard a Delta II launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force
      Station, Fla. About 53 minutes later, at 11:55 a.m. Eastern time,
      flight controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received the
      first signal from the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network station
      in Canberra, Australia indicating that all is well aboard the orbiter.

      The following launch replays are available:

      Real Video (requires Real Player plugin)
        * A 6-minute video from Kennedy Space Center. The video shows launch,
          solid rockets burnout and jettison, main engine cuttoff, 1st stage
          separation, 2nd stage ignition and fairings jettison.
        * A 7-minute video, courtesy of the Houston Chronicle. The video
          shows launch, solid rockets burnout and jettison, main engine
          cuttoff, 1st stage separation, 2nd stage ignition and fairings
          jettison.
        * A 3-minute video from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The video
          shows 2nd stage cuttoff, spinup of the spacecraft, and second stage
          separation.

      Quicktime animations courtesy of Spaceflight Now.

        * 1.3-minute animation (562K). This animation shows the launch
          through the burnout and jettision of the first six solid rocket
          motors.
        * 18-second animation - no audio (107K). This animations shows a
          ground view perspective of the launch.
        * 33-second animation (230K), This animation shows main engine
          cuttoff, 1st stage separation, 2nd stage ignition and fairings
          jettision.
        * 28-second animation (450K). This animation shows spinup of the
          spacecraft and second stage separation.
