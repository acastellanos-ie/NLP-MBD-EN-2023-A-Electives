                            LinkWinds Animations

   LinkWinds provides two tools which produce animations, one time based
   and the other frame based. The animations may be viewed immediately on
   the screen or saved to disk for later replay.

   [globeMay31_small.gif] Click on the image to the left for an mpeg
   animation (150 kb) made from images saved by the LinkWinds time-based
   animator. The data are ozone concentration at 21.54 mb as measured by
   the Microwave Limb Sounder from day 56 of the Upper Atmosphere Research
   Satellite mission. Red represents high ozone concentration and blue
   low. The southern hemisphere ozone hole is clearly visible.
