      Overview
              The Staudt Lab is focused on the molecular mechanisms causing
      human lymphoid malignancies. Many of the abnormalities in lymphomas,
      leukemias and multiple myeloma involve genes that also regulate normal
      lymphoid development. In particular, we are interested in the normal
      development of germinal center B cells since many of the non-Hodgkin's
      lymphomas are derived from cells that have passed through this
      developmental stage.
              A major current tool in the lab is genome-wide DNA microarray
      analysis of gene expression which is capable of quantitating the
      expression of tens of thousands of genes in parallel. We use this
      technology to view the gene expression profiles of distinct stages of
      lymphoid development and compare these to the gene expression profiles
      of human lymphoid malignancies. This approach will ultimately provide a
      new molecular classification of these cancers.
              A complementary and parallel effort in the lab is aimed at
      understanding how individual oncogenes and tumor suppressors cause
      lymphomas. One oncogene that we are studying is BCL-6, the most
      frequently translocated gene in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Using
      BCL-6 knockout animals, we found that BCL-6 is required for the normal
      development of germinal center B cells, the same cells that give rise
      to a variety of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. We are studying the mechanism
      of action of BCL-6 and other regulatory factors by coupling DNA
      microarray technology with defined genetic manipulations of these
      factors in mice and in cell lines. The assembled database of these gene
      expression observations is providing a detailed view of the gene
      expression "physiology" of normal and malignant lymphocytes. By
      understanding which genes are controlled by individual factors and
      signaling pathways, we are defining new molecular targets for therapy
      in lymphoid malignancies.
