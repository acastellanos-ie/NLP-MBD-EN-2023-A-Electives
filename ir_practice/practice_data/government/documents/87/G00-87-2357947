                   Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program
             In Response to the September 11th Terrorist Attacks

   The Bureau of Justice Assistance is committed to making assistance
   available through the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program in the
   most expeditious, helpful, and sensitive manner possible. BJA has
   followed the Attorney Generals directive to exercise the full scope of
   our discretion under the governing statute and applicable regulations
   to facilitate prompt payment of claims resulting from the September
   11th terrorist attacks.

   BJA staff has met with benefits coordinators for most of the
   departments affected by this tragedy and we have pledged to work with
   them to provide the best possible support for the surviving families.
   BJA can best serve the families if they work through their departments'
   benefits coordinators.
