e-MONITOR
Environmental Monitoring on line in real-time of Radiation

   The laboratory is proud of its having no impact on the health and
   safety of its neighbors. For almost fifty years monitoring information
   has been shared with regulatory agencies and the public. In the past
   this information was in the form of printed documents; more recently
   these documents are available on this web site. The documents generally
   show data from the past year or so in a form helpful to regulators and
   our environmental scientists.

   Now information about the gamma radiation on the Laboratory perimeters
   is available on this web site just nanoseconds after our detectors see
   it. The graphic displays include - comparisons to the Federal Standard
   for offsite releases of radiation. Just hit the icon below to see the
   current readings or to look at a history of those readings. Public
   Access Real Time Direct Radiation at LLNL

   Also in this web site you will find information on radiation from a
   number of sources, including how to calculate your average annual
   radiation exposure from natural and man-made sources.

   If you have any questions about the e-MONITOR or the Laboratory's
   impact on the environment, please contact me Bert Heffner at
   heffner1@llnl.gov or 925-424-4026.
