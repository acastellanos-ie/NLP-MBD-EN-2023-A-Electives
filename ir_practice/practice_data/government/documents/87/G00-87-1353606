Examples

   Several examples of the inputs and outputs of CFAST are included below.
   These are not meant to be all-inclusive. Rather, they provide and
   overview of the calculations and displays available from the CFAST
   model.

   [3rcorr.gif] The first is a simulation of tests which were performed in
   the full scale test facility at NIST and involved three rooms, a burn
   room, a corridor and a target room. The experiments were actually a
   series of 11 replicate tests with simple steady-state gas burner fires
   which was used for evaluation of the model's predictive capability.
   This movie (183K) shows the long corridor (20 m) calculation in both
   plan and elevation view. The CFAST data file for this simulation is
   also available.

   Plaza Hotel Simulation By far the most complex example presented here
   is a simulation from a series of real-scale experiments conducted to
   evaluate zoned smoke control systems, with and without stairwell
   pressurization. It was conducted in a seven story hotel with multiple
   rooms on each floor and a stairwell and elevator shaft connecting to
   all floors. The movie (242K) shows the fire floor of the hotel in plan
   view and the entire structure in elevation view. A graph and table of
   calculated values show the output of the model. The CFAST data file for
   this simulation is also available.

   Nike Site demo The third is a simulation of a fire in an army barracks
   and was a test of the effectiveness of using door closing as a
   preventative measure to prevent the spread of toxic gases. The fire
   source in a room off a long corridor was a burning mattress. A third
   room off the corridor includes a nearly closed door to simulate leakage
   around the doorway. The movie (122K) shows the facility in plan view
   and includes a table of calculated values showing some of the outputs
   of the model. The CFAST data file for this simulation is also
   available.
