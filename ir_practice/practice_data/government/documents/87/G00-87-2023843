   Josefina G. Carbonell, Assistant Secretary for Aging Josefina G.
   Carbonell was sworn in as Assistant Secretary for Aging at the
   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on August 8, 2001.

   The Administration on Aging (AoA) is the federal focal point and
   advocate agency for older Americans and their concerns. The AoA is
   dedicated to preparing America to meet the challenges and to maximize
   the opportunities presented by the longevity of its people. AoA through
   its network that reaches into every community presents older Americans
   and their families with: information and referral, outreach, case
   management, transportation, personal care, home-delivered and
   congregate meals, adult day care, elder abuse prevention, health
   promotion, legal assistance, and other services. The AoA also provides
   support for family caregivers of older persons who are chronically ill
   or who have disabilities. In addition, AoA provides support and fosters
   research, demonstration, and training programs to better serve older
   Americans.

   Prior to joining HHS, Carbonell was President and CEO of Little Havana
   Activities & Nutrition Centers (LHANC) in Dade County, Florida, an
   organization she helped establish in 1972. Carbonell's leadership,
   coupled with solid management skills, transformed the one-site agency
   into the largest aging, health and nutrition project in Florida and the
   largest Hispanic geriatric health and human service organization in the
   nation. The LHANC currently operates 21 sites, serving more than 55,000
   registered clients.

   During her tenure at LHANC, Carbonell led efforts to implement
   Florida's "Volunteer Health Professionals Program" and established the
   Pro-Salud Clinic, a state pilot program providing primary health care,
   preventive screening, health promotion and medication control to older
   adults and their families. The Pro-Salud Clinic has expanded to include
   a spectrum of health and wellness programs specializing in geriatric
   and intergenerational health services.

   Carbonell is nationally recognized for her work and is the recipient of
   numerous awards, including the 2001 Claude Pepper Community Service
   Award, the 1997 Social Security Administration Commissioner's Team
   Award, the 1997 United Way Monsignor Bryan Walsh Outstanding Human
   Service Award, the 1995 National Alliance for Hispanic Health Community
   Service Award, the Miami Herald Charles Whited Spirit of Excellence
   Award in 1993, and the 1992 Miami Citizen of Year Award.

   Carbonell attended Florida International University and was the
   recipient of a fellowship in health management at the John F. Kennedy
   School of Government at Harvard University, and is an alumnus of the
   Program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government.

   Born in Cuba, Carbonell is a devoted daughter to her parents and proud
   mother to her son, Alfredo, a physician completing his residency in
   Michigan.
