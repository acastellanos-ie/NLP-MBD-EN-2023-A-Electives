   1. Why has Executive Order 13178 been issued?
   Coral reefs are in trouble all over the world. They are being degraded
   and destroyed at rapid rates by warming of the ocean, pollution,
   over-fishing and a host of other factors. At the National Ocean
   Conference in 1998, action was taken to help save U.S. coral reefs by
   establishing the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force and to direct federal
   agencies to avoid harming coral reefs. Approximately 70 percent of all
   coral reefs located in U. S. waters surround the Northwestern Hawaiian
   Islands (NWHI). These extensive reef systems are some of the most
   pristine reefs left in U.S. waters. In May 2000, the Secretaries of
   Commerce and Interior, working cooperatively with the State of Hawaii
   and consulting with the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management
   Council, were directed to develop recommendations for a new,
   coordinated management regime to increase protection of the coral reef
   ecosystem of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and provide for
   sustainable use of the area. Upon consideration of the recommendations
   following the interagency discussions and recommendations following the
   public visioning sessions, Executive Order 13178 was issued,
   establishing the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve to provide immediate
   protection for the NWHI coral reef ecosystem. It is intended to bring
   together state and federal agencies to help address the global coral
   reef crisis by protecting this national treasure for future
   generations.

   2. What does a Reserve designation mean?
   This is a new marine protected area designation under authority
   provided to the President under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act
   (NMSA or Act), as amended by the NMSA Amendments Act of 2000 (P.L.
   106-513). This Act authorizes the President to designate any
   Northwestern Hawaiian Islands coral reef or coral reef ecosystem as a
   coral reef reserve. The Reserve will be managed by the Secretary of
   Commerce, in a manner consistent with the purposes and policies of the
   NMSA, and in accordance with the Executive Order. NOAA is also directed
   to begin the process to designate the Reserve as a National Marine
   Sanctuary.

   3. Where are the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands?
   The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are a chain of small islands, atolls,
   submerged banks, and reefs beginning approximately 120 nautical miles
   west of the main Hawaiian islands, and stretching northwest for more
   than 1,079 nautical miles or 2,000 kilometers. This vast archipelago is
   uninhabited (except for Midway Island) and is surrounded by some of the
   most extensive and pristine coral reefs in U.S. waters. The coral reefs
   are part of a unique marine ecosystem found nowhere else on Earth. The
   reefs and related ecosystems include a diverse variety of habitats
   extending from the archipelago's shorelines to approximately 50
   nautical miles offshore, and to depths of 100 fathoms (183 meters).

   (top)

     __________________________________________________________________

   4. What is so special about the NWHI?
   Approximately 70% of all coral reefs in U.S. waters are in the NWHI.
   The NWHI ecosystem includes approximately 13,000 square kilometers or
   3,600 square nautical miles of coral reefs with a diverse and unique
   assemblage of fish, invertebrates, birds, sea turtles, marine mammals
   and other species. The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands include a much
   greater diversity of reef habitats than the main Hawaiian Islands, and
   are home to a variety of federally protected species, including the
   threatened green sea turtle, seabirds, and the only remaining
   population of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal.
   The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands provide vital habitat for a variety
   of migratory species, including several species of marine mammals
   (e.g., spotted dolphins, humpback whales), sea turtles, and over 14
   million seabirds that use the ecosystems for nesting, feeding and
   raising young.
   Numerous archaeological artifacts found on several of the islands
   establish a close relationship with the Hawaiian culture, with evidence
   of both prehistoric seasonal and permanent settlements, as well as use
   of the area for religious purposes. Some of the religious sites
   resemble those found elsewhere in the Marquesas and Tahiti, possibly
   indicating a link to early Polynesian cultures. The more recent history
   of the islands is one of both commercial and military usage for a range
   of purposes, from pearling and fishing to guano mining, which wrought
   significant changes in topography, flora and fauna. This area is also
   the site of one of the oldest National Wildlife Refuges, the Hawaiian
   Islands National Wildlife Refuge, designated in 1909 by President
   Theodore Roosevelt.

     __________________________________________________________________

   5. What activities currently occur in the NWHI coral reef ecosystem?
   There is relatively little human activity currently taking place in the
   NWHI. Today, Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge is the only one of
   these fragile, remote islands open for public visitation. Tourists are
   invited to visit Midway to learn about and enjoy its unique wildlife,
   marine and historic resources. The number of visitors allowed on the
   atoll at any one time is limited to reduce impacts to wildlife. A small
   number of photographers and film crews are permitted to work in the
   Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge to provide
   information to the public. Additionally, the University of Hawaii at
   Hilo offers courses.
   Only one fishery (bottomfish) is currently active in federal waters of
   the NWHI; two additional Fishery Management Plans for crustaceans
   (lobster) and precious corals, that are not currently active. There is
   also some recreational fishing in the area. Federal and state agencies
   conduct a variety of other activities, such as research, monitoring and
   enforcement, to fulfill their management responsibilities for federal
   and state resources, including the Midway Atoll and Hawaiian Island
   National Wildlife Refuges, and the state wildlife refuge on Kure to
   help protect and recover protected, threatened and endangered species.
   The NWHI coral reef ecosystem is also the site of ongoing scientific
   and monitoring activities to explore, map and better understand the
   unique ecosystem. These efforts are often joint projects among many
   partners, including the National Marine Fisheries Service, Fish and
   Wildlife Service, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the
   University of Hawaii, and others.

     __________________________________________________________________

   6. What are the primary ecosystem threats to the NWHI?
   Some of the primary threats to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are
   from natural processes such as major winter storms, periodic
   hurricanes, and tidal waves. In the mid-1970s to late 1980s, changing
   oceanographic conditions (decadal shift) may have caused the islands'
   biological productivity to decrease, affecting food availability for
   all of the resident animals.
   Major anthropogenic threats to the ecosystem are marine debris,
   invasive species and possible overuse by humans. Such "overuse" by
   people includes a number of different activities, e.g., vessel
   groundings, pollution from ships and other vessels, derelict fishing
   gear, derelict military and commercial infrastructure, land
   development, the introduction of alien species, and ecotourism impacts.
   Concern has been raised about fishing interactions with monk seals,
   lobster trap impacts on coral reefs, marine mammal entanglement in
   fisheries debris, seal consumption of toxic discards, and prey
   depletion. Although strictly regulated, recreational and commercial
   fishing are among the more contentious management issues in the area.
   Ocean currents have deposited thousands of tons of marine debris and
   derelict fishing gear from the North Pacific onto the islands, atolls,
   and reefs of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The nets and lines can
   entangle and drown monk seals, sea turtles, seabirds, as well as scour
   coral reefs. Floating plastic debris is eaten by adult seabirds and fed
   to their young. Marine debris is also thought to be a potential conduit
   for the accelerated introduction of alien species to coral reef
   ecosystems.

     __________________________________________________________________

   7. What kinds of fishery pressures now exist?
   The fisheries of the NWHI are small in terms of the number of vessels
   that participate, and the volume and value of the fisheries landings.
   These managed fisheries appear to have a relatively small impact on the
   coral reef ecosystem, especially when compared to the impacts of
   derelict fishing gear from outside of Hawaii, other marine debris, and
   other human impacts. The Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management
   Councils Proposed Coral Reef Ecosystem Fishery Management Plan provides
   for management of a variety of types of marine harvesting (e.g.,
   ornamental fish, live rock, bioprospecting) as well as commercially
   harvested species.
   The Bottomfish Fishery consists of two limited entry zones: one with 7
   permits (around Nihoa and Necker Islands) and another with 10 permits
   (the distant islands out to Kure Atoll). The total number of active
   vessels in the fishery has ranged from 3 to 13 (7 in 1998). Total
   annual revenues from the fishery have averaged about $1million/year.
   The managed bottomfish species are healthy.
   The Crustaceans (Spiny and Slipper Lobster) Fishery consists of a
   limited entry fishery (capped at 15 permits) of which fewer than half
   are active (1 vessel in 1995, 9 in 1997, and 6 vessels making 6 total
   trips in 1998). The fishery is closed from December 1 to June 30 of
   each year to reduce the potential for affecting monk seals during the
   pupping season. Fishing is prohibited in closed areas within 20 nm of
   Laysan Island and within 10 fathoms around all of the NWHI. The fishery
   is currently closed pending the resolution of uncertainties in the
   current stock assessment model.
   The Pelagics (Swordfish, Tuna species, others) Fishery is prohibited
   within a 50 nm zone around the NWHI and thus exerts no fishing pressure
   on the area.
   The Precious Corals Fishery is managed under the comprehensive
   Fisheries Management Plan, and the fishery is not currently active.

   8. What was the NWHI directive issued last May, and what has been
   accomplished since the announcement?
   In May 2000, the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior were directed
   to develop a plan to provide strong and lasting protection for the NWHI
   coral reef ecosystem. Specifically, the Secretaries of the Interior and
   Commerce, in coordination with the State of Hawaii and in consultation
   with the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (Council),
   initiated an administrative process to cooperatively develop
   recommendations for a new, coordinated management regime.

   This process began with "visioning" sessions, which were open hearings
   for public comment on the future of the NWHI coral reef ecosystem.
   These public visioning sessions provided extensive input from a wide
   variety of groups that helped shape the final recommendations.
   Additional input on the future of the NWHI was gathered from other
   sources, such as the extensive public input and research conducted by
   the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council in development
   of its Coral Reef Ecosystem Fishery Management Plan.

   On December 4, 2000 the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef
   Ecosystem Reserve was created, pursuant to the NMSA, as amended by the
   NMSA Amendments of 2000. The Reserve encompasses an area of the marine
   waters and submerged lands of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands
   extending approximately 1200 nautical miles long and 100 nautical miles
   wide. As part of the establishment of the Reserve, Executive Order
   13178 contains conservation measures that restrict some activities
   throughout the Reserve, and establishes Reserve Preservation Areas
   around certain islands, atolls and banks. With certain exceptions, all
   consumptive uses are restricted within the Reserve Preservation Areas.
   The Executive Order also directed the Secretary of Commerce to manage
   the Reserve and initiate a process to designate the Reserve a National
   Marine Sanctuary.

   A 30 day public comment period was held to receive comments regarding
   whether to make permanent the Reserve Preservation Areas. Comments were
   also requested on the conservation measures for the Reserve. The
   Secretary of Commerce, on behalf of the White House, received public
   comments and held seven public hearings, six throughout the main
   Hawaiian Islands, and one in Washington, D.C. in December, 2000.
   Approximately 8,400 comments were received and considered in the final
   decision making. (Click to obtain a summary of public comments. Comment
   Summary, pdf format)

   On January 18, 2001, after considering the comments received, the
   process and establishment of the Reserve was finalized by issuance of
   Executive Order 13196. This Executive Order modified Executive Order
   13178 by revising certain conservation measures and making permanent
   the Reserve Preservation Areas with modifications. With this action,
   the establishment of the Reserve, including the conservation measures
   and permanent Reserve Preservation Areas, is complete. (Click to obtain
   a summary of changes made by E.O. 13196. Amendment Summary, pdf

   9. What is the size of the Reserve?
   The area designated as the Reserve is 131,800 square statute miles or
   99,500 square nautical miles. It is approximately 1.200 statute miles
   long and 100 miles wide. This is seven times the size of the existing
   area in the National Marine Sanctuary System, and is as large as the
   entire National Park System or the combined areas of Florida and
   Georgia. The Reserve will include marine waters and submerged lands of
   the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, shall be adjacent to and seaward of
   the boundary of Hawaii State waters and submerged lands and the Midway
   Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, and will include the Hawaiian Islands
   National Wildlife Refuge to the extent it extends beyond Hawaii State
   waters and submerged lands.

                                             84,365,000

   Some comparisons: The Reserve is, about half the size of Texas, is
   comparable in length to the distance from Los Angeles to Seattle, is 7
   times larger than the total area of the current 13 National Marine
   Sanctuaries, and is almost as large as the Great Barrier Reef Marine
   Park in Australia (102,043 nm^2.) The Reserve is the second largest
   marine protected area in the world, and is the largest protected area
   in U.S. history.

     __________________________________________________________________

   10. What is the area of coral reef habitat under federal jurisdiction
   within the Reserve?
   While the actual coral reefs extend only extend to about 50 fathoms
   (100 meters), other habitats with important interactions with the reefs
   extend to approximately 100 fathoms. Approximately 3.3 percent (2.7
   million acres) of the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve is coral reef
   habitat (all submerged areas <100 fathoms) under Federal jurisdiction
   (excluding State waters).

   The approximate total area of coral reef habitat (all submerged areas
   <100 fathoms) under federal jurisdiction (excluding State waters):

   4,300 square statute miles

                             3,250 square nautical miles

   11,140 square kilometers

                             2,753,000 acres

   (top)

     __________________________________________________________________

   11. What is the area of the Preservation Areas? How much of the Reserve
   is in the Preservation Areas?
   Approximately 4.8 percent of the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve is
   within the 15 Reserve Preservation Areas. The approximate total area of
   reserve preservation areas in the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve
   area is:

   6,350 square statute miles

                             4,795 square nautical miles

   16,450 square kilometers

                             4,065,000 acres

   This area is larger that previously reported because of 12 nm buffers
   surrounding Pearl Bank and Hermes Bank

   (top)

     __________________________________________________________________

   12. What is the Reserve Council, how was it selected, how will it
   operate?
   The Secretary of Commerce was directed to establish a Coral Reef
   Ecosystem Reserve Council, pursuant to the National Marine Sanctuaries
   Act authorities for advisory councils. The Council provides advice and
   recommendations to NOAA on the Reserve Operations Plan and designation
   and management of any sanctuary. The Council plays an important role in
   helping shape conservation initiatives and provide lasting protection
   to the marine resources of the Reserve and sanctuary. Council members
   represent various aspects of the community from recreational fishing
   interests to Native Hawaiian interests.

   The voting members of the Council (except for the State of Hawaii
   representative) were chosen through an open, competitive process held
   during December 2000 and January 2001. A call for applications was
   published in the Federal Register and posted on this website.
   Forty-seven applications were received, and fourteen of these
   applicants were chosen by NOAA, in consultation with the State of
   Hawaii and the Department of the Interior, to become members of the
   Council. Non-voting members and the Hawaiian state representative were
   chosen by the organization they represent in a separate process.
   Members were announced on January 29, 2001. There are 15 voting
   representatives and 10 nonvoting representatives. An alternate will be
   chosen for each seat to ensure adequate representation should a Council
   member be unable to attend a meeting. A call for applications for
   alternates was published in the Federal Register on February 5, 2001,
   and applications were accepted through March 2, 2001. Applicants not
   chosen for the original Council seats were automatically entered into
   the pool of applicants. Alternates will be selected through the same
   process as Council members. The Council will operate under a charter
   developed by NOAA, which prescribes the frequency of meetings,
   objectives and roles, and operation of the Council. The Council was
   officially established on December 5, 2000, when the charter was
   signed. All travel costs to meeting locations for Council members are
   paid for by NOAA, unless members are federal employees. Council
   meetings are open to the public.

     __________________________________________________________________

   13. What types of management actions will be put in place in the
   Reserve?
   The Executive Order provides Management Principles, conservation
   measures, and Reserve Preservation Areas for the Reserve, and directs
   the Secretary to develop a Reserve Operations Plan. The Reserve will
   build on existing efforts and encourage strong partnerships to fulfill
   its protection and management functions. Management actions will
   include monitoring and removal of marine debris; research; monitoring
   and assessment of the Reserve's resources; and enforcement of the
   conservation measures and the Reserve Preservation Areas.

   Activities prohibited in the Reserve include: exploration for oil and
   gas, anchoring on coral; drilling, dredging, or otherwise altering the
   seabed; discharging or depositing any material (except for gray water);
   and removal, taking, or harvesting any living or non-living coral reef
   resource or species except as expressly allowed in the Executive Order.
   All consumptive activities (e.g. fishing, taking of coral) are
   prohibited in Reserve Preservation areas, except for the stipulations
   found in the Executive Order regarding commercial bottomfishing and
   trolling for pelagics by recreational fishers and permitted
   bottomfishers in 10 of the 15 RPAs.

   Management techniques, such as marine zoning, will also ensure
   ecosystem protection from degradation and harm. Additionally,
   non-regulatory activities such as research, education and outreach,
   restoration and remediation of degraded and injured Reserve resources
   will be developed working with many partners, in conjunction with the
   Reserve Operations Plan and Sanctuary Management Plan development
   processes. The Reserve Advisory Council will also be an important
   component in identifying issues, and disseminating information about
   management measures to the various users of the Reserve.

   (top)

     __________________________________________________________________

   14. How will you enforce the management measures?
   NOAA will apply its authority under the National Marine Sanctuaries
   Act. The Act promotes cooperative enforcement with other government
   agencies, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
   National Marine Fisheries Service, and state fisheries authorities.
   Efforts to enforce new Reserve prohibitions will build upon the
   existing efforts by these agencies. Enforcement issues and strategies
   will be addressed in the the Reserve Operations Plan and Sanctuary
   Management Plan. As such, at this point in time, enforcement of the new
   restrictions will focus on eduation of the regulated community as the
   details of the enforcement plan are developed. Investigations of
   egregious violations, however, will proceed, giving due consideration
   to the overall goal of coral reef protection. NOAA will also continue
   to apply its enforcement authorities under other laws, including the
   Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal
   Protection Act.

     __________________________________________________________________

   15. How will a Reserve correct the problem of marine debris in the
   Hawaiian Islands?
   The Reserve will build upon the existing efforts of the interagency
   partnership, including the recommendations outlined at the 2000 Marine
   Debris Conference, to clean up this very serious threat to the
   resources in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. This also includes
   bringing to bear new authorities and resources to address the problem.
   The new authorities prohibit destruction, loss or injury to any Reserve
   or Sanctuary resources. Efforts may also include working with U.S.
   Department of State, the U.S. Coast Guard and the International
   Maritime Organization to address the issue of preventing the debris at
   its source.

   (top)

     __________________________________________________________________

   16. How will this affect Native Hawaiians or the State of Hawaii?
   Native Hawaiians have a strong traditional connection to the land and
   natural resources of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and NOAA wants
   to encourage their participation in management of this protected area.
   The Reserve recognizes Native Hawaiian non-commercial subsistence,
   cultural, and religious uses consistent with existing law. NOAA will
   work with Native Hawaiian interests to identify those areas where uses
   of the Reserve's resources may be conducted without injury to coral
   reef ecosystem or related marine resources or species. These areas may
   be revised after public review and comment and consideration of
   recommendations from the Reserve Council. While state waters and
   submerged lands are not part of the Reserve, NOAA will work with the
   state and the Department of Interior for coordinated conservation of
   the area. During the sanctuary designation process NOAA will work with
   the state to determine whether state waters and submerged lands should
   be included in a sanctuary.

     __________________________________________________________________

   17. Will a Reserve affect the existing fishing industry in NWHI?
   Fisheries have always been very limited in these remote island areas.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Western Pacific
   Regional Fishery Management Council have strictly limited existing
   fisheries in the NWHI. This has been done under the authority of the
   Magnuson-Stevens Act, Executive Order 13196 and the four Fishery
   Management Plans for this region.

   The Executive Order caps all existing fishing effort at current levels.
   In addition it provides for 15 Reserve Preservation Areas (RPA). All
   consumptive uses are not permitted in the Reserve Preservation Areas.
   However, commercial bottomfishing and trolling for pelagics by
   recreational fishers and permitted bottomfishers is allowed in portions
   of 10 RPAs. The 15 RPAs have been made permanent after consideration
   based on a 30-day public comment period.

   (top)

     __________________________________________________________________

   18. Why cap current fishing efforts?
   During the public visioning session on the future of the NWHI, many
   people expressed concern that growth in fishing efforts in the NWHI
   could harm the coral reef ecosystem. While the commercial fisheries of
   the NWHI are not overfished, some believe that capping fishing at
   current levels is a sound management step both to provide long-term
   protection of the ecosystem and to allow for some continued extractive
   use of the area through fishing. NOAA will develop the caps based on
   the Executive Order and publish them for public input.

   (top)

     __________________________________________________________________

   19. Who will manage fisheries within the Reserve?
   NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, working with the Western
   Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council and NOAA's National Ocean
   Service, will continue to have a direct role in managing the fisheries
   of the NWHI. These entities will work closely to manage the fisheries
   in accordance with Executive Orders 13178 and 13196.

   (top)

     __________________________________________________________________

   20. How much of the Reserve will be closed to all fishing?
   Some or all fishing activities are restricted in the Preservation
   Areas, which make up approximately 4.8 percent of the total Reserve
   area. Five of these areas are completely closed to all fishing, while
   portions of the remaining 10 allow some extractive use. Outside of
   these Preservation Areas, fishing is capped at current levels. The
   exact level of those will be determined by NOAA, on behalf of the
   Secretary, in consultation with the Reserve Advisory Council, the State
   of Hawaii, the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, and
   others.

   21. How will the boundaries for the Reserve Preservation Areas (RPA) be
   determined?
   The RPA boundaries are approximated using fathoms. ONMS, on behalf of
   the Secretary, will develop straight line boundaries based on longitude
   and latitude coordinates to encompass each RPA, to provide for clarity
   and ease of identification. ONMS may make technical modifications to
   these boundaries, as necessary. (For additional information on RPAs,

   22. Does this designation mean I can still take my boat out into the
   Reserve to dive?
   Yes. Diving is allowed if undertaken in accordance with the
   conservation measures. These measures include no anchoring on coral,
   and no removal, moving, taking, harvesting, or damaging of any living
   or non-living coral resource or species. For example, spearfishing in a
   Reserve Preservation Area would not be allowed, but underwater
   photography would be.

   23. How will this impact ecotourism?
   NOAA recognizes that an increase in ecotourism is of significant
   concern. Any Sanctuary management plan will detail how
   ecotoursim-related activities will be permitted and regulated within
   the protected area. All uses must be consistent with the management
   principles in the Executive Order and would be subject to the
   conservation measures and Reserve Preservation Areas. These principles
   emphasize protection and conservation of the coral reef ecosystem and
   the related marine resources and species of the NWHI.

   24. How will this Reserve interact with the Department of the Interior
   and the National Fish and Wildlife Refuges?
   The Executive Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to work with the
   Department of the Interior and the State of Hawaii to develop a
   memorandum of agreement (MOA) for coordinated conservation and
   management of the Reserve, the Midway Atoll and Hawaiian Islands
   National Wildlife Refuges, and state waters and submerged lands. Where
   the Reserve overlaps the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, the
   Reserve shall be managed to supplement and complement the refuge. It is
   expected that cooperative effort will look beyond jurisdictional
   boundaries and ensure viability of the region's collective resources
   for generations to come.

   25. How will the Reserve be funded?
   The National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000 authorizes $4
   million for the Reserve and the designation of the Reserve as a marine
   sanctuary for each year through 2005. These efforts could be funded
   through the Commerce, State and Justice appropriations for NOAA. NOAA
   has currently received funds in its appropriations for coral reef
   conservation activities. It is expected that a portion of these funds
   will be used for activities involving the Reserve. The National Marine
   Sanctuaries System will provide support through the utilization of
   staff resources and expertise. NOAA will also work with state partners
   to make the most efficient use of the existing resources in the NWHI.

   26. How long will it take to designate a sanctuary?
   It is expected that the Sanctuary designation process will take two to
   three years. During this time, public input will be sought to determine
   the most appropriate resource protection and management measures for
   NWHI marine resources and their use. In additon, Public input will be
   solicited on the protection of historical/cultural resources consistent
   with the management principles in the Executive Order.

   The designation process will benefit from the advice and
   recommendations of the Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve Council established
   by NOAA. The Reserve Council includes representatives from the
   non-federal science community, Native Hawaiian interests, the State of
   Hawaii, the commercial and recreational fishing industries,
   environmental organizations, the ocean-related tourism industries and
   others. Throughout the designation process, NOAA will work closely with
   all governmental and non-governmental partners.

   Currently NOAA is working on the Reserve Operations Plan. This plan
   will be completed by the summer of 2001. NOAA has issued a notice of
   intent in the Federal Register to begin the Sanctuary Designation
   Process. These activities are expected to develop in tandem.

   27. What if the Sanctuary is not designated?
   Should the Sanctuary not be designated before October 1, 2005, the NMSA
   directs that the Secretary shall conduct a review of the management of
   the Reserve.

   28. What are the next steps?

   The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) is developing the
   draft Reserve Operations Plan and will seek the recommendations of the
   Reserve Advisory Council. The ONMS will also consult with the State of
   Hawaii and the Department of the Interior on the Plan. Once a draft
   Plan is finalized, a public comment period will provide an opportunity
   for comments. After consideration of comments received, the Plan will
   be finalized.

   In addition, the ONMS will begin the sanctuary designation process.
   Initial steps involve working with the Reserve Advisory Council to
   develop a vision, goals, and objectives for the sanctuary, holding
   public scoping meetings to elicit comments, and developing assessments
   of the area in consideration.
