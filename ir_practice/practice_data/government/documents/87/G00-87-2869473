   About Us
       The Federal Housing Finance Board regulates the 12 FHLBanks that
       were created in 1932 to improve the supply of funds to local
       lenders that, in turn, finance loans for home mortgages. The board
       also has regulatory authority and supervisory oversight
       responsibility for the Office of Finance.
       Today, the FHLBanks and their 7,777 member-owners, which constitute
       the FHLBank System, form a cooperative partnership that continues
       to help finance the country's urban and rural housing and community
       development needs. This partnership supports community-based
       financial institutions and facilitates their access to credit.
       The Finance Board ensures that the FHLBanks, which are privately
       capitalized, government-sponsored enterprises, operate in a safe
       and sound manner, carry out their housing and community development
       finance mission, and remain adequately capitalized and able to
       raise funds in the capital markets.
       The Finance Board is an independent regulatory agency of the
       executive branch of the U.S. Government, with a five-member board.
       Four board members are appointed by the President for seven-year
       terms, and the fifth member is the Secretary of the Department of
       Housing and Urban Development, or the secretary's designee.
