Solder Interconnect Design

   [gull.gif] [gullmov.gif]

   The Solder Interconnect Design Group is developing and evaluating
   several methods for modeling the geometries which arise in solder
   interconnects. Improved modeling of these systems will allow for more
   efficient development and implementation of industrial electronic
   packaging processes.
