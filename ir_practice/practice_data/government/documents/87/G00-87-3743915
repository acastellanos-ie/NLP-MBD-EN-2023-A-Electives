                          Goddard Pond Information

   The Goddard Ponds are man-made drainage control ponds. Their original
   purpose was to manage water run-off from GSFC parking lots and roads. A
   2 pond system was constructed, a small 1/4 acre feeder pond and a 2.5
   acre pond. The larger pond was constructed where a small stream was
   flowing.

   Beginning in 1989, a stocking and pond management program was started.
   Largemouth bass, yellow perch, black & white crappie, silver channel
   catfish, and bluegills were stocked, and over the years have
   successfully reproduced. In 1994, hybrid carp were introduced to help
   control the excessive water plant growth, which occurs in late summer.
   Pond stocking was performed in 1994, and 1999 (largemouth bass and
   catfish)

   The policy for fishing at the Goddard Pond is that you must be a member
   of the Goddard Sport Fishing Club,and obey all rules which apply
   towards membership. Yearly dues are $3.00 per year. Fishing at the
   Goddard Pond is strictly "Catch and Release."

   Most people fish the structure around the pond with artificials.
   Natural baits catch panfish. Try using nighcrawlers, and even hotdogs,
   to catch catfish and largemouth. The largemouth bass average 2 pounds,
   largest recorded 6 pounds. Catching a small panfish and placing on a
   hook with float will get largemouth strikes. Large catfish will also
   take small panfish. Catfish better than 10 pounds are caught using this
   method. Small jigs catch crappie.

   Other wildlife may be seen at the Goddard Pond on any given day. Geese,
   deer, fox, bluebirds,turtles, beavers, muskrat, snakes, and other
   animals may be observed around the Pond perimeter. Please be advised
   that large turtles and huge snapping turtles are everywhere in the
   pond. These large turtles can inflict serious wounds.
