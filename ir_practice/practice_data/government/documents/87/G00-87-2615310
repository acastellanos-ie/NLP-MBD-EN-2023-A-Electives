                          Where Desert Meets City:

       Vulnerability and Recoverability of the Mojave Desert Ecosystem

   Casinos at Primm

   USGS conducts a Mojave Desert Ecosystem Science Program as part of its
   Place-Based Studies Program, to improve scientific understanding of
   desert ecosystem processes and apply that understanding to land
   management needs.

   "Ghost Towns Tell Tales of Ecological Boom and Bust"
    An article by Kathryn Brown in SCIENCE (Oct. 6, 2000; pp. 35 - 37)
   describes scientific research
   on going as part of this and other USGS desert projects.  It highlights
   the key role of soil age in vegetation
   and compaction recovery.

   The Lasting Effects of Tank Maneuvers on Desert Soils and Intershrub
   Flora
   Douglas V. Prose and Howard Wilshire; USGS Open File Report OF 00-512
           Recovery rates for Mojave vegetation and soils following
   military maneuvers with tanks in the 1940s and 1964.

   Recovery of Perennial Vegetation in Military Target Sites in the
   Eastern Mojave Desert, Arizona
   John W. Steiger and Robert H. Webb; USGS Open File Report OF 00-355

     A study of the effect of the age of geomorphic surfaces on the
     recovery of desert vegetation in military target sites in the Mojave
     and Cerbat Mountains for northwestern Arizona.
