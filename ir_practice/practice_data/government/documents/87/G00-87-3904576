                                 Our Mission

     The Beltsville Area consists of Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
   programs at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville,
     MD; the US National Arboretum in Washington, D.C.; and worksites in
     Chatsworth, NJ; Presque Isle, ME; and McMinnville, TN. BARC is the
      largest and most diversified agricultural research complex in the
                                   world.

   Beltsville's record of accomplishments and ongoing programs has made it
    a world leader in agriculture research. Its international reputation
     attracts thousands of visitors each year from the United States and
     abroad. ARS conducts research to develop and transfer solutions to
   agricultural problems of high national priority and provide information
                    access and dissemination in order to:
     * ensure high-quality safe food and other agricultural products;
       assess the nutritional needs of Americans
     * sustain a competitive agricultural economy; enhance the natural
       resource base and the environment, and
     * provide economic opportunities for rural citizens, communities, and
       society as a whole.

    Research in the Beltsville Area addresses all of these goals through
                                 programs in
     * the Animal & Natural Resources Institute
     * the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center
