                    Center for Cryptologic History Emblem

   The art and science of cryptology has driven the work of NSA since its
   inception. The Center for Cryptologic History (CCH) is responsible for
   NSA's Cryptologic History Program, the object of which is to preserve
   the institutional memory of NSA and to document the role of cryptology
   in American history.

   The CCH has produced many informative publications about American
   cryptologic history. It has also gathered significant original
   documents from the VENONA project and the Cuban Missile Crisis which
   have been declassified and released. The Center holds a biennial
   symposium on Cryptologic History, inviting academia and historians to
   present papers and panels on a wide range of cryptologic history
   topics.

   Cryptology has always been part of the fight to preserve freedom. One
   of the most inspiring stories is the creation of slave quilts in the
   early and mid-1800s. Secret messages embedded in the quilts assisted
   slaves from the South in their efforts to escape to freedom in the
   North.   Also see African-American Cryptologists
