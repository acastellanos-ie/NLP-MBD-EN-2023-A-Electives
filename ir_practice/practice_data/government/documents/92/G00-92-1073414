                          Cybernetics and Systems Theory


   The following links provide general background information on the field
   of Cybernetics and Systems Theory, an interdisciplinary academic
   domain.
     __________________________________________________________________

      This material was collected and is provided in the context of the
      Principia Cybernetica Project, but can be consulted independently of
      the rest of the project. Although there are relatively few research
      centers and even fewer educational programs devoted to the domain, a
      lot of activity is going on in between established departments. This is
      shown by the number of associations, conferences and journals active in
      the domain.

      The best way of getting acquainted with the main ideas of cybernetics
      and systems theory is to read a few of the classic books or papers
      defining the domain. Some of these books are freely available through
      our Principia Cybernetica library. Other, specific bibliographic
      references can be found in the [externallink.GIF] library database of
      the Department of Medical Cybernetics and AI at the University of
      Vienna. There also exists more general reference material, including
      our own Web Dictionary of basic concepts.

      You can get in touch with cybernetics and systems people via existing
      mailing lists and newsgroups, personal or departmental home pages, or
      by visiting conferences in the field (see the list of
      [externallink.GIF] future conferences from the ASC and
      [externallink.GIF] Calendar of events from the [externallink.GIF]
      International Federation of Systems Research).
