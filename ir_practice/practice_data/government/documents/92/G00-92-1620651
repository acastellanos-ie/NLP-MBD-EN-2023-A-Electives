Basic Science

   Basic Science seeks solutions to a wide variety of scientific
   challenges. This includes experimental and theoretical work in
   materials science, physics, chemistry, biology, high-energy physics,
   and mathematics and computer science, including high-performance
   computing. Argonne's exciting, cutting-edge research brings value to
   society today by helping lay the foundation for tomorrow's
   technological breakthroughs.

Energy Resources

   Energy Resources programs help insure a reliable supply of efficient
   and clean energy for the future. Argonne scientists and engineers are
   developing advanced batteries and fuel cells, as well as advanced
   electric power generation and storage systems. Argonne's long history
   of research and development in nuclear reactor technology is now being
   applied to improving the safety and longevity of both American and
   Soviet-designed nuclear reactors.

Environmental Management

   Environmental Management includes work on managing and solving the
   nation's environmental problems and promoting environmental
   stewardship. Research in this area includes alternative energy systems;
   environmental risk and economic impact assessments; hazardous waste
   site analysis and remediation planning; electrometallurgical treatment
   to prepare spent nuclear fuel for disposal; and new technologies for
   decontaminating and decommissioning aging nuclear reactors.

Scientific Facilities

   Argonne designs, builds and operates many scientific and engineering
   research facilities and makes them available to outside researchers
   from industry, academia and other government laboratories. Three of
   these facilities -- the Advanced Photon Source, the Intense Pulsed
   Neutron Source and the Argonne Tandem-Linac Accelerator System -- are
   official U.S. Department of Energy National User Facilities. Operated
   as national scientific resources, these facilities are sophisticated
   research machines that would be too expensive for a single company or
   university to build and operate. Under some circumstances, such as when
   research results will be published in the open literature, researchers
   may be able to use these facilities without charge. When results are to
   be kept proprietary, a fee is generally charged for their use based on
   the recovery of operating costs.

   Argonne has many other laboratories and research facilities that are
   also open to outside researchers from industry, academia and other
   national laboratories for a cost-recovery-based fee. On a negotiated
   basis, research results may be kept proprietary or published in the
   open literature at the user's discretion.

   If you are interested in arranging research at one of the facilities on
   this list, but there is no live link or point of contact listed for
   further information, please send email to Argonne's Office of
   Technology Transfer or visit their home page.
