   Privacy and Security Statement

Privacy and Security Statement

   Thank you for visiting the Department of Labor (DOL) Website and
   reviewing our privacy and security statement. DOL is strongly committed
   to maintaining the privacy of your personal information and the
   security of our computer systems. With respect to the collection, use
   and disclosure of personal information, DOL makes every effort to
   ensure compliance with applicable Federal law, including, but not
   limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Paperwork Reduction Act of
   1995, and the Freedom of Information Act.

   As a general rule, the Department of Labor does not collect
   personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site,
   unless you choose to provide such information to us. The information we
   receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

   If you visit our site to read or download information, we collect and
   store the following information:

   The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
   example, dol.gov, if you are connecting from the Department of Labor's
   computer account).

   The date and time you access our site.

   The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to
   our site.

   The above information is used by software programs on our website to
   create summary statistics which allow us to assess the number of
   visitors to the different sections of our site, identify what
   information is of most and least interest, determine technical design
   specifications, monitor system performance, and help us make our site
   more useful to visitors.

   If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail containing personal
   information:

   You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information, for
   example your mailing address, in an electronic mail message requesting
   that information be mailed to you. Information collected in this manner
   is used solely for responding to requests for information or records.
   We may forward your E-mail to other Government employees who are better
   able to respond to you. Should you wish to file a request under FOIA,
   instructions are provided at:
   http://www.dol.gov/dol/public/foia/main.htm

   If you link to other sites outside DOL:

   Our Website has many links to other sites. When you link to any of
   these sites, you are no longer on our site and are subject to the
   privacy policy of the new site.

   Cookie Use Notice

   On a limited number of its web pages, the U.S. Department of Labor
   employs "cookies" to provide better service to its customers. The
   Department does not use cookies to collect any personally identifying
   information from users or to track user activities beyond our web site.
   The Department does not maintain copies of cookies on our web site
   after you leave our web site.

   Cookies are small pieces of temporary data that are exchanged between a
   web site and a user's computer which enable a "session", or "dialog",
   to be established between the two machines. With the session
   established, the Department is able to tailor its responses (i.e.,
   identify and provide you with the information you want) and help you
   traverse our web pages in the most efficient and effective manner
   possible. The session is often broken when the Department's server does
   not receive further requests from your computer or you simply exit your
   browser.

   The Department limits its use of cookies to "session cookies" types of
   cookies that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory. Session
   cookies are normally deleted from a user's computer when the user logs
   off the computer or the user exits the browser. As of January, 2001,
   the Department does not issue "persistent cookies"types of cookies that
   could be stored permanently on your workstation and reused each time
   you visit the Department's web site. Before January, 2001, however, the
   Department had a small number of web sites that automatically created
   persistent cookies. Those cookies may still be stored on some user's
   computers and, in some cases, may be updated by the user's browser when
   revisiting the DOL web site. In the event a cookie is found on your
   workstation which was issued from a Department of Labor web site, you
   may remove it without adversely affecting your future visits to our web
   site.
     __________________________________________________________________

   For security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available
   to all users, our website also employs software programs to monitor
   network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
   information, or otherwise cause damage.

   Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
   this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information
   Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.
