     Pepper Spray's Effects on a Suspect's Ability to Breathe (NIJ) (Dec.
   2001) (TXT or PDF) Oleoresin capsicum (OC), or pepper spray, has gained

   subdue violent and dangerous suspects in the field with relatively
   little force. However, it has been argued that OC spray, when used in
   combination with physical restraints, can lead to significant
   respiratory compromise, including asphyxiation and death. This Brief
   discusses the effect of OC on respiration, particularly when combined
   with positional restraint.
