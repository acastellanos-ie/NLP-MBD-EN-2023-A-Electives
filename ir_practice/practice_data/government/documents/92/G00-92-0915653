                              ISO 9001 Tutorial
                for the Space Science Data Operations Office

                              February 8, 2001
     __________________________________________________________________

   GSFC received its ISO Certification from Det Norske Veritas (DNV) on
   August 27, 1999 in "Science and Engineering Research and Development".
   Every six months, ISO surveillance audits are held. A surveillance
   audit is a check on the continued compliance of GSFC's Quality
   Management System (QMS) with ISO 9001 requirements.

   DNV will visit GSFC the week of February 12-15, 2001 for a surveillance
   audit.

   How Does ISO Affect Your Role Within Code 630?
   Space science data and documentation materials are the main products
       that the SSDOO delivers to its customer. Document 600-PG-8730.3.2
       defines Data Management procedures and guidelines. It defines
       Project Data Management Plans (PDMPs) as the mechanism to define
       what data and on what time scale it will be delivered to the
       National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC). These data are
       processed by the NSSDC Data Operations staff and made available via
       ftp-sites and/or via request services. The data sets have had
       Principal Investigator (PI) scrutiny before they are delivered to
       the NSSDC. Additionally, the data sets are initially examined by
       the Acquisition Scientist before the ingest pipeline goes into
       production. This science checking ensures the quality of the data
       sets. Data base entries are generated as the data are ingested into
       the Data Center Permanent Archive function and the Data
       Distribution function. These databases and metadata bases serve as
       the quality records for tracking our data. The NSSDC processes are
       documented in the "Space Science Data Operations Office (SSDOO)
       Standard Operating Procedures. Dr. Joseph King is the responsible
       government official for this document.
       The software and systems and data operations for the Data Center
       are managed by a Performance Based Contract (PBC). The government
       defines the requirements for the work along with performance
       metrics which objectively evaluate the performance. The government
       staff monitors the metrics, which serve as a quality record of the
       Data Center work. Additionally, the contractor maintains a Standard
       Operating Procedure for the data operations activities. The data
       archive and delivery systems' hardware and software are managed by
       an SSDOO Configuration Control Board (CCB). Action Requests are the
       mechanism for defining and evaluating work in this area.
       The Astrophysics Data Facility processes telemetry data into level
       0 data for its Principal investigators and Active Archives, e.g.
       the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archival Research Center
       (HEASARC). Its databases and metrics and on-line procedures ensure
       quality data is delivered.
       For the SSDOO staff who develop web pages and databases, these
       products are not products delivered to customers, and thus do not
       require quality records. However, be sure to use sound software
       development practices and configuration control so that your work
       is documented and organized for future maintenance. System
       administrator work would fall into this category as well.
       Document 600-PG-8730.3.1 is the Space Sciences Directorate
       Procedure and Guideline about Science Research. It says: "Science
       research is not amenable to detailed instruction, but is broadly
       guided by the scientific method. The scientific method is an
       integral part of advanced education in the physical sciences, so
       that peer review is the most appropriate mechanism to determine the
       extent to which research is being performed in accordance with its
       principles." Therefore, when you perform science research or
       acquisition scientist functions which require your scientific
       expertise, your scientific training, the scientific method, and
       peer review are adequate mechanisms to ensure quality science
       products. Some science PRODUCTS do fall under the scrutiny of ISO.
       Papers must be approved before submission for publication or
       presentation at a conference. Proposals likewise must be approved
       by management and by the resources staff. So there are associated
       procedures and quality records associated with these products.
       For the SSDOO staff who perform Education and Public Outreach
       activities, your science credentials allow you to work without
       requiring procedures and quality records.

   If You Do Science Research or Acquisition Scientist Roles
   When you perform science research or acquisition scientist functions
       which require your scientific expertise, your scientific training,
       the scientific method, and peer review are adequate mechanisms to
       ensure quality science products. Some science PRODUCTS do fall
       under the scrutiny of ISO. Papers must be approved before
       submission for publication or presentation at a conference.
       Proposals likewise must be approved by management and by the
       resources staff. So there are associated procedures and quality
       records associated with these products. Additionally, there are
       sound practices which are to be followed for interactions with
       outside data providers. Establishment of a Data Acquisition Folder
       is recommended. Significant interactions with data providers should
       be documented here. When possible, documentation should be
       finalized and saved in specific project locations and delivered to
       the cognizant manager or ATR.

   If You Create Data Center Value-Added Products, e.g. Data Sets, SSDOO
   Web Pages or Data Bases, or Provide Infrastructure Support
   For the SSDOO staff who develop web pages and databases, these products
       are not products delivered to customers, and thus do not require
       quality records. However, be sure to use sound software development
       practices and configuration control so that your work is documented
       and organized for future maintenance. System administrator work
       would fall into this category as well.

   Creating Your Own Working Document List
   For convenience, each GDMS user may create a customized "Working
       Document" list.
       This list is unique for each user, and can be accessed directly via
       a desktop "shortcut". Documents can be added to your list from the
       Directorate document library, the GPD/GPG library or the Master
       Document List. Alternatively, document numbers can be entered
       directly from the "My Working Documents" page. To enter documents
       from this page, you must enter the complete, properly formatted
       document number (e.g. 500-PG-8700.2.1 or GPG-1410.1).
       On the Library pages (and the Master Document List if you are
       logged in), documents can be added or deleted by clicking the "ADD
       to My List" link to the right of each document title.
       If there is no link, the document is already on your Working
       Document list.
       When you log in to the GDMS page, you can "Click Here to access
       Your Working Documents"

   Setting up an Icon on Your Desktop
   Desktop icons apply to Macs and PCs only. UNIX users will have to
       bookmark their Working Document List.
       One advantage to the Working Document List is that you will be
       automatically notified of GDMS document updates.
       Mac Users - Add a Bookmark to this page, then "Edit Bookmarks" and
       drag the bookmark to your desktop.
       PC Users - right-click on a blank area of this page and select
       "Create Shortcut" to create a shortcut back to this page.
       The desktop icon/shortcut will work even if you are NOT logged in
       to GDMS

   Audit Etiquette
   - Be familiar with the GSFC quality policy and how your work relates to
       it (in your own words is OK)
       - Know how you help GSFC meet its goals
       - Know where to locate GPG's, PG's, and WI's
       - Know what procedures and instructions are applicable to what you
       do
       - Convince the auditor you follow applicable procedures and
       instructions
       - Be professional, courteous and cooperative
       - Think before answering
       - Answer truthfully - If you don't know the answer don't be afraid
       to say "I don't know, but I'll find out"
       - Answer concisely
       - Take pride and responsibility for your work
       - Check with your supervisor if you are unsure about a sensitive
       issue
       - Explain terms and concepts (since terms may have a specific
       meaning here and a different meaning elsewhere
       - Don't make the auditor wait
       - Don't answer for work that is not your responsibility. If it is
       not your responsibility, say so.
       - Don't use acronyms or terms without explanation.
       - Don't think your answers don't count
       - Don't volunteer information not asked for
       - Don't act like the auditor is wasting your time
       - Don't guess or bluff
       - Don't criticize co-workers or the Center
       - Don't argue with the auditor
       - Don't say you don't follow the procedures because you "don't have
       the time" or it can't be done that way.

   Common Audit Questions (adapted from Code 450)
   Are you familiar with GSFC's quality policy?

   - Yes! You must be able to describe it in your own words.

   How does the quality policy relate to your work?
   - Describe how your job supports the customer-focused intent of
       excellence and meeting or exceeding customer requirements.

   Tell me what you do.
   - Briefly list your primary activities, and know how ISO applies to
       your work.

   How do you know how to do your job?
   - Answer with one or more of the following: Procedures (point to them),
       training, or education/experience.

   Which GPGs, PGs and WIs apply to your work?
   - Know what procedures apply to your work. Be able to bring up the GSFC
       Directives Management System (GDMS). It is advisable to have an
       icon on your desktop with your applicable GPGs, PGs and WIs.

   How do you document your work?
   - Name the Quality Records (QRs) that apply to your work. It is OK to
       refer to the Quality Records List (QRL) for your organization.

   May I see your quality records?
   - Visit QRL Coordinator and refer to Quality Records List (QRL). If you
       are the QR Custodian, you should be able to show the auditor your
       file(s) of QRs.

   How do you know that this is the correct version of this procedure?
   - The only correct version is on-line in the GDMS.

   How do you do document nonconformances?
   - The NCR/CA system is used to document nonconformances and customer
       complaints with in-scope work. It can also be used to document
       purchasing nonconformances, such as bad batches of disks or media.

   May I see the NCR/CA records?
   - Be able to bring up the NCR/CA system, and to demonstrate how a
       nonconformance would be entered. Also know your NCR/CA Leads.

   600 - Roger Dilling
       630 - Nancy Laubenthal
       631 - Michael Van Steenberg
       660 - Andy Dantzler
       663 - Andy Dantzler
       680 - Ed Sullivan
       690 - Frank Ottens

   Who is your customer for your in-scope work?
   - GSFC is the supplier. HQ, collaborators, the science community, the
       general public and the education community are usually our
       customers.

   How do you ensure that contractors meet your quality requirements?
   - Identify how contractors are evaluated, or refer the auditor to the
       appropriate person or organization.
