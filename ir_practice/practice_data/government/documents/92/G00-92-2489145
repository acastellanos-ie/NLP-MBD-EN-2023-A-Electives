   The Jamaican police are once again being praised for their contribution
   in helping the U.S. in crimefighting, following the capture of Wayne
   Davis, a U.S. fugitive who had been on the run for the last 14 years.
   Director Ben Reyna of the United States Marshals Service says "Davis'
   capture is an excellent example of a cooperative law enforcement
   effort." (Above: J'can Narcotics Chief, Carl Williams recently
