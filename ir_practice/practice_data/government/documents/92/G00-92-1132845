   Please Read the NOAA Privacy Disclaimer Here.

     The Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA), located in
     Silver Spring, Maryland, conducts research monitoring, surveys and
      assessments of coastal environmental quality. CCMA's considerable
      expertise includes NOAA's National Status and Trends Program, the
    Biogeography Program and the Physical Environmental Characterization
   Program. These programs bring extensive national databases, Geographic
      Information Systems (GIS), coastal assessments, and more than 700
      books, atlases, journal articles, and agency technical memoranda
   published on coastal monitoring and assessment to CCMA. This expertise
   and information supports NOAA's coastal stewardship role in sustaining
     healthy coasts, providing safe navigation, and supporting fisheries
      management (e.g., the determination of essential fish habitats).

   CCMA is part of the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS),
      which conducts and supports monitoring, research, assessment, and
      technical assistance for the range of NOAA's coastal stewardship
                              responsibilities.
