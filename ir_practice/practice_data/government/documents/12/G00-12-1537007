   The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National
   Laboratory is a world-class scientific research facility that began
   operation in 2000, following 10 years of development and construction.
   Hundreds of physicists from around the world use RHIC to study what the
   universe may have looked like in the first few moments after its
   creation. RHIC drives two intersecting beams of gold ions head-on, in a
   subatomic collision. What physicists learn from these collisions may
   help us understand more about why the physical world works the way it
   does, from the smallest subatomic particles, to the largest stars.
