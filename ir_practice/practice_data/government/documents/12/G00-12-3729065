      Welcome to the Military & Base Reuse section of the California Economic
      Diversification and Revitalization (CEDAR) website. CEDAR's goals are
      to organize and disseminate electronic information to assist California
      citizens, businesses and communities to successfully transition from
      military and defense work to compete in the global economy.

      The California Trade and Commerce Agency is the state's central
      clearinghouse for all base reuse and defense conversion activities.
      Three current and comprehensive reports on California base closure,
      reuse, realignment and the active military in the state are the
      California Military Base Closures: Current Status of Reuse Efforts, the
      California Base Closure News and the Brief Descriptive Profiles of
      Selected Major California Military Installations (active bases). The
      most recent discussion of pertinent national policy is the Department
      of Defense Base Reuse Implementation Manual.

   Base Reuse Policy, Law and Guidance
          OECI is a collaborative initiative of the U.S. Department of
          Commerce and the Department of Defense. OECI is a free service
          that provides information about defense adjustment and defense
          conversion, economic development and technology transfer. Their
          database contains a compendium of government programs and a host
          of other materials designed to assist businesses, communities
          and workers affected by defense budget cutbacks and other
          economic development challenges.

   California Military and Base Reuse
          Ensuring that new development will be provided with adequate
          infrastructure and services is a primary consideration of local
          government. A Planner's Guide to Financing Public Improvements
          describes current statutory financing options available to
          California communities. Its primary purpose is to provide city
          and county planners with a general discussion of methods of
          public works financing that do not rely on state funds. In
          addition, it illustrates some local innovations that are
          currently in use.

   Conferences, Events, and Meetings on Base Reuse (Limited Calendar)

   Federal and State Environmental Issues
          The U.S. Army Environmental Center (USAEC) is a major focal
          point in the program management and support efforts of the
          Army-wide environmental program. The USAEC's mission includes
          centralized management, oversight, coordination, and execution
          of Army environmental programs. This Internet site contains
          information on environmental program contacts, publications,
          announcements, press releases and sources for additional
          information.

   Federal and State Funding Opportunities on Base Reuse
          Project grants offer funding for research focused on the
          development of products/information to reduce earthquake
          hazards. The objective of the program is to mitigate earthquake
          losses, provide earth science data and assessments essential for
          warning purposes, land use planning, engineering design, and
          emergency preparedness decisions.

   Reports and Newsletters
          For hazardous waste sites added in 1996 to the Environmental
          Protection Agency's (EPA) register of the nation's most
          contaminated locations, EPA took on average more than nine years
          to complete the process--from site discovery to final listing on
          the National Priorities List. This testimony addresses issues
          relating to the lengthening time lines for hazardous waste site
          cleanup.

   Technical Assistance Resources and Contacts on Base Reuse
          This site provides information about congressional activities, a
          congressional directory, information about the legislative
          process, and e-mail links to members of Congress.
