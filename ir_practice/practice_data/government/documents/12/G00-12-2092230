   Characteristics Primary interface considerations for the use of MCMs
   with MFS are the electrical interconnects and the thermal interface.
   These are linked in various MCM packages because some lead styles are
   in the normal-thermal path through the base of the package. Electrical
   interconnects fall into four categories: leaded packages, pin grids,
   ball grids Figure 2. Multifunctional Structures Experiment (and column
