                              FITS Data Format

   FITS stands for `Flexible Image Transport System' and is the standard
   astronomical data format endorsed by both NASA and the IAU. FITS is
   much more than an image format (such as JPG or GIF) and is primarily
   designed to store scientific data sets consisting of multi-dimensional
   arrays (1-D spectra, 2-D images or 3-D data cubes) and 2-dimensional
   tables containing rows and columns of data.

   The following index lists major sources of FITS information. Send
   updates to this list to W Pence.

Reference Documents
