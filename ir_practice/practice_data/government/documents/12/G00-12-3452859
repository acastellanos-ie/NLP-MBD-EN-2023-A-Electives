    MH2000 PROCEEDINGS PUBLISHED
    The Proceedings of MH2000 (Noosa, Australia) have been published as
    Volumes 330-332 of the JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS (2002, Elsevier
    Science, http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/jnlnr/06012). The new hydride
    papers contained therein have not yet been added to any of our
    databases, but will be during calendar year 2002.

   This site provides access to a comprehensive set of databases on
   metal-hydrogen systems, their properties, applications and literature
   sources, as well as profiles of organizations involved in
   metal-hydrogen development. A listing of current meetings of interest
   to the M-H community is also included. This effort is funded by the
   U.S. Department of Energy as a contribution to the International Energy
   Agency Hydrogen Implementing Agreement. A profile of IEA collaborative
   R&D activities can be found in IEA Task 17. We wish to express our
   gratitude to the IEA, U.S. DOE and Sandia National Laboratories for the
   support and interest provided for this data collection and
   dissemination effort. We also acknowledge the compliments and
   encouragement of many past users of the Hydride Databases. Finally, we
   are grateful for the help of many of the authors cited for directing us
   to errors and publications we missed.
   The Databases are made freely available to anyone interested. There are
   no copyright restrictions to the lists generated; however, those who
   use this database are requested to kindly cite it in any resultant
   reports or publications
   All databases must be used with care and in conjunction with the
   original references cited so you can make your own judgments as to the
   data reliability before using that data for any purposes. The
   introductory page for each database used should be carefully read to
   help understand the nature of the data presented.

        We believe the information presented is a reasonably accurate
   representation of the data published; however, the International Energy
       Agency, U.S. DOE and Sandia National Laboratories can offer no
    warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy, applicability or
