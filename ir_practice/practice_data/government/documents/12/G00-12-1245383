   Student Programs

   Welcome to the home page for the Argonne National Laboratory-West
   Student Programs. From here you can learn more information about the
   research activities and student employment opportunities available at
   ANL-West. Starting in December, applications will be accepted for our
   2002 summer program. This program is primarily aimed at undergraduates.
   We are, however, looking for top graduate students year round for
   collaborative research projects with universities

   About ANL-West.

   Argonne National Laboratory-West is part of Argonne National Laboratory
   and is operated by the University of Chicago for the Department of
   Energy. Our distinguished history of fast reactor development has
   provided the foundation for our work addressing a host of current
   Department of Energy challenges such as the nuclear fuel cycle past and
   present, waste management, environmental technology, safeguards
   technologies and nonproliferation.
