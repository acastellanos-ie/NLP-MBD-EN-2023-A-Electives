   Our researchers are using holograms to "see" how materials react at the
   moment they begin to break apart. This glass plate holds a tiny portion
   of the particles and images needed to create a scientific hologram.
   DOE Nevada comprises the Nevada Test Site and its related laboratories
   and facilities in California, Maryland, Nevada, and New Mexico. Bechtel
   Nevada manages and operates the work at the test site and its related
   facilities for the U.S. Department of Energy Nevada Operations Office.
   Bechtel Nevada is a consortium of three companies: Bechtel Nevada
   Corporation; Johnson Controls Nevada, Inc.; and Lockheed Martin Nevada
   Technologies, Inc.

   We have a cadre of architectural engineers, construction professionals,
   craftsmen, engineers, miners, nuclear physicists, scientists,
   technicians, and other professionals. We have many technologies and
   skills. Our people are experts in developing specialized sensors and
   sensor systems, instrumentation and high-speed recording systems, data
   analysis, and data communications. We have more than 40 years
   experience mining underground tunnels and drilling some of the world's
   deepest, widest shafts.

   Our professionals also perform aerial radiation and environmental
   surveys of government sites, industrial nuclear power plants, and
   mining sites around the world to measure the levels of background and
   man-made radiation near the areas. We are part of the Department of
   Energy's nuclear emergency response program, and our people play a
   vital role in America's ability to respond to a wide range of nuclear
   emergencies.

   Our people can take the lead on a project, or they can serve as part of
   an integrated, multifaceted team. We do whatever it takes to get the
   job done right. And we go wherever we're needed, whether it's in the
   frigid Arctic Circle, behind the fallen Iron Curtain, or in the parched
   Nevada desert. We fill technological niches by finding distinctive and
   creative solutions that solve difficult technical problems.
