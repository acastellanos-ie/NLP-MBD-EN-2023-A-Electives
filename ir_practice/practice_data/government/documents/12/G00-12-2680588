    USAID Administrator Andrew S. Natsios arrived in Cairo on January 15
   for a three-day visit. The purpose of the visit is to meet with senior
        government officials and private sector and non-governmental
   organization leaders in support of Egypt's ongoing development efforts.

    For more than 25 years, the United States and Egypt have collaborated
   closely as partners in economic development and regional stability. All
    sectors of the economy have benefited from the cooperative efforts of
    the two countries and from the $24.7 billion in assistance resources
                  that have been devoted to these efforts.

   Today, Egypt has a growing market-oriented economy and a healthier and
      more educated population. The country enjoys more productive and
      efficient agriculture, cleaner water for its people, and advanced
    electrical and telecommunications facilities. In addition, Egypt has
     enormous potential as both a market for U.S. commodities and as an
                  investment location for U.S. businesses.

   The United States remains deeply committed to Egypt's development goals
   and to the partnership of our two countries as our relationship evolves
    from one based on aid to one focused on mutual trade and investment.
