                     The KSC Spaceport Technology Center

   Inside Control Tower (Image) Kennedy Space Center at the Cape Canaveral
   Spaceport is NASAÂ’s Spaceport Technology Center, a world-class resource
   for the emerging space transportation industry.

   Rockets first lifted off from Cape Canaveral 50 years ago. Today no
   other site in the world processes and launches as many different types
   of manned and unmanned space vehicles. The KSC team and the U.S. Air
   Force's 45th Space Wing also process a wide variety of government and
   commercial payloads.

   As a partner in the world's premier launch site, KSC is helping to set
   the standard for future spaceports. KSC recently contributed its
   expertise in spaceport technology to the development of the new rocket
   launch site on Kodiak Island, Alaska.

   Although today's commercial launch industry is focused on launching
   rockets carrying multi-million dollar communications satellites, the
   future will bring a greater need for commercial space transportation.

   In the coming decades, space flight will become so affordable that
   industry will be able to take advantage of it for research and
   manufacture, international deliveries, business travel and even
   tourism.

   One day, tourists will come to Florida not just to take cruises, but to
   take a ride on a space plane to a hotel orbiting the Earth.

   Visionary approaches and strategies being taken today at KSC are laying
   the groundwork for the Cape Canaveral Spaceport of the future. We want
   to continue to offer safe and cost-effective space access for our
   nation and international partner's needs.
