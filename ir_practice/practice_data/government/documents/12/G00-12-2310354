   The Criminal Law Division is the largest segment of the Office of
   Attorney General, representing more than half of all employees.

   The attorneys within the Criminal Law Division are organized into three
   areas:
   [bullet.jpg] General Prosecutions;
   [bullet.jpg] Organized Crime and Narcotics;
   [bullet.jpg] Law and Appeals.

   General Prosecutions is further broken down in the following four
   sections:
   [bullet.jpg] Criminal Prosecutions Section;
   [bullet.jpg] Environmental Crimes Section;
   [bullet.jpg] Insurance Fraud Section;
   [bullet.jpg] Medicaid Fraud Control Section.

   Likewise, Organized Crime and Narcotics is comprised of three sections:
   [bullet.jpg] Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section;
   [bullet.jpg] Drug Strike Force Section;
   [bullet.jpg] Organized Crime Section.
   Law and Appeals is comprised of these three sections:
   [bullet.jpg] Appeals and Legal Services Section;
   [bullet.jpg] Computer Forensics Section;
   [bullet.jpg] Regulatory Compliance and Intelligence Section.

   By law, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General has the power to
   investigate and prosecute criminal matters relating to the public
   duties of state officials and employees, corrupt organizations, charges
   referred by a Commonwealth agency pursuant to such agency's enforcement
   provisions, presentments returned by an investigating grand jury, and
   matters arising out of the Medicaid Fraud Control Section. In addition,
   the Criminal Law Division may prosecute upon request of a district
   attorney and may handle criminal appeals as the law provides.

   The Commonwealth Attorneys Act provides that the Attorney General shall
   have the power to investigate any criminal offense which he has the
   power to
   prosecute. Therefore, the Office of Investigations constitutes a large
   component of the Criminal Law Division.
