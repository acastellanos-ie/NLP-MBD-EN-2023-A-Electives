   NIH scientists are deeply committed to research training and for
   decades have informally accepted graduate students from domestic and
   international universities into their laboratories and have guided
   their dissertation research.

   If you are an undergraduate or graduate student interested in
   performing your dissertation research in the NIH Intramural Research
   Program laboratories, please view the web-pages applicable to you.
