   Laboratory of Genomic Diversity


   The strength of the LGD is in the cooperative interplay of diverse
   skills and interests of its scientists, who are encouraged to pursue
   different lines of investigation, ranging from fundamental genetic
   mechanisms to approaches that  hopefully will be directly applicable to
   the understanding.
