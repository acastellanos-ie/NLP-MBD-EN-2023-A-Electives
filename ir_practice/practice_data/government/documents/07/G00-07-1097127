   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) established the National Spent
   Nuclear Fuel Program to support its need to safely and efficiently
   manage all DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel and prepare it for disposal.
   The National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program is addressing that need. Our
   mission is to provide technology solutions and guidance to ensure safe,
   efficient handling, characterization, and disposition of DOE-owned or
   managed spent nuclear fuel.

   We are currently performing analyses and providing technology solutions
   in four distinct areas of spent nuclear fuel management. Projects
   related to the following focus areas can be found in our fact sheets:
     * Solutions for safe, efficient packaging and transportation
     * Solutions for safe, interim and long-term storage
     * Solutions for accurate characterization
     * Compliance with safety and regulatory requirements
