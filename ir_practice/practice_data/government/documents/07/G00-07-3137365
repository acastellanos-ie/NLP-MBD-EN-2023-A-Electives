                    Single Photon Detector and 3D Imaging

   Remote Ultra-Low Light Imaging (RULLI) is a sensor system technology
   enabling breakthroughs in many application arenas. The core of the
   technology is a single-photon detection system. The RULLI sensor system
   measures, accurately and simultaneously, the position and absolute time
   of arrival for each detected photon. This opens up many new
   possibilities for the exploitation of this literally three dimensional
   data. This Los Alamos technology project is funded by the US Department
   of Energy.

                                    Technology

   The RULLI technology consists of three primary components: the
   MicroChannel Plate/Crossed Delay Line (MCP/CDL) detector, the Pulse
   Absolute Timing (PAT) electronics, and associated photon event
   construction and data processing techniques.

   Sensor: The MCP/CDL detector is a hermetically sealed vacuum tube which
   contains the light sensing material (photocathode) on the backside of
   the transparent window, a Z-stack of three microchannel plates, and a
   crossed delay line readout. It offers a high signal read-out rate and
   good spatial resolution. To date, we have implemented a series of
   detectors each using a 40 mm diameter MCP (which defines the detector's
   active area) and an S-20 photocathode which is sensitive in the visible
   regime.

   [tim_small_pic.gif] Electronics: The PAT electronics is a fast and
   accurate timing technology with heritage from the nuclear test program
   at Los Alamos. The PAT system measures the absolute arrival time of
   individual electrical pulses with an accuracy better than 20
   picoseconds.

   [roads_small_pic.gif] Data Exploitation: The combination of MCP/CDL and
   PAT allows us to acquire single photons with high spatial and time
   resolution. Spatial resolution at the detector's active surface is
   projected to be 30 microns. The absolute timing accuracy achieved to
   date is 200 ps. The projected maximum count rate is about 2 million
   counts/sec. In addition, we are developing critical customized and
   optimized data processing techniques, information extraction
   algorithms, and visualization methods to exploit the data and
   information generated by the RULLI sensor system.

                                   Applications

   RULLI is a relatively mature technology. We have demonstrated a number
   of applications under various field operation scenarios. Here are some
   examples of actual data and generic applications.
   [iceplants.gif] Low Noise High Sensitivity Imaging: This is an image
   taken from an airborne moving platform under moonless overcast
   conditions. Using the timing information, we were able to apply post-
   facto motion compensation, geo-register each photon to the target
   scene, and construct this image. This 150x150 image covers an area of
   60 m square. It contains about 205K detected photons, with 9 counts per
   pixel on average. Even with such low statistics, features in the
   vegetation-covered (ice plant) scene are easily discerned.

   [slanl-031.gif] High Precision Topographical Mapping: This image shows
   the topography of a solid target measured in the laboratory. A very
   low-power pulsed laser was used to illuminate the target. The letters
   LANL were carved out of 2-inch thick Styrofoam block and attached to a
   solid piece of the same type of Styrofoam. A total of 280K photons are
   used to derive this topographical map. This image demonstrates the
   RULLI system's capability of remotely measuring precise topography from
   a single vantage point with no moving parts.

   [tree0-201.gif] Probing Complex 3D Structures: This image displays a 2D
   projection of the three dimensional distribution of detected photons
   reflected from a Ponderosa pine. The pine tree was illuminated from a
   distance with a low-power pulsed laser which was colocated with the
   stationary sensor. The data is contained in a cubical volume with 13 m
   on the side. The blue square defines the viewing direction into the
   data volume. A total of 2.8 million photons is contained in this
   volume. Detailed complex structure of the tree is clearly revealed by
   this measurement.

   The salient features of the RULLI sensor system are as follows: single
   photon sensitivity, extremely low noise, ambient temperature operation,
   and non-pixellated contiguous imaging area. Specific advantages of the
   RULLI system's application to 3D imaging are: large area and
   simultaneous coverage, no moving parts, and low illumination power
   requirement.

   Los Alamos, in collaboration with other institutions, is actively
   improving all aspects of the RULLI technology, exploring new single
   photon sensor concepts, and developing applications that take full
   advantage of this unique three dimensional sensor capability. For more
   technical information on RULLI and related technologies, contact Dr.
   Cheng Ho at ho@lanl.gov.
