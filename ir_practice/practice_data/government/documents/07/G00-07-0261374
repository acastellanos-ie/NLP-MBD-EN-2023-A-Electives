               Welcome to the LANL P-25 neutrino group homepage.

   We are part of the P25 group at the Los Alamos National Lab (LANL).
   Please find here links to our current projects and other relevant
   items.

   The LSND (Liquid Scintillation Neutrino Detector) experiment searches
   for neutrino oscillations and explores other aspects of particle and
   nuclear physics. The experiment utilizes a beam of neutrinos from the
   LANSCE accelerator (formerly known as LAMPF).

   The BooNE experiment is a follow-up experiment to LSND that has a main
   goal of confirming (or refuting) the evidence of neutrino oscillations
   reported by LSND.
