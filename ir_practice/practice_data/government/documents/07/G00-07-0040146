   Concerned about identity theft?
   When someone steals your personal information and uses it to establish
   credit or other accounts in your name, youre a victim of identity
   theft. National Consumer Protection Week, February 3 - 9, is a good
   time to find out what's being done to protect you from this
   fast-growing crime.

   Protect yourself from vision loss
   People who have Medicare Part B (medical insurance) are now eligible
   for glaucoma screening once every 12 months. Glaucoma is the leading
   cause of blindness in African-Americans and in all adults in their
   sixties or older. If untreated, glaucoma can cause irreversible loss of
   vision. It's estimated that in the United States, about half of the
   people with glaucoma don't know they have the condition. For more
   information about Medicare visit www.medicare.gov or call
   1-800-MEDICARE.

   Apply to retire online
   If you're 62 or older, you can apply online for Social Security
   retirement or spouse's benefits. It's quick and easy, and the
   information you give us will be secure.

   SSA's FAIR Act Inventory
   We're required by the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act to
   inventory the activities our employees perform that could be considered
   commercial, and to share it with you. Here's our 2001 inventory.

   Ticket to Work On December 28, 2001, SSA published final regulations
   implementing the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program. This new
   program provides beneficiaries with disabilities with expanded options
   for access to employment services, vocational rehabilitation services,
   or other support services. These regulations are effective January 28,
   2002.
   See the text of the final regulations . Find here more information
   about the new Ticket to Work Program.

   If you requested a Social Security Statement in December or late
   November, it may take you a little longer than usual to get it. Because
   of a contractor change, Statements requested during this period wont
   be issued until January. Were sorry if this causes you any
   inconvenience.

   Schools Officials Certifying Student Attendance Just Got Easier
   We're lightening the load for school officials who certify attendance
   for students receiving Social Security benefits. A new website explains
   the improved process and puts at their fingertips all the information
   school officials need.

   SSA has released its Performance and Accountability Report for FY 2001.
   This report includes full disclosure of SSA's financial and program
   operations for the past year.

   place, Representing Clients . You'll find information on fee
