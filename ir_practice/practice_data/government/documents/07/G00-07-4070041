   Welcome to the Satellite Situation Center (SSCWeb) System and Services

   The Satellite Situation Center Web (SSCWeb) service has been developed
   and is operated jointly by the NASA/GSFC Space Physics Data Facility
   (SPDF) and the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) to support a
   range of NASA science programs and to fulfill key international NASA
   responsibilities including those of NSSDC and the World Data Center-A
   for Rockets and Satellites.

   The software and associated database of SSCWeb together form a system
   to cast geocentric spacecraft location information into a framework of
   (empirical) geophysical regions and mappings of spacecraft locations
   along lines of the Earth's magnetic field. This capability is one key
   to mission science planning (both single missions and coordinated
   observations of multiple spacecraft with ground-based investigations)
   and to subsequent multi-mission data analysis. This system directly
   supports the operational SSC and ISTP's Science Planning and Operations
   Facility (SPOF).

The Satellite Situation Center Concept

   The SSC is a facility operated by NSSDC to fulfill key international
   responsibilities such as the SpaceWarn bulletins and to assist users in
   a particular magnetospheric region, allow a choice from a variety of
   internal and external magnetic field models for field-line tracing
   options, plot spacecraft trajectories, and perform conversions among
   geocentric and magnetic coordinate systems. magnetic coordinate
   systems. The SSC and NSSDC also support a set of pages for heliospheric
   spacecraft, planet and comet trajectories and pages for specific access
   to various space physics models including IGRF/DGRF and CGM coordinate
   transformations. The SSC also maintains a set of useful processed
   products and information.

   We've tried to make SSCWeb as self explanatory as possible. However,
   you may still have some questions so we recommend reading the
   "Navigation Tips" before using it.

                            Locator Graphics NEW!

   The Locator graphics component provides the ability to plot the orbits
   of multiple spacecraft. In addition to orbit plots, mapped and time
   series plots can also be generated.

                               Locator Tabular

   The Locator component provides tabular information. As tabular output,
   the spacecraft's coordinate location can be listed in a variety of
   coordinate systems, as well as other location related items.

   Query

   The Query component provides two query matching options: magnetospheric
   region occupancy and magnetic field line tracing.

   The region query lists the entry and exit times during which specified
   satellite(s) were in particular magnetospheric regions. The trace query
   identifies periods when one or more spacecraft are on the same magnetic
   flux tube of force, or periods when one or more spacecraft occupy a
   field line which traces down to a specified ground station.

   Query Tutorial

   Note: Access to the older SSC System Version 2.2 interface has now been
   completely discontinued. Please use our primary SSCWeb interface above

  Users of Locator Graphics

   The Locator Graphics is a new capability and as such you may experience
   some problems. Requests for plots of long time periods will probably
   result in your browser timing out before the plot is complete and also
   ties up the server so that others can not use the system. Please try to
   keep the requested time period as short as possible. If you really need
   to make plots for long time periods please contact the SSC about a
   facilities account, which will allow you to submit requests in batch
   mode. If you encounter any problems please report it to the SSC and we
   will try to solve the problem as soon as possible. Thank you for your
   cooperation.

SSCWeb Facilities Interface

   In addition to the interface above the Satellite Situation Center
   provides limited access to an extended interface that permits users to
   make Locator and Query runs in a batch mode and save queries on the
   host. Other than these additional capabilities the interface is exactly
   the same as the public interface. If you would like access to this
   facilities interface please send e-mail to ssc@sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov.
