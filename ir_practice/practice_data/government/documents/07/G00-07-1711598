    Throughout the social sciences, the simulation of social agents has
   emerged as an innovative and powerful research methodology.  The
   promise of
   this approach, however, is accompanied by numerous challenges.  First,
   modeling complexity in agents, environments and interactions is
   non-trivial,
   and these complex representations must to be explored and assessed
   systematically.  In addition, strategies used to represent such
   complexities
   will be differentially applicable to any particular problem space.
   Finally,
   in order to achieve sufficient generality, the design and
   experimentation
   inherent in agent simulation will need to be coupled with social and
   behavioral theory.  To realize the potential of agent methodologies,
   researchers will need to find ways to resolve these challenges.

   will provide a forum in which to review the current state of agent
   simulation scholarship, including research designed to address such
   outstanding issues.  Workshop papers will be presented on Friday,
   October
   11th and Saturday, October 12th.

   Sponsored by the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory.
