               "Not only does God play dice with the Universe,
             he sometimes casts them where they can't be seen."
                               Stephen Hawking

   Who among us has not asked, "Where did I come from?" This question is
   usually one about life, but behind it are scientific questions about
   the material of which we are made, the atoms and molecules of our
   bodies. The answer to the question "Where did the matter we are made of
   come from?" is not so easy to find. There is a whole series of related
   questions that are involved in understanding the cycles that matter
   goes through as the universe and the structures within it evolve.

              Why is it so hard to figure out what's going on?

   The Cosmic and Heliospheric Learning Center, brought to you by the
   cosmic ray group at NASA GSFC, is designed to increase your interest in
   cosmic and heliospheric science. (The heliosphere is the HUGE area in
   space affected by the Sun.) It's an exciting subject to learn about and
   is a robust area of study.

   The Learning Center is aimed at the general public and intended to be
   accessible to interested readers without a background in this area of
   science.

   Please let us hear your suggestions on how we should grow.
