   An Introduction to JPL and TAP

   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a major national laboratory, with an
   obligation to serve society by providing significant technological
   innovations where our special skills can be a contribution. JPL
   technology research programs enrich the success of space missions.
   Besides this work for NASA, we also conduct a wide range of activities
   for other sponsoring organizations. The American public and U.S.
   industry greatly benefit from JPL developed technologies that are
   transferred into healthcare, the environment, education,
   communications, transportation, computers and other fields.
