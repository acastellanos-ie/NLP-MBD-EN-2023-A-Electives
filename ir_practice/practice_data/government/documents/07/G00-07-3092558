       September 11, 2001 attack USGS Open-File Report 01-0429
     * NWISWeb - National Water Information System Web Site. Selected
       water-resources data for approximately 1.5 million sites across the
       United States, selected territories and border locations, from 1857
       to present. Data are retrieved by category of data, such as surface
       water, ground water, or water quality; and by geographic area. Of
       the 1.5 million sites with data, 80% are wells; 350,000 are water
       quality sites; and 19,000 are streamflow sites, of which over 5,000
       are real-time. NWISWeb contains about 4.3 million water quality
       samples and 64 million water quality sampling results. New York
