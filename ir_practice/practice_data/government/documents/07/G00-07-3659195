   Earth and Environmental Sciences-11 (EES-11) is the Geophysics Group of
   Los Alamos National Laboratory. We work in seismic monitoring,
   characterization of underground structures and facilities, mining
   exploration and efficiency, and environmental characterization. We also
   conduct basic research into physical properties of earth materials, new
   seismic imaging methods using parallel computing, the interaction of
   fluids in pore space and wave excitation, the development of
   microborehole tools, study of reservoir microearthquakes, study of
   earthquake strong motion, and study of fluid flow in earth materials.
   Former work included hot dry rock geothermal development.
     * EES-11 has helped craft the Protocols to the Threshold Test Ban
       Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty and is now working
       as part of an integrated team under the US Department of Energy as
       part of the Nuclear Explosion Monitoring (NEM) Program

     * We are cooperating with the mining industry to develop methods of
       characterizing explosions used in mining, eventually leading to
       increased mining efficiency and reduced ground motion problems.
       Currently, we are working with SMU and Black Thunder Mine in the
       Powder River Basin of Wyoming and are looking for similar
       cooperative arrangements with other mines and universities.

     * Using remotely sensed data (imagery and exploration geophysical
       methods), EES-11 personnel have developed data integration
       techniques to identify and accurately locate areas that in the past
       were used for hazardous waste storage and disposal, greatly
       facilitating clean-up.
