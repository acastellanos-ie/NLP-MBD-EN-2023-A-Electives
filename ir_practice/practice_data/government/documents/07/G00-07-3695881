   JPL Sensor Webs Project

      A New Class of Instruments for Monitoring and Exploring Environments.

      Technology is continuously changing and improving at JPL. We encourage
      discovery of breakthroughs by identifying promising ideas and
      supporting their development. The JPL Sensor Webs Project is an example
      of a great idea growing into an innovative technology.

      The Sensor Web is an independent network of wireless,
      intra-communicating sensor pods, deployed to monitor and explore a
      limitless range of environments. This adaptable instrument can be
      tailored to whatever conditions it is sent to observe.
