   510.486.5501 voice, 510.486.6003 fax Working closely with colleagues in
   other LBNL divisions and elsewhere, we study and apply the physics of
   beamsbeams of ions, electrons, and lightand advance the related
   technologies. The results serve users worldwide in fields as diverse as
   cancer treatment and the quest for fusion energy.

   Whats New, July 9, 2001:
     * The AFRD Integrated Safety Management Plan is available; we
       encourage all employees to read it.
     * The Superconducting Magnet Group has set a new world record
       (again).

   Fusion Energy Research. What will we do when the fossil fuels run out?
   This program furthers the inertial fusion energy option, primarily
   through R&D on heavy-ion induction accelerators. It is part of a
   Virtual National Laboratory, headquartered in AFRD, that joins us
   with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Princeton Plasma
   Physics Laboratory in close collaboration on heavy-ion fusion.
   Aerial view of the Advanced Light Source Advanced Light Source
   Accelerator Physics. A commitment to provide synchrotron-light users
   with topnotch beams and the highest reliabilitytoday and in the
   futurecalls for extensive and imaginative R&D. Heres what were doing
   to keep this machine at the state of the art.
   Data from an Optical Transition Radiation experiment Center for Beam
   Physics. The poet Carl Sandburg writes, Nothing happens unless first a
   dream, which summarizes the way this group applies its theoretical and
   practical capabilities to AFRDs present needs while working toward
   possible future projects. Experiments with laser plasma acceleration,
   and with production of femtosecond x-ray pulses through Thomson
   scattering, are among its prominent recent achievements.
   End view of the record-setting D20 magnet Superconducting Magnets. The
   complete melt-to-magnet capabilities of this program (that is,
   everything from materials science through design, fabrication and
   testing of magnets) benefit both present and next-generation
   high-energy-physics projects. The program does basic research that is
   of generic relevance to the field and develops specific items for
   current projects like the Large Hadron Collider and future ones such as
   a muon collider.
   Macroparticles and the desired beam of carbon plasma take different
   paths through a twist filter Ion Beam Technology. This program applies
   AFRDs central legacyaccelerator science and technologyto problems as
   diverse as cancer treatment and computer-chip manufacturing. A major
   highlight is a front end for the Spallation Neutron Source that is
   being built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
   Cutaway of beam transport section of DARHT injector Projects take ideas
   and expertise from these R&D programs and turn them into facilities,
   using modern management approaches to ensure quality, timeliness, and
   cost containment. Presently they include the Large Hadron Collider at
   CERN, the second-axis accelerator of the Dual-Axis Radiographic
   Hydrotest facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Next
   Linear Collider being planned in collaboration with the Stanford Linear
   Accelerator Center. (This subpage under construction as the final part
   of the July 2000 revision cycle.)

Partners for Progress: AFRDs Organizational Context

   Within Berkeley Lab, AFRD works closely on technical matters and shares
   administrative support with two other organizations that depend on
   advanced accelerators: the Physics and Nuclear Science Divisions. An
   important contributor to the success of all three is the Engineering
   Division, a central resource for technological expertise at the
   Laboratory.
