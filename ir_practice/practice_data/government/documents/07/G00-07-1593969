   Welcome to Moult's Group Homepage.

      The principle focus of our group is the theoretical and applied
      computational analysis of biological systems. Our research interests
      include:
        * Ab Initio protein folding
        * Threading and comparative modeling algorithms
        * Bioinformatics for structural genomics projects
        * Protein function and interactions prediction
        * Structural modeling of human disease SNPS

   Congratulations to Zhen!
   Congratulation to Zhen Wang on successful completion of her
   dissertation. It was not easy, but after four years of hard work, three
   hours of grueling defense and two champagne drinks, she is now a PhD.

   New Cluster Nodes
   Our Linux cluster is growing. The farm was upgraded to new 24 port
   fiber optics switch and 10 new computer nodes were installed. This
   brings a total size of the farm to 30 Pentium III CPUs.

   We are moving!
   Our old homepage located at http://moult.carb.nist.gov will be blocked
   by the NIST firewall. So we are moving all our carb.nist.gov servers to
   the University of Maryland network.

   All traffic going to old carb.nist.gov servers will get routed to
   umbi.umd.edu domains. This means that most of the old links will be
   working fine, within exception of http://indigo5.carb.nist.gov domain
   links.
