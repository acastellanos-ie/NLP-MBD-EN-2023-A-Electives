   Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA)
   Established in 1992 and based on a four-year pilot project, the
   Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) Program provides
   opportunities for fully-prepared first and second year teachers to
   expand and deepen their teaching knowledge and skill. The BTSA Program
   also provides a smooth transition into the complex responsibilities of
   teaching, increases the retention of beginning teachers, and improves
   learning opportunities for their K-12 students. The BTSA Program has
   grown extensively in recent years. By July of 1999 the program had
   already expanded to serve over 23,000 first and second year teachers,
   with plans underway to expand services to 29,000 beginning teachers by
   January 2002.
