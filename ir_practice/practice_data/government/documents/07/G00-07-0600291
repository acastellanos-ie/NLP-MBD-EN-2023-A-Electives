   The Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC or
   Council) provides a "one-stop" siting process for major energy
   facilities in the State of Washington. The Council coordinates all of
   the evaluation and licensing steps for siting major energy facilities
   in Washington. If a project is approved, EFSEC specifies the conditions
   of construction and operation; issues permits in lieu of any other
   individual state or local agency authority; and manages an
   environmental and safety oversight program of facility and site
   operations.
