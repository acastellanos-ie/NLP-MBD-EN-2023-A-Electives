   The mission of the SPDF is to enhance the scientific return from NASA
   programs in the space physics sciences. It has its primary intent to
   lead in the definition, development, operation and promotion of
   collaborative efforts in the collection and utilization of space
   physics data and models. The SPDF will respond to the research needs of
   the space physics community.

   The SPDF (Code 632) is a part of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
   and is the host for many programs and efforts formerly part of the
   National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) until the reorganization
   that formed SPDF in June 1992. The SPDF remains an evolving
   organization, with a professional staff approximately evenly split
   between working scientists and technologists.
