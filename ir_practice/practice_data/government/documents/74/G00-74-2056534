   Measuring Winds with Lasers   [ SPARCLE Home ]   [ MACAWS Home ]

   A large gap in our understanding of the world's weather and climate is
   knowledge of wind speeds and directions in clear air. Instruments on
   the ground or on balloons and satellite instruments are limited with
   respect to measuring winds. In fact, direct measurements of global
   winds are the single most important missing data set at the present
   time with respect to weather forecasts and climate analyses. A laser
   wind sensor aboard an Earth observing platform is the strongest
   candidate to fill this gap.

   [sparcle.jpg] To demonstrate technologies for such an instrument,
   NASA/Marshall and the GHCC were authorized in 1997 to develop the SPAce
   Readiness Coherent Lidar Experiment (SPARCLE), a low-cost demonstration
   sponsored by NASA's New Millennium Program. In operation, SPARCLE scans
   a circular pattern across the Space Shuttle's ground track, aiming
   pulses of eye-safe laser light into the atmosphere and measuring the
   light that is reflected back to it by dust and aerosols in the
   atmosphere. The time between pulse and echo will (like radar) determine
   the distance to an object. The shift in the color of the light will
   tell how fast the particles are moving along the laser's line of sight.
   Combining measurements from viewing ahead to viewing aft will provide
   two velocity components, from which the true wind speed and direction
   can be calculated in a column from the surface of the Earth to an
   altitude of 10 to 20 km. For all its ambition, SPARCLE will start with
   a modest size; two "Getaway Specials," cans the size of a large
   wastepaper basket, will contain a laser with output power of only 0.6
   watts, the optical system, and the appropriate electronics. Using a
   "GAS can" will allow scientists to put SPARCLE's optical and electronic
   systems in a pressurized environment without having to ruggedize them
   for space. Although it will operate for only about 24 hours, SPARCLE
   will demonstrate technologies for an operational laser sounder aboard a
   future Earth observing platform. The Shuttle mission is scheduled to
   fly in 2001.

   [dc8.gif] The technology chosen for SPARCLE has been amply demonstrated
   on aircraft in meteorological studies. The GHCC-led Multi-center
   Airborne Coherent Atmospheric Wind Sensor (MACAWS) flies on the NASA
   DC-8 research aircraft. MACAWS has a world-class capability to measure
   fields of winds at several vertical levels by scanning the laser beam
   during flight. This permits the study of atmospheric processes and
   features that may be inadequately resolved or missed completely by more
   conventional techniques, such as ground-based radar. For example,
   measurements of the multi-level wind field near Point Arena,
   California, in June 1996 (figure below), readily show the northerly
   flow in the marine layer, the strong variability in the cross-shore
   direction within the marine boundary layer (especially at 150 m above
   sea level), and the structural changes in the vertical components.
   MACAWS is well-suited to study coastal meteorological processes,
   especially in regions where complex terrain may affect the siting and
   operation of other sensors. Several field experiments with be conducted
   with MACAWS in the future, including study of the intensification and
   tracking of Atlantic hurricanes in summer 1998, and simulation and
   validation of SPARCLE.
