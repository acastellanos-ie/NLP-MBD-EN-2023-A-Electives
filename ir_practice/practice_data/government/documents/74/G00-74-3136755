   Time and Frequency Division


   About the Division
   The Time and Frequency Division, part of NIST's Physics Laboratory,
   maintains the standard for frequency and time interval for the United
   States, provides official time to the United States, and carries out a
   broad program of research and service activities in time and frequency
   metrology.

                                  Services
      The division broadcasts standard time and frequency signals using
       radio, Internet, and telephone links. These signals synchronize
                        millions of clocks every day.

       Optical Clockwork
   New Optical Clock Promises More Accuracy than Cesium. NIST researchers
   have demonstrated a new kind of atomic clock that has the potential to
     be up to 1,000 times more accurate than todays best clock. The new
   clock is based on an energy transition in a single trapped mercury ion
    (a mercury atom that is missing one electron). Building a clock based
   on such a high-frequency transition was previously impractical because
     it requires both capturing the ion and holding it very still to get
     accurate readings, and having a mechanism that can count the ticks
                    accurately at such a high frequency.
   The quality of a clock depends on its stability and accuracywhether the
    clock provides a constant, unchanging output frequency, and how close
     the measured frequency is to the fundamental atomic resonance that
     provides the clocks tick. One advantage of the new clock is that it
    ticks much faster. Todays international time and frequency standards,
   such as NIST-F1, measure an atomic resonance of about 9 billion cycles
      per second. By contrast, the new NIST device monitors an optical
   frequency more than 100,000 times higher or about 1 quadrillion cycles
                                 per second.
