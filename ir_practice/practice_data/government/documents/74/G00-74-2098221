     This public service is cooperatively provided by the two time agencies
         of United States: a Department of Commerce agency, the National
         Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and its military
       counterpart, the U. S. Naval Observatory (USNO). Readings from the
      clocks of these agencies contribute to world time, called Coordinated
     Universal Time (UTC). The time maintained by both agencies should never
           differ by more than 0.000 0001 seconds from UTC (see recent
     comparisons).

     This web site is intended as a time-of-day service only. It should not
     be used to measure frequency or time interval, nor should it be used to
     establish traceability to NIST or the USNO.
     If you do not see the animated clock or you see an error statement of
     "Net Congestion", try clicking on "Disable Java Animation" in order to
     see a static clock.

     To see the animated clock, be sure that java is enabled on your
     browser. Otherwise, try a different or newer browser.  Also, you may be
     behind a firewall and you will need to have your network administrator
     open port 8013 in order for it to work.
     If the light/dark region looks incorrect, try reloading the page.
   Setting Your Computer Clock
     You can download software from NIST and theUSNO in order to use the
     Internet to automatically set your computer clock to the correct time.
