   This listing of updated rules originated from the notebook version that
   the Office of Surface Mining provided to public in the past. The
   website regulations are continually in the process of being updated (by
   chapter) and are current through the date marked in red. Care has been
   taken to ensure the correctness of the material furnished here, such as
   cites and other information that precede each regulation. However,
   users of this internet version of the rules should be aware when citing
   Office of Surface Mining regulations that the Code of Federal

   regulations. The Government Printing office also provides an electronic
   copy of the annual printed version of 30 CFR Part 700 to the end in
