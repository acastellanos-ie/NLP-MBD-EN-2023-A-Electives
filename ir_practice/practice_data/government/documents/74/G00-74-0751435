   American Geophysical Union electronic journals

   [agu_foot.gif] The American Geophysical Union (AGU) has announced the
   availability of institutional online access to their journals as of
   January 2002.

   The price for providing LANL-wide online access will be 2.6 times the
   cost of our 2001 print AGU subscriptions. As a point of reference, our
   2001 subscription to Journal of Geophysical Research was $5,800. 2002
   electronic access for this journal will cost $13,444 with additional
   charges of $1,662 for a print copy.

   The LANL Research Library finds the AGU institutional pricing policy to
   be extremely unreasonable. The prices that AGU demands for its journals
   will have a negative impact on the ability of most libraries to support
   the geoscience community, since most libraries will be required to pay
   for access at the same exorbitant rate as LANL. Already, libraries and
   institutions are refusing to accede to AGU unwarranted price increases.

   Given that the price for electronic access to AGU journals will
   increase by 2.6 times their current rate for print, that access is also
   limited to buildings within a 5-mile radius of the library and that AGU
   refuses to negotiate the terms of their license agreement -- the LANL
   Research Library finds it very difficult to consider electronic access
   under these conditions.

   The AGU subscription policy compares with what was considered
   unacceptable policy from the publishers of Nature. Last year Nature
   introduced a similar outrageous subscription model -- and after an
   intense campaign the library community convinced them to change their
   policy.

   Additional information on the AGU institutional access policy can be
   found at http://www.agu.org/pubs/Institution_Info_2002.pdf. AGU's
   justification for library/institutional pricing can be found in EOS
   Nov. 20, 2001 issue on p.575. In short, library budgets are expected to
   pick up the major transfer in AGU production costs.

   We know that our customers value the AGU journals, however we do not
   feel that your needs can be served by subscribing to these journals
   under these circumstances. We encourage our customers to express their
   opinions on the AGU institutional subscription policy. The contacts at
   AGU are below. Please include Carol Hoover (hoover@lanl.gov) as a
   courtesy copy of your email message.

   New library web page on bioinformatics

   To support the Genomes to Life efforts at LANL, Research Library staff
   have reviewed hundreds of related web resources in the areas of
   genomics, genetics, and bioinformatics.

                             [bioinf_banner.jpg]

   The new Bioinformatics page
   (http://lib-www.lanl.gov/infores/bioinformatics.htm) contains over 40
   links to
   databases and indexes, electronic journals, conferences, organizations,
   software, suppliers, news sources, job opportunities and other
   electronic reference publications.

   Any additional suggestions for links to this page, please direct ideas
   to Lou Pray, lpray@lanl.gov.

   Library statistical highlights from the past year

   As we review statistics for library products and services for the past
   year, we would like to spotlight some key facts and figures that may be
   of interest to Lab readers.

   Last year the Library web server was queried over 875,000 times. The
   web allowed millions of interactions with our patrons, from e-mail that
   we receive from almost every country in the world to online chat
   teaching sessions provided by our Ask A Librarian virtual reference
   service.

   The web allows the luxury of printing articles in your office from the
   electronic journals. This heavily used service now seems commonplace to
   our technical staff. During the last year LANL scientists pressed the
   print button over 220,000 times. The Research Library budget provides
   subscriptions to the e-journals you receive, as well as the databases.
   This budget also funds the skilled staff and computing resources that
   facilitate the access and design the interfaces that create ease of use
   of these products.

   In 2001 we loaded over 1/2 million electronic articles on the Librarys
   servers. We also placed over 1,200,000 links enabling you to access
   articles both from the Librarys servers and worldwide, from publishers
   and societies. These links make it seamless for you to locate the
   information you need by matching the database entries directly to the
   article. Of the many databases provided for your use, about ten of the
   most popular provide this linking feature. To keep the databases
   up-to-date we added over 2 1/2 million citations to them, many of these
   are received daily. Over a million searches were keyed into the
   Library-sponsored databases, on every topic from anthrax to zeolites.

   Although the Library is moving as quickly as possible to the electronic
   format, in 2001 we received 15,098 print journal issues, over 5,100
   books and added over 78,000 print and microfiche unclassified technical
   reports to the catalog. These statistics add up to a very successful
   year of providing needed information to our primary customers to
   support their research and increase their productivity. If there are
   types of information that you need please send us an e-mail at:
   library@lanl.gov

   Additional subject areas added to MyLibrary at LANL personalization
   product

   [mylib.gif] Two new disciplines, Bioinformatics and Materials Science,
   have been added to MyLibrary at LANL. MyLibrary at LANL allows you to
   create a collection of personal links to electronic journals,
   databases, and other web resources based on specific disciplines.

   During the sign-up process you select an initial primary area of
   interest (specific discipline). This primary interest determines how
   your first Library in MyLibrary @ LANL is populated. You can then add
   more libraries with other associated areas of interest.

   The other specific disciplines available in MyLibrary at LANL are:

   Astronomy, Biology/Genetics, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science,
   Current News, Defense/Military, Earth Science, Engineering,
   Environment, Government, Grants and Funding, Health & Safety,
   International Affairs, Library Science, Mathematics, Medicine, Nuclear
   Information, Personal, Physics, Reports, Science (General/Popular),
   Social Sciences, and Standards and Regulations.

   Search engines: A new year with new Google services

   [google_sm.gif] Does Google have a search box that can probe our secret
   desires? They must, for their newest service--now in beta mode--has
   discovered our inner-shopper. Google has just mounted all those
   catalogs that weve been receiving for the holidays. Yes, you can take
   them to the recycle center because they now live in your computer.
   Starting with 1,500 of our favorites Google has created a terrific
   site.

   The Google Catalogs simple search page includes the characteristic
   Google search box. The remainder of the screen classifies the catalogs
   into broad subject headings, so you can browse the covers quickly in
   Food & Gourmet. A search from this page will look at ALL the
   catalogs, so you need to be specific.

   The presentation of the results is innovative. On the left of your
   screen is an image of the catalog cover, adjacent is an image of the
   catalog page with your search terms enclosed in a tinted box. Beside
   this is an enlargement of the tinted box, with your search terms
   highlighted. The most relevant entries are at the top of the page. Our
   initial search for snowflake flannel pajamas gave us results that
   began with our targeted jammies and by the bottom of the page was
   showing us what was available matching the search terms flannel and
   pajamas. This is a fine way to present visual results quickly, and a
   click on any illustration brings the full page immediately to the
   screen. In the week that Ive been watching this site they have added
   advanced search options, the ability to search past catalogs, and
   filtering options to allow searching specific catalogs or categories.

   By starting at the main Google search page and choosing Advanced
   Search, you can now try some other new Google ideas. Scroll to the
   bottom of the ADVANCED SEARCH PAGE and youll discover a list that
   includes topic-specific searches such as: universities, LINUX, BSD Unix
   and Apple Macintosh.

   Once again, Google makes us happy.
