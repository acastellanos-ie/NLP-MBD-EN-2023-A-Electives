      Conservation is the work of many. The NRCS relies on partners to help
      set conservation goals, work with people on the land, and provide
      services. Our partners include conservation districts, local, state and
      federal agencies, and agricultural and environmental groups. The local
      conservation delivery system is a growing partnership. Our core
