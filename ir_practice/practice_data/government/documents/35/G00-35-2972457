   Owen, Synnott and Null is the written report of a talk given by Bill Owen at
   a colloquium on "Modern Astrometry and Astrodynamics", held in Vienna in May
   1998 to celebrate the 70th birthday of the late Heinrich Eichhorn, whose
   "overlapping plates method" is routinely used in our data reduction.
