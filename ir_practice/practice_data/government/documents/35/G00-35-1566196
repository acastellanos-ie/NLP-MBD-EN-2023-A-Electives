UEET Relationships to Other Programs and Agreements

   The following is an initial list of agreements to advance technology
   development in the UEET Program between NASA and external
   organizations. These agreements with government agencies and industrial
   partners are important to leverage the critical technical expertise
   developed in other aerospace programs.
     * Interagency Agreement between the Department of Transportation
       (DOT) Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) and NASA defining the
       framework and structure of the FAA-NASA Coordinating Committee.

     * NASA/Department of Defense Integrated High Performance Turbine
       Engine Technology Master Plan.

     * Interagency Agreement between the Department of Energy (DOE) and
       NASA Glenn for information sharing regarding Ceramic Matrix
       Composite (CMC) combustors and turbine airfoil work.

     * Interagency Agreement between NASA and the Environmental Protection
       Agency (EPA) to jointly fund the development of a risk assessment
       to determine the human health and environmental impact from
       aircraft pollutants.

     * Space Act Agreement between Lockheed-Martin Corporation and NASA
       Glenn for preliminary activities in support of a supersonic
       business jet program.

     * Umbrella Space Act Agreement between NASA Glenn Research Center and
       General Electric Company for Reimbursable and Non-reimbursable
       Research Activities to program umbrella authority for NASA GRC and
       GE to conduct mutually beneficial research upon the execution of
       task orders detailing the research activities.
