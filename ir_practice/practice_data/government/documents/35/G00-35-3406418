                    * Final Economic Assessment
                            This document analyzes the potential impact of
                            allowing motor vehicle dealers and repair businesses
                            to install air bag on-off switches in vehicles. This
                            option is being considered in response to concerns
                            that current air bags may injure or kill some
                            occupants in low speed crashes.
