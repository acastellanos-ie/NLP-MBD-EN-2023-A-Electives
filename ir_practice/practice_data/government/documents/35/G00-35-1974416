                  Federal Energy and Water Management Award
   The Federal Energy and Water Management Award is sponsored each year by
       the Department of Energy (DOE) in conjunction with the Federal
      Interagency Energy Policy Committee ("656" Committee). The award
   recognizes significant contributions to the efficient use of energy and
                              water management.
      Each March, NASA Headquarters/Code JE publishes a call to all the
      centers for award nominations for the previous fiscal year. KSC's
       Awards Office collects inputs from the Energy Working Group and
    Environmental Working Group and forwards all nominations to Code JE.
    See award categories by group size and topics on the FEWM Website for
                            further description.
