   Information Collected and Stored Automatically

   As you browse through our Web site, we automatically gather and store
   certain information about your visit. That information includes the
   Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed our site; the
   date and time of your visit; the type of browser and operating system
   you used; the pages you visited and the files you downloaded; and, if
   you linked to the CBO site from another Web site, the address of that
   site.

   We use that information to help us make our site more useful to you,
   our visitors--to learn about the number of visitors to our site, what
   information we provide is of most interest, and the types of Internet
   technology our visitors use.

   We also collect information to help keep our site secure and to ensure
   that this site remains available to all visitors. We use software
   programs to monitor network traffic and identify unauthorized attempts
   to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage. Such
   unauthorized activities are strictly prohibited and may be punishable
   under law.

   Except for the purposes already noted, no other attempts are made to
   identify individual users or their usage habits.

   If You Send Us Personal Information

   E-mail

   Any personal information provided to us in an e-mail is used only to
   respond to your message and to help us ensure that you receive any
   information you have requested.

   ListServer

   Any information you provide as part of our ListServer is used only to
   notify you of documents in requested areas of interest, errata
   information issued in connection with those documents, or general Web
   site information (for example, planned downtime for maintenance).

   The information you provide to us through e-mail or our ListServer is
   not shared with any other organizations (subject to applicable laws),
   nor is it used for any commercial marketing purposes.

   Subscribing and Unsubscribing to Our ListServer

   Subscribing

   You may choose to receive automatic notifications about new CBO
   documents in subject areas of interest to you. The ListServer covers
   CBO's reports, studies, papers, and memorandums as well as cost
   estimates of bills (available by budget function). To subscribe, simply
   fill in your e-mail address and areas of interest on our ListServer
   subscription form. You will receive a confirmation e-mail to which you
   must reply before being listed as a subscriber.

   Unsubscribing

   The easiest way to unsubscribe is to reply to your last
   document-notification e-mail, changing the subject to contain only the
   word REMOVE.

   If you are having difficulty unsubscribing or are an Administrator
   trying to unsubscribe a former employee, please e-mail our Webmaster
   with the address to be unsubscribed.

   Information Pertaining to Job Announcements

   Although CBO makes every effort to keep the Job Opportunities section
   up to date, there may be times when jobs listed have already been
   filled. CBO is an equal opportunity employer.
