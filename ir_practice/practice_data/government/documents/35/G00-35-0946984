   Spinning-wing Decoys:

   Hunters are also prohibited from using the popular motorized or
   electronic spinning wing duck decoys until Dec. 1. Wind powered devices
   or kites are still allowed as are any other motorized decoys that do
   not use a spinning blade or wing such as flying and landing decoys with
   fixed wings, decoys with flapping wings, decoys that dive, bob, swim,
   shake, quiver, or thrash the water.
   For purposes of this regulation, such a decoy on water, on a pole, on
   shore or otherwise positioned to potentially attract waterfowl will be
   in use as a electronic/mechanical decoy unless the motor is disabled or
   removed, or the battery or other power source is removed or the decoy
   is otherwise determined to be inoperable.
