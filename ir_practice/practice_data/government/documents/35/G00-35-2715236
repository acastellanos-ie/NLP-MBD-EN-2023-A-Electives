   A Message From the Secretary

   Finding a solution to the glassy-winged sharpshooter/Pierce's disease
   pest problem is one of my top priorities. I am committed to moving
   aggressively and effectively against this serious pest/disease
   combination which threatens so many key crops in California.

   My first concern when I heard about this problem was that the resources
   directed against it be used effectively. To this end, CDFA quickly took
   on the role of providing statewide coordination of regional efforts.
   The task forces I have appointed have had broad representation to
   encourage statewide coordination.

   Combating this problem defies a simple solution and demands a
   multi-pronged approach. In a very short time, the various stakeholders
   - CDFA, USDA, County Agricultural Commissioners, the University of
   California, and the agricultural industry - have worked together to
   develop a strategy for fighting this problem.

   We are now implementing a statewide management program composed of the
   following four primary elements:
     * Inspection of nursery stock moving from infested counties and from
       other states to slow the spread of the pest;
     * Statewide survey to determine the distribution of glassy-winged
       sharpshooter;
     * Establishment of multi-county pest management areas to begin
       treatment in infested areas or to develop contingency plans to
       prepare for infestation; and
     * Aggressive public outreach to educate growers and others about the
       seriousness of this pest problem.

   Any actions we take must be firmly based on the best available science.
   Consequently, research on glassy-winged sharpshooter and Pierce's
   disease is another vital part of our strategy against this pest
   complex.

   I am extremely gratified by the responsiveness of all stakeholders in
   helping to combat this pest, and look forward to their continued
   cooperation and contributions to this effort.

   William (Bill) J. Lyons, Jr., Secretary,
   California Department of Food and Agriculture
