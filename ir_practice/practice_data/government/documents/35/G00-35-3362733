                                                       Underwater Archaeology

   California Underwater State Parks Underwater archaeology deals with the
   problems of studying and managing inundated cultural resources.  As
   such, this branch of archaeology requires special methods to  discover,
   record and preserve these underwater resources, and most of its
   practitioners are SCUBA divers.  Underwater archaeology frequently
   deals with, but is not limited to, historic period ship wrecks.  Other
   underwater archaeological resources include artifacts discarded in
   rivers and bays, as well as sunken or flooded occupation sites.

   Underwater archaeology has great potential to contribute to our
   understanding of the prehistoric as well as the historic occupation of
   California.  Sea levels have risen over 300 feet since the end of the
   last Pleistocene ice age, inundating prehistoric coastal archaeological
   sites that can only be studied using underwater archaeological methods.

   There's a little-known part of California State Parks that's completely
   under water. It's the underwater parks program. The  underwater parks
   program was established in 1968 to preserve the best representative
   examples of California's natural underwater resources found in coastal
   and inland waters. The program also aims to provide a variety of
   underwater recreational opportunities, especially in areas near
   metropolitan centers. For more information, visit our Underwater Parks
   web.
