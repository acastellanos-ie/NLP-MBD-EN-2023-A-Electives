Imagine what it is like to finish a day's
    work and know that you stopped a shipment of illegal drugs from
    reaching neighborhood kids, nabbed a spy, tracked a terrorist
    across the world, protected the environment, kept the government
    honest, or safeguarded national and economic security.



                 FBI Agents do all of this and much more....



The FBI is made up of people from all walks
    of life. We are adamantly committed to promoting diversity within
