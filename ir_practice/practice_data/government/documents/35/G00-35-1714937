  What are UPS, UPD and UPP?

   UPS (UNIX Product Support) is a software support toolkit developed at
   Fermilab for the management of software products on local systems by
   the system administrators and users. It was also designed to facilitate
   the product distribution and configuration management tasks of the
   product providers. The three principal user benefits are:
     * a uniform interface for accessing all products on a UNIX (or
       UNIX-like, e.g., Cygwin) system via the setup command
     * unified and coordinated support of in-house and vendor-supplied
       software across all the supported UNIX operating systems
     * the capacity for running multiple concurrent versions of products
       on the same system, with a standard, simple version-selection
       mechanism

   UPD (UNIX Product Distribution) is a companion product to UPS, and
   provides the functionality for uploading/downloading products between
   local systems and product distribution servers.

   UPP (UNIX Product Poll) is a layer on top of UPD that allows a client
   to request notification of changes in a distribution node database and
   to download pre-specified products. UPP can be automated. This is a
   useful tool for keeping abreast of changes/enhancements to your
   favorite products.

   In the summer of 1998, the completely-rewritten UPS and UPD were
   released. These product management tools have been redesigned in
   preparation for Run II Computing needs. The new UPS/UPD is much more
   user friendly for product developers and installers; the setup
   interface for end users remains largely unchanged, but is much faster.
