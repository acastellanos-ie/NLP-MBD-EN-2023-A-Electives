   YOUR WEIGHT ON MARS
       Because Mars is less dense than Earth, it has much less gravity. In
   fact, Mars has about ^1/[3] the gravity of Earth. This means that
   things weigh less on Mars. Use our planetary scale to weigh yourself on
   Mars and other planets in the solar system.

       If you want to be a real engineer, set your hands to work on paper
   models of: Pathfinder, Mars Global Surveyor (pdf), and 2001 Mars
   Odyssey Color or Black-and-White (pdfs) spacecraft.

       Be a planetary mapmaker by creating a topography, or topo, map of
   the Martian surface.

       Help engineers design a spacecraft by connecting the dots or earn
   your pilot wings by navigating through the maze of outerspace.

       Peer through our solar telescope to get a view of any planet in the
   solar system.

       Learn how robots help scientists explore the universe or read the
   story of a Little Rock on Mars.
