   The President's Challenge is a physical activity/fitness awards program
   of the PCPFS. During a school year more than 4.2 million awards are
   distributed.

   Have your students perform exercises that build strength, endurance and
   flexibility as well as motivate students to adopt and maintain
   physically active lifestyles. If they're between ages 6 and 17, they're
   eligible to meet the President's Challenge! Your students can join the
   over 65 million award-winners since we started the school-based program
   back in 1966.
