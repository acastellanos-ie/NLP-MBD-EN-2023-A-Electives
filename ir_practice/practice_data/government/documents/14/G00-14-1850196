                    Energy Performance of Buildings Group

   The Energy Performance of Buildings group (EPB) works on problems
   associated with whole-building integration involving modeling,
   measurement, design and operation. Most of its tasks have focused on
   the movement of air and associated penalties involving distribution of
   pollutants, energy and fresh air. The major research areas of the group
   fall into three categories: residential research, non-residential
   research, and standards research and development.

   In addition to these projects the EPB Staff has worked extensively with
   other projects around the Laboratory including those related to the
   Federal Energy Management Program of Department of Energy, LBNL's
   Building Performance Assurance project and the California Institute for
   Energy Efficiency.

   This group is part of the Indoor Environment Department which is in the
   Environmental Energy Technologies Division of the Lawrence Berkeley
   National Laboratory.
