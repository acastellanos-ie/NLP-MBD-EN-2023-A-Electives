            President Bush Approves $6.2 Billion Budget for HRSA

   The Health Resources and Services Administrations Fiscal Year 2002
   budget will total $6.2 billion, an increase of $545 million over last
   years discretionary spending level.  President Bush signed legislation
   containing the FY 2002 figures on Jan. 10.

   The President also signed supplemental terrorist recovery
   appropriations, with HRSA receiving $275 million for
   counter-bioterrorism activities.

   This new budget is evidence that Congress and the administration have
   great confidence in our mission and our ability to meet it, said HRSA
   Acting Administrator Elizabeth M. Duke, Ph.D.  It is a strong vote of
   support for our goal to increase access to vital health care services
   for the Nations most vulnerable individuals and families.

   The FY 2002 appropriation contains the following changes for HRSA
   bureaus and offices:
     * the budget for HIV/AIDS programs under the Ryan White CARE Act will
       increase by $103 million over the FY 2001 adjusted appropriation to
       $1.91 billion in FY 2002;
     * the overall budget for Primary Health Care programs will rise by
       $159 million to $1.48 billion, which includes a $175 million
       increase over the FY 2001 appropriation for community health
       centers;
     * funds for Maternal and Child Health programs will increase by $56
       million to almost $942 million;

     * Health Professions programs for training, scholarships, diversity
       and placements will rise by $48 million to $533 million (the
       National Health Service Corps was transferred to the Bureau of
       Health Professions in 2001);

     * the budget for Special Programs will jump by $67 million to $369
       million, largely due to one-time-only health facilities
       construction projects;

     * funds for Rural Health programs will increase by $37 million to
       $149 million; and

     * the budget for Telehealth projects will rise by $3 million to $39
       million, due to one-time earmarked projects.

   The increase for the health center program represents a down payment on
   President Bushs five-year plan to create new or expand health center
   sites in 1,200 communities and increase the number of patients served
   by 6 million.  The president's long-term goal is to double the number
   of people served.  Health center programs each year provide
   family-oriented preventive and primary health care services to more
   than 10.5 million people at 3,200 access points nationwide.

   The budget also includes two new programs:
     * the Radiogenic Disease State program ($4 million) will make grants
       to state and local health care organizations to support early
       detection, prevention and education programs to help thousands of
       individuals exposed to radiation from the mining of uranium and the
       testing of nuclear weapons; and

     * the Rural Access to Automatic External Devices program ($12.5
       million) will increase the availability of defibrillators in rural
       communities.

   year's figures.
