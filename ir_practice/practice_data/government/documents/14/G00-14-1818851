   Study Shows That Aspirin and Warfarin Are Equally Effective for Stroke
   Prevention

   Overview A study appearing in the November 15, 2001, issue of The New
   England Journal of Medicine shows that aspirin works as well as
   warfarin in helping to prevent recurrent strokes in most patients. The
   Warfarin versus Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study (WARSS) was a 7-year
   double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 2,206 patients at 48
   participating centersthe largest trial to date comparing aspirin to
   warfarin for recurrent stroke prevention. The study was sponsored by
   the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

   A study appearing in the November 15, 2001, issue of The New England
   Journal of Medicine* shows that aspirin works as well as warfarin in
   helping to prevent recurrent strokes in most patients. The Warfarin
   versus Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study (WARSS) was a 7-year
   double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 2,206 patients at 48
   participating centersthe largest trial to date comparing aspirin to
   warfarin for recurrent stroke prevention. The study was sponsored by
   the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

   "Treatment is far superior to no treatment and treatment with either
   aspirin or warfarin is safe under carefully monitored conditions," says
   J. P. Mohr, M.D., director of the Stroke Unit at New York's Columbia
   University and lead investigator of the trial.

   Both drugs slow clotting of the blood, and blood clots are involved in
   the final stages of the most common type of stroke due to blockage of
   the vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain. Aspirin affects
   the blood platelets, while warfarin inhibits circulating clotting
   proteins in the blood. Aspirin has been used for over 100 years, but
   its beneficial effects to prevent stroke and heart attack only started
   to be recognized in the 1970s. Whether warfarin was superior to aspirin
   for stroke prevention was unclear prior to WARSS. Numerous previous
   studies have proven that use of aspirin reduces recurrent stroke by
   about 25 percent. Part of the controversy about aspirin versus warfarin
   for stroke prevention has been the thinking among clinicians that
   warfarin may be a better blood thinner than aspirin to prevent almost
   all forms of stroke, but that it has greater side effects, increased
   risk of hemorrhage, and higher costs due to the need for blood tests to
   monitor the treatment effect for patients.

   An earlier NINDS trial, Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study
   (SPAF), cleared up some of the confusion by showing a distinct benefit
   of warfarin over aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke in patients
   whose stroke was related to atrial fibrillation (AF)strokes caused by
   clots coming from the heart. About 15 percent of stroke patients have
   this heart rhythm abnormality, a condition in which the two upper
   chambers of the heart (the atria) do not have a rhythmic, forceful
   beat, and the pulse is irregular. Although the superior efficacy of
   warfarin versus aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with
   atrial fibrillation was confirmed in SPAF, greater insight was needed
   to determine optimal therapy in preventing recurrent stroke in the
   larger number of patients without clots in the heart, which was the
   purpose of the WARSS study.

   "We had evidence that patients with AF should be taking warfarin, but
   we didn't know which medicine to recommend to stroke patients without
   AF," said John R. Marler, M.D., Associate Director for Clinical Trials
   for the NINDS. "This scientifically sound definitive clinical trial
   provides important information in the fight against stroke. It supports
   the widespread use of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs, but it
   demonstrates an equally efficacious alternative, appropriate for
   selected patients," he added.

   To make the aspirin and warfarin arms of the study as unbiased as
   possible, the investigators matched both groups of patients for primary
   stroke severity, age, gender, education, and race/ethnicity. The two
   groups were also matched for stroke risk factors, including
   hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, smoking, alcohol consumption,
   and physical activity. The investigators used an aspirin dose of 325
   mg/day and a warfarin dose specifically tailored to each individual
   patient, and a double-blind plan in which neither the treating doctor
   nor the patient knew which treatment was being received.

   The study included patients who had strokes due to small vessel lacunar
   infarcts, the predominant type of stroke in people with diabetes;
   strokes due to large artery atherosclerosis (build-up of cholesterol
   plaques); and cryptogenic stroke of undetermined cause. The study
   excluded patients with atrial fibrillation, those with a blood clot in
   the heart, and those eligible for carotid endarterectomy surgery. For
   these patients, appropriate treatment guidelines already exist from
   earlier NINDS-sponsored clinical trials. For safety, patients with a
   history of severe bleeding from any cause and patients whose strokes
   were related to surgical procedures were not included in the trial.

   Several subsets of patients seemed to show slight benefits from one of
   the two therapies, but neither of the treatments showed a difference
   greater than would be expected from chance alone. The lacunar infarct
   and small vessel disease subgroup seemed to fare better with aspirin,
   as did, to a lesser extent, the large artery disease subgroup. The
   cryptogenic subgroup appeared to fare better with warfarin, but
   investigators believe some of these patients have a tendency to form
   blood clots in the heart. Four parallel studies for WARSS are looking
   for groups of patients who might gain more benefit from warfarin or
   aspirin. Additional analysis of the WARSS data may point to differences
   in the ability of aspirin and warfarin to prevent stroke for some
   patients. Overall, there was no evidence of significant differences
   between the two drugs.

   Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the
   leading cause of serious, long-term disability. Approximately 600,000
   new strokes are reported in the United States annually and about
   160,000 Americans die each year from stroke.

   Bristol-Myers Squibb Company provided an unrestricted educational grant
   for this study.

   The NINDS, part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
   Maryland, is the nation's leading supporter of research on the brain
   and nervous system. The NINDS is now celebrating its 50th anniversary.
