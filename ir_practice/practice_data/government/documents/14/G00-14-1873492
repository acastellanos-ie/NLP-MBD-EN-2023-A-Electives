   Evans Taps Bond for Chief of Staff As Fenton Returns to Private Sector

   Washington, DC - U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans today announced that
   Undersecretary for Technology Phil Bond will assume the additional role
   of chief of staff. Bond will replace Laurie Fenton, who is retiring
   from government service to return to the private sector.

   "Phil Bond's proven track record as an effective manager and strategic
   thinker, combined with his strong leadership in crucially important
   technology policy, make him a natural to build on the solid foundation
   Laurie Fenton has helped put in place during our first, very intensive
   year here at the Department of Commerce," Evans said. "Laurie has been
   central to building the top-notch team we have in place here, and her
   organizational groundwork has positioned us well, as we help the
   President create a positive environment for American business to
   flourish and create new jobs."

   Bond was nominated by President Bush, unanimously confirmed by the U.S.
   Senate and began his service as Undersecretary for Technology Policy at
   the Commerce Department in October 2001. As undersecretary, Bond
   develops science and technology policy to maximize technology's
   contribution to America's economic growth. Prior to joining the Bush
   Administration, Bond directed federal public policy for Hewlett-Packard
   Company and served as senior vice president for government affairs and
   treasurer of the Information Technology Industry Council. He previously
   served in government as chief of staff to Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn
   (R-WA), deputy assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs
   under then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, and chief of staff to
   Congressman Bob McEwen (R-OH).

   Evans views technology policy as a top priority in his mission to
   advocate for American business both at home and abroad. "Having Phil at
   my right hand at the helm of the Department ensures that our focus on
   technology as a vital component of our nation's economy continues,"
   Evans said.

   Fenton has agreed to stay on temporarily as counselor to Evans, to
   facilitate a smooth transition. After the rigors of helping get the new
   Commerce leadership in place and operating smoothly during the first
   year of the Bush Administration, she looks forward to a return to the
   private sector.
