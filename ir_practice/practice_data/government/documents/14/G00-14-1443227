                    Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative


   Privately owned grazing land makes up one third of the land base our
   Nation's lower 48 states.  Taking good care of these lands is critical
   to environmental, social, and economic stability.  The Grazing Lands
   Conservation Initiative (GLCI) was established to provide guidance on
   conservation issues to those who own private grazing lands. It is not a
   cost share program. This technical assistance will offer opportunities
   for:
     * Better grazing land management
     * Protecting soil from erosive wind and water
     * Using more energy-efficient ways to produce food and fiber
     * Conserving water
     * Providing habitat for wildlife
     * Sustaining forage and grazing plants
     * Using plants to sequester greenhouse gases and increase soil
       organic matter
     * Using grazing lands as a source of biomass energy and raw
       materials for industrial products

   New Hampshire Grazing Team Established

   There is a new structure for the statewide promotion of the Grazing
   Lands Conservation Initiative in New Hampshire. The Grazing Team is
   developing a plan for the year, identifying their training needs, and
   organizing workshops for the public on a variety of grazing land
   conservation topics. This team has been selected so that each field
   office now has a grazing contact. Team members are Jim Spielman (GLCI
   Coordinator), Dean Bascom, Rick Ellsmore, Bill Hoey, Heidi Smith,
   Lawrence Underhill, Dave Weathers, and Deb Weymouth. For more
   information about grazing lands conservation, contact the team member
   in the field office near you.
