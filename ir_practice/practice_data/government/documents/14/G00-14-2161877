   Stefan Claesson
   Biddeford, Maine
   Stefan Claesson is pursuing his Ph.D. in Natural Resources at the
   University of New Hampshire. He received his B.A. from Boston
   University and his M.A. from Texas A&M University in nautical
   archaeology. Born in Worcester, Massachusetts to Swedish immigrants,
   and raised in Cape Neddick, Maine, he has always had a strong
   connection to the sea and an equally strong interest in maritime
   history and archaeology. He has conducted archaeological surveys for
   shipwrecks and other vestiges of maritime culture along the southern
   coast of Maine for the past five years. Claesson is currently working
   to develop a Geographic Information System for the management and
   preservation of maritime cultural resources in New England.

                             Winnie Wing Yee Lau

   Winnie Wing Yee Lau
   Winnie Wing Yee Lau
   Seattle, Washington
   Winnie Wing Yee Lau is currently a Ph.D. student studying Biological
   Oceanography at the University of Washington. As an undergraduate, she
   majored in both Integrative Biology and Environmental Sciences at the
   University of California at Berkeley. Wing Yee Lau decided to pursue a
   graduate degree in basic scientific research, not only because she
   loved making new discoveries, but also because she realized that a
   solid scientific knowledge is the foundation of effective management of
   ecosystems.

   Ku'ulei S. Rodgers
   Waimanalo, Hawaii
   Ku'ulei Rodgers is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Marine Biology at the
   University of Hawaii. She was born and raised on the island of Oahu,
   the main island in the Hawaiian chain. She has always been employed in
   the marine field, spending several years working as an ocean recreation
   specialist teaching drownproofing to public school children and as a
   marine mammal trainer at an oceanarium. Her education career in marine
   biology began at Windward Community College where she quickly developed
   a strong background in marine science. She continued her education by
   earning her masters degree at the University of Hawaii at Manoa where
   she narrowed her focus to coral reef research. Rodgers current Ph.D.
   work also focuses on coral reef research, specifically working to
   identify bioindicators that may serve as an early warning of coral reef
   decline.

                            Laurie Ann Sorabella

   Laurie Ann Sorabella
   Laurie Ann Sorabella
   Gloucester, Virginia
   Laurie Ann Sorabella is currently pursuing a M.S. degree in Marine
   Biology at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Her research
   centers on estuarine and coastal habitat restoration and on citizen
   involvement in restoration initiatives. Her thesis, entitled Oyster
   and seagrass interactions in ecological restoration, has two
   objectives. First, to define the most desirable oyster strain for use
   as broodstock in oyster reef restoration and second, to characterize
   water quality changes associated with a restored oyster reef and
   estimate the potential for reefs to create a more habitable environment
   for seagrasses. Before graduate school, Sorabella became inspired by
   the power of community involvement when she worked as Virginia Habitat
   Restoration Coordinator for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.

   Jennifer Wagner Whiteis
   Trumansburg, New York
   Jennifer Whiteis is pursuing a Ph.D. in Oceanography at Cornell
   University. She started her academic career at the University of North
   Carolina in Wilmington where she studied Earth Sciences and she then
   transferred to Cornell University where she graduated with a B.S.
   degree in Geology. As an undergraduate, she was awarded a NASA Space
   Grant Fellowship to carry out a project using remote sensing techniques
   to study physical ocean parameters that impact coral disease in the
   Caribbean Sea. This experience motivated Whiteis to continue studies
   with a more detailed, in-depth research project using a combination of
   multiple satellite sensors and in situ data to examine the impact of
   global climate change on Caribbean corals.
