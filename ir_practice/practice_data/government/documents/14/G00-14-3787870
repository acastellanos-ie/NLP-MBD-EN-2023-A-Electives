   THE WIRE SURVEY

   The WIRE survey will cover over 100 deg2 of sky and detect sources
   200-500 times fainter than the IRAS Faint Source Catalog at 25µm and
   500-2000 times fainter at 12µm. The resulting catalog, expected to
   contain at least 30,000 starburst galaxies, will reveal their
   evolutionary history out to redshifts of 0.5 - 1 and the evolutionary
   history of extremely luminous galaxies beyond redshifts of 5. WIRE will
   be the first significant galaxy survey to probe these redshifts at
   far-infrared wavelengths where extinction effects are small and where
   most of the luminosity of starburst galaxies, and possibly of the
   universe, can be measured.
   THE WIRE DEEP SURVEY

   [space.gif] This color image is a simulation of the faint mid-infrared
   sky as it may appear to WIRE. The image was constructed from
   simulations of 25 µm and 12 µm WIRE images of a field located near the
   North Galactic Pole. The field is approximately 0.5° on each side, and
   over 200 objects are visible. Stars are the blue objects, and galaxies,
   most of which are undergoing a burst of star formation, range from
   green to red. (The colors of the brightest objects are distorted
   because we cannot fully represent the dynamic range of the WIRE data in
   this rendering). The red galaxies tend to be the most luminous and
   distant ones. The redshift distribution of galaxies in the image peaks
   near z=0.5, and our model assumes that the galaxy population is weakly
   evolving with lookback time. The brightest galaxy near the lower right
   corner has a 25 µm flux density of 87 mJy. The faintest discrete
   sources visible have 25 µm flux densities less than 0.5 mJy. The lumpy
   red background is the confusion noise caused by multitudes of still
   fainter overlapping galaxies. Simulated by David Shupe (IPAC/JPL) and
   A. Kris Huber (Utah State University).

   The Science

   The WIRE mission consists of a four-month survey in 12 and 25 µm
   infrared color bands at sensitivity levels bounded by the telescopes
   25 µm confusion limit. The confusion limit is set by the density of the
   many faint, unresolved sources in the field of view and the resolving
   power of the telescope. The WIRE survey will detect primarily galaxies
   with unusually high rates of star formation or "starburst" galaxies
   which emit most of their energy in the far-infrared. The number of
   these faint sources at a given flux level depends on their as yet
   unknown evolutionary rate.

   One of the most important goals of modern astronomy is to understand
   the formation and evolution of galaxies. Starburst galaxies are an
   important population because they represent 30% of the energy budget of
   the local universe and because almost all of their luminosity is due to
   star-forming regions. They represent more than 30% of the star
   formation occurring today. If starburst galaxies have evolved, then
   they may represent the main source of stars in the universe. WIRE will
   help reveal the role of starbursts in the evolution of all galaxies.
   Models of protogalaxies also predict ultraluminous starbursts at early
   epochs, implying that WIRE may determine when galaxies formed.

   The objective of the WIRE mission is to answer three questions:
    1. What fraction of the luminosity of the universe at redshifts of 0.5
       and beyond is due to starburst galaxies?
    2. How fast and in what ways are starburst galaxies evolving?
    3. Are luminous protogalaxies common at redshifts less than 3?

   The scientific impact of the WIRE data will be immediate. The number of
   sources as a function of flux density will indicate the rate of
   evolution of the starburst galaxy population, that is, the variation of
   the number and luminosity of these galaxies with cosmic epoch. The
   infrared color distribution of sources detected as a function of flux
   density will reveal the nature of the evolution of starburst galaxies
   and point to protogalaxy candidates. Follow-up observations at other
   wavelengths will test our assumptions and lead serendipitously to new
   discoveries.

   The WIRE survey reaches so deeply into unexplored territory that it
   presents a significant opportunity for scientific investigation and
   discovery in many areas. Examples of additional investigations include
   exploring the proposed link between quasars and ultraluminous galaxies,
   searching for brown dwarfs, searching for circumstellar disks around
   main sequence stars and exploring the large-scale distribution of
   galaxies at high redshifts. There is great potential for discovery of
   entirely new phenomena at these faint flux levels.
