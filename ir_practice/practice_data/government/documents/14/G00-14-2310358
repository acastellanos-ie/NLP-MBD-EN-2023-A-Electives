   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Sensors & Electronics (S&E)
   staff provide scientific and technology development to meet a broad
   range of sensor, measurement technology, electronic (including
   controls), and system integration application requirements. Activities
   performed are tailored to meet client/project needs and include:
    a. scientific investigations and analysis
    b. feasibility studies
    c. measurement and data analysis, method development, validation, and
       application
    d. laboratory testing
    e. prototype equipment development and evaluation
    f. development and deployment of field hardened equipment and methods.

   Electronics devices and equipment are developed and deployed to support
   sensing and measurement applications and to meet stand-alone
   electronics requirements. PNNL's S&E staff possess a broad range of
   technical expertise and application area experience which allows them
   to form teams to advance the technology and to ensure that the
   development equipment and methods meet the practical application
   requirements. More detailed information is the provided in the Overview
   statement.

   The purpose of this website is to provide you with an efficient method
   to familiarize yourself with the PNNL Sensors and Electronics
   capabilities. Selected project examples are included to illustrate how
   these capabilities have been employed to meet a range of government and
   industry client needs. This website is still under development. Some
   PNNL S&E capabilities are not well represented at this time. Even in
   areas of the website that are fairly well populated, only selected
   technical capabilities and project examples are included. It is
   intended that the examples serve as the basis for discussion of
   specific project/client needs and how the PNNL S&E capabilities can
   assist in providing required solutions. Efforts are continuing to
   expand the coverage of the website materials to include additional
   capabilities and project examples. If you do not find specfic
   capabilities in the current website materials, please revisit our
   website in the future to examnine new materials added and/or contact us
   to determine if our capability portfolio includes capabilites and
   experience pertinent to your needs.

   We trust that you will find this website informative and helpful.
