   The mission of the Southern Plains Agricultural Research Center (SPARC)
   is to conduct research to improve the productivity of important
   southern crops, to enhance the safety to the consumer of meat products
   derived from livestock and poultry, and to develop improved methods for
   protection of livestock from debilitating insects and ticks. Specific
   projects at the Center are diverse and include plant biotechnology;
   improved control methodologies for pathogens and nematodes attacking
   cotton; improved aerial application of agricultural chemicals;
   germplasm enhancement of cotton, sorghum, forage grasses, and pecans;
   effective and environmentally-sound approaches for areawide management
   of the boll weevil, the corn earworm, and other serious insect pests;
   enhanced microbiological and chemical safety of meat products reaching
   the consumer; and the development of novel and
   environmentally-sensitive pest insect control procedures. Center
   scientists have a strong commitment to the solution of significant
   agricultural problems and to the timely and effective transfer to
   appropriate users of technology developed through their research.  The
   Center is organized into the following five research units.
