     NOAA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) was established by a Decision
     Memorandum dated September 25, 1997. It is the only Federal Advisory
     Committee with responsibility to advise the Under Secretary of
     Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere on long- and short-range
     strategies for research, education and the application of science to
     resource management.

     SAB activities and advice provide necessary input to ensure that
     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) science
     programs are of the highest quality and provide optimal support to
     resource management, and environmental assessment and prediction.
     The 15-member advisory board assists NOAA in maintaining a complete
     and accurate understanding of scientific issues critical to the
     agency's missions.
     Composed of eminent scientists, engineers, resource managers and
     educators, the diverse membership of the Board assures expertise
     reflecting the full breadth of NOAA's responsibilities, as well as
     the ethnic and gender diversity of the US. Members are appointed by
     NOAA Administrator Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Jr. to serve a three-year
     term, with the possibility of renewing once.
