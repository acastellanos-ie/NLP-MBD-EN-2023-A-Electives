   The Theoretical Physics group at LBNL consists of senior staff members
   at Berkeley Lab, faculty members in the Physics Dept. at the University
   of California at Berkeley, a Division Fellow , the postdoctoral fellows
   and visitors, as well as graduate students from UC Berkeley.

Research activities

   The group's efforts can be divided into two major categories: particle
   theory and formal theory.

   Theoretical particle physics research is concerned with the standard
   model and possible deviations from, and extensions to, it. The group
   has worked on electroweak symmetry breaking, supersymmetry, grand
   unification, perturbative QCD, cosmology, and methods to test the
   standard model in current and future experiments.

   The formal theory group works on string theory, quantum gravity,
   conformal field theory, quantum groups, topological field theory and
   the foundations of quantum mechanics.

   location is usually 50A-5132, LBNL or 430 Birge Hall on the UC Berkeley
   campus. The seminar chairman is Prof Korkut Bardakci .

   The formal part of the group holds a seminar on Tuesday afternoon at
   2:10 pm at the Oppenheimer Center, Birge Hall on the UC Berkeley
   campus. The seminar chairman is Prof Petr Horava .

   The particle physics part of the group holds a seminar on Wednesday at
   12:30 pm in 50-5056, LBNL. The seminar chairman is Prof Hitoshi
