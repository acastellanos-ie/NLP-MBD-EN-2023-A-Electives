   If you are a servicemember or veteran looking for a civilian job, you
   should know that, depending on your occupational area, you may need a
   license or certificate in order to obtain a job in the civilian work
   force. This web site, UMET, is sponsored by the U.S. Department of
   Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), to make it
   easier for current and former military personnel to obtain the licenses
   and certifications they need to practice in the civilian work force.

   The Web site has two key components:
     * Transitioning to Civilian Careers - designed for servicemembers and
       veterans seeking information about how civilian licensure and
       certification requirements might affect their ability to obtain a
       civilian job.

     * Hiring Qualified Veterans - intended for employers seeking access
       to a qualified pool of skilled labor and credentialing board
       officials who would like to learn more about how to assess the
       comparability of military and civilian training.

   VETS provides a wide range of employment services to transitioning
   military personnel and veterans. If you would like more information
   about these services or would like access to job search sites, go to
   the VETS' home page.
