   The Air Quality Group is responsible for environmental air quality
   issues and provides regulatory and environmental surveillance
   leadership to meet Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) air quality
   obligations and public assurance needs. As the institutional group
   responsible for federal and state air quality regulatory agency
   interaction, ESH-17 partners with LANL's operating entities to develop
   and implement compliance assurance programs. This activity includes the
   drafting of air permits, monitoring of non-radioactive and radioactive
   air emissions, meteorological measurement and dose modeling, regulatory
   review, emergency management support, and emissions estimate
   engineering. The group is responsible for the management and oversight
   of extensive environmental surveillance networks to quantitatively
   evaluate the impact of radionuclide emissions from Laboratory
   operations. The group also serves as the Office of Institutional
   Coordination (OIC) for Laboratory Implementation Requirements (LIR) and
   Laboratory Implementation Guidance (LIG) for the Air Quality program.
