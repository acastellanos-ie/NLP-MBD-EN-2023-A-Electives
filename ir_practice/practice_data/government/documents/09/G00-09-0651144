                      Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Chain

   Lava flows of the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain in Long Valley
   Caldera, California. The most recent eruptions from along this chain
   occurred about 250 and 600 years ago.

                      Long Valley Caldera at a Glance

   The Caldera. Long Valley Caldera a 15- by 30-km oval-shaped depression
   located 20 km south of Mono Lake along the east side of the Sierra
   Nevada in east-central California. This area of eastern California has
   produced numerous volcanic eruptions over the past 3 million years,
   including the massive caldera-forming eruption 760,000 years ago. The
   most recent eruption occurred just 250 years ago in Mono Lake at the
   north end of Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain.

   Volcanic Unrest. In May of 1980, a strong earthquake swarm that
   included four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of
   Long Valley Caldera associated with a 25-cm, dome-shaped uplift of the
   caldera floor. These events marked the onset of the latest period of
   caldera unrest that continues to this day. This ongoing unrest includes
   recurring earthquake swarms and continued dome-shaped uplift of the
   central section of the caldera (the resurgent dome) accompanied by
   changes in thermal springs and gas emissions.

   USGS Monitoring. In 1982, the U.S. Geological Survey under the Volcano
   Hazards Program began an intensive effort to monitor and study geologic
   unrest in Long Valley caldera. The goal of this effort is to provide
   residents and civil authorities in the area reliable information on the
   nature of the potential hazards posed by this unrest and timely warning
   of an impending volcanic eruption, should it develop. Most, perhaps
   all, volcanic eruptions are preceded and accompanied by geophysical and
   geochemical changes in the volcanic system. Common precursory
   indicators of volcanic activity include increased seismicity, ground
   deformation, and variations in the nature and rate of gas emissions.
