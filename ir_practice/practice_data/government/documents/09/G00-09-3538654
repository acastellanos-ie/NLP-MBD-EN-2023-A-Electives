    JPL's Atmospheric Laser Spectroscopy Group seeks to understand the
    photochemistry, dynamics, and evolution of Earth and planetary atmospheres
    through interpretation of in-situ measurements of gas, particulate, and
    mineral composition using state-of-the-art laser spectrometers built by the
    group.  Over the last 17 years we have conceived, designed, and built a
    variety of tunable diode laser spectrometers that have flown on balloon,
    aircraft, and spacecraft platforms.  Laboratory spectroscopy and instrument
    miniaturization programs have produced high-sensitivity spectrometers
    weighing less than a kilogram.
    For Earth studies of stratospheric chlorine and nitrogen photochemistry, and
    of atmospheric transport, field measurements include: BLISS (balloon, 12
    flights); ALIAS (ER2-aircraft, 250 flights); JPL-Laser Hygrometer (ER-2
    aircraft, 40 flights; DC-8 aircraft, 30 flights); ALIAS-II (balloon, 8
    flights); WB57F hygrometer; and WISP, a new isotopic water instrument (for
    UAV).  These instruments have participated in 7 major field campaigns for
    NASA (AASE-II, SPADE, ASHOE, STRAT, POLARIS, CAMEX-3, SOLVE) from 1991
    through 2000 out of Texas, California, Maine, Alaska, Florida, Brazil,
    Hawaii, New Mexico, Fiji, New Zealand and Sweden.  We have used tunable
    laser absorption to make atmospheric measurements of numerous gases
    including balloon measurements of NO, NO[2], O[3], H[2]O, CO[2], CH[4],
    N[2]O, ^13CH[4], HDO, HCl, HNO[3]; and aircraft measurements of HCl, NO[2],
    N[2]O, CH[4], H[2]O, CO, ^13CO[2], and O[3].

    For planetary applications, we have developed two spectrometers based on
    mid-IR lead-salt tunable diode lasers: the PIRLS instrument for the Cassini
    Titan Probe (not selected); and the MIRLS instrument for Mars photochemistry
    developed for lander and Mars Airplane applications.  More recently, two
    near-IR laser spectrometers for Mars H[2]O and CO[2] isotopic measurements
    were sent to Mars as part of the Mars 98 Surveyor's (MVACS) payload. We are
    currently  building a prototype Mars near-IR TDL spectrometer (MOD) that we
    expect to be part of the Mars 2005 Lander payload.  In addition, we are
    developing room-temperature mid-IR Quantum Cascade Laser Spectrometers for
    Mars, Titan, Venus, and Europa, and are part of JPL's Grand Challenge
    Project studying biogenic gases and their isotopic ratios as signatures of
    extraterrestrial life.
