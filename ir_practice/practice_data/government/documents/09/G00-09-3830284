                    Nuclear Medicine & Functional Imaging

   The Department of Nuclear Medicine & Functional Imaging at the Lawrence
   Berkeley National Laboratory is involved in developing advanced
   positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed
   tomography (SPECT), and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   systems with capabilities beyond those currently envisioned for
   commercial implementation. The purpose of this research is to apply new
   technologies to the study of atherosclerosis, heart disease, aging,
   neurological and psychiatric diseases, and cancer. The joint approach
   of new technologies and experimental physiology is applied to medical
   science problems by a team of physicists, chemists, mathematicians,
   computer scientists, physiologists, and research physicians devoted to
   development of quantitative methods of experimental medical science.
   Autoradiography, and tracer studies in animals are also used, in
   addition to the noninvasive methods of nuclear medicine and MRI. There
   is a major emphasis on mathematical modeling and statistical analyses.

   Early results of this instrumentation work included the first
   demonstration of the clinical usefulness of the Anger camera and the
   tomoscanner. More recently, quantitative reconstruction algorithms, new
   compartment modeling methods, and statistical models of dynamic PET
   have been developed. A unique 2.6 mm resolution PET instrument and a
   state of the art commercial PET scanner are used to conduct clinical
   studies in epilepsy, Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia, coronary artery
   disease, brain tumors, breast tumors and prostate tumors.
