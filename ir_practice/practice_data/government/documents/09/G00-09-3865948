   Photgraph of Integrating Sphere Weathering Device BFRL's Integrating
   Sphere Weathering Device will allow researchers to introduce new
   technologies for UV exposure of polymeric materials Improve spatial
   irradiance uniformity, temperature control, and provide greater
   experimental flexibility in UV weathering instrumentation.

   Photograph of John Gross BFRL researcher, John Gross, has been awarded
   the 2000 "Commerce Engineer of the Year Award". John is also among the
   top ten finalists, from the 33 agency winners, one of which will be
   chosen as the "NSPE Federal Engineer of the Year". The National Society
   of Professional Engineers will choose the recipient during their awards
   ceremony in February.
