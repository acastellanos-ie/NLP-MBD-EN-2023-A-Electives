   Although Earth is our home, we still have much to discover about it. At
   the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we are using a myriad of scientific
   instruments to study our changing planet.

   The atmosphere around us holds keys to why we are able to live on our
   planet without the aid of the special equipment we need in space.
   Several projects at JPL are studying weather, climate and the evolving
   composition of the air around us.

   The solid surface of the Earth is changing over many different time
   scales. Land studies are being conducted from the ground, air and even
   from space. These studies will help us understand how we induce,
   modify, or inhibit those changes.

   Oceans cover more than two thirds of the surface of our planet. This
   vast quantity of water affects the weather and climate, and is partly
   responsible for the balance of atmospheric gases. Instruments on the
   surface of the ocean, on board ships, and in space are providing
   information about our oceans and their effect on local and global
   conditions.
