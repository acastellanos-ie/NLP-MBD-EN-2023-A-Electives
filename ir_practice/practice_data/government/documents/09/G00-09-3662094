   The Tropical Oceans Team is an interdisciplinary group of
   oceanographers working on coupled physical-biological models of the
   tropical Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. We have a variety of
   active projects, including basin-scale 3D coupled models, 1D simulation
   models in the western and central equatorial Pacific, field studies in
   the western Pacific Warm Pool, SeaWiFS data assimilation for
   biogeochemical models, and lots of other stuff.

   The Principal Investigator for this project is Dr. Charles McClain.
   There are a number of Co-PI's, other staff and students involved. To
