      USAID's Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean has the lead role in
      administering U.S. reconstruction funds as a result of over $8 billion
      in 1998 hurricane damage for countries in Central America and the
      Caribbean. Activities focus primarily on economic recovery,
      transportation, public health, disaster mitigation, watershed
      management, housing, and schools. Striving to "build-back-better," the
      activities are premised on community participation and international
      donor coordination.

      In May 1999, Congress appropriated $621 million under the Emergency
      Supplemental Appropriations Act. The funds primarily support the
      reconstruction of countries devastated by two hurricanes in late 1998,
      but also to respond to the Colombia earthquake of January 1999.
      Hurricane Georges struck the Eastern Caribbean, the Dominican Republic
      and Haiti in August, 1998. Hurricane Mitch hit Central America in
      October 1998 with an impact consistent with the kind of hurricane that
      emerges only once in a 100-200 year period. Later, Congress supported
      the use of these funds to help reconstruction in the Bahamas which was
      struck by Hurricane Floyd in July 1999 and additional reconstruction in
      the Eastern Caribbean which was struck by Hurricane Lenny in November
      1999. This appropriation created a special account called the Central
      American and Caribbean Emergency Disaster Recovery Funds (CACEDRF).

      The materials contained in this website relate primarily to the use of
      the $621 million CACEDRF funds, though there are references in these
      materials to additional U.S. funds: nearly $400 million in emergency
      assistance provided immediately after the disasters by the USAID Office
      of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the U.S. Department of Defense
      (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and another $80
      million reprogrammed by USAID from existing resources. In sum, the U.S.
      Government is providing over $1.1 billion as our share of the
      international efforts to assist the countries of Central America and
      the Caribbean recover from the disasters of 1998 and 1999. Moreover,
      USAID was successful in attracting U.S. architectural/engineering firms
      to design and oversee the construction of the extensive road and
      municipal water system activities.

      USAID administers $586.8 million of the $621 million CACEDRF funds,
      including $62.5 million in partnership with the following U.S.
      agencies: National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within
      the Department of Commerce, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal
      Emergency Management Agency, USDA, U.S. Geological Survey within the
      Department of Interior, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      within the Department of Health and Human Services. The remaining $34.3
      million of the appropriation is administered by the Department of
      Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Peace Corps,
      Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the
      Department of State, and the General Accounting Office. The funds will
      be fully expended by December 31, 2001.

      This website permits the reader to follow the progress under this
      program, access key documents authorizing the program, and see related
      ad hoc materials as they become available.

      USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance is responsible for
      immediate response and humanitarian relief following disasters.
      Information on the January 2001 earthquake in El Salvador can be found
      on OFDA's website.
