   The LBNL Windows and Daylighting Group has extensive experience with
   highly insulating windows that use gas fills and multiple layers of
   glazing materials. An outgrowth of this research is the development of
   an opaque thermal insulation technology known as Gas-Filled Panels.
   Gas-Filled Panels, or GFPs, use thin polymer films and low-conductivity
   gas to create a device with extraordinary thermal insulation
   properties. GFPs are essentially hermetic plastic bags that can take on
   a variety of shapes and sizes. Inside the outer barrier is a cellular
   structure called a baffle. Argon gas filling provides an effective
   thermal resistance level of R-7 per inch, krypton gas provides R-12.5
   per inch, and xenon gas provides R-20 per inch.
