Research Activities of OASG

   Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Group carries out studies directly
   related to three DOE activities: the Ocean Margins Program (OMP); the
   Ocean Research Program (ORP); and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement
   Program (ARM). The OMP contributes to DOE climate change research by
   quantifying the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, burial
   and isolation in sediments, and export to the deep ocean. The secondary
   goals of the OMP are to quantify the mechanisms and processes by which
   carbon dioxide is assimilated, transported and transformed in the
   coastal ocean, in order to define ocean-margin sources and sinks in
   global biogeochemical cycles. Research within OASG focuses of the
   production, transformation, and transport of particulate organic carbon
   in the open water and sediments of the continental margins. These
   biological, chemical and physical investigations are required to
   determine the quantitative significance of continental shelves in
   sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide. One objective of the ORP is to
   conduct a global survey of carbon dioxide in the ocean. OASG developed
   the instrumentation to make the measurements and also participates in
   survey expeditions. The ARM program is scheduled to establish five
   major sites at which to make measurements and to conduct experiments in
   order to improve the treatment of radiative transfer and cloud effects
   in climate models. Two of these sites are managed by OASG.
