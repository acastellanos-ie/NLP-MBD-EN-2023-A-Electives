     Olympic Coast Marine Sanctuary covers 3,310-square miles of marine
     waters off the rugged Olympic Peninsula coastline. The sanctuary
     provides habitat for one of the most diverse marine mammal faunas in
     North America and a critical link in the Pacific flyway. The
     sanctuary boasts a rich mix of cultures, preserved in contemporary
     lives of members of Quinault, Hoh, Quileute, and Makah tribes.


   Common Murres by Fred Sharpe
   Common Murres nest on only a few of the coastal islands within Olympic
   Coast National Marine Sanctuary. More than 600 islands in the Sanctuary
   provide important breeding grounds for birds and marine mammals. The
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages these off-shore islands.
