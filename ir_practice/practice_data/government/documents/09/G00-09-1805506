   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Dr. Nancy Foster
   Scholarship Program recognizes outstanding scholarship and encourages
   independent graduate level research -- particularly by female and
   minority students -- in oceanography, marine biology and maritime
   archaeology. Congress authorized the Program, as described in the
   National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-513),
   soon after Dr. Foster's death in June 2000, as a means of honoring her
   lifes work and contribution to the nation. The program is administered
   through NOAAs National Ocean Service and funded annually with 1% of
   the amount appropriated each fiscal year to carry out the National
   Marine Sanctuaries Act.
