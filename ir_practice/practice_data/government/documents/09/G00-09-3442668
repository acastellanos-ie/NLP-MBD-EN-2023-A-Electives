   The CD/SA Department is involved with both the CDF and DØ experiments.
   We are involved with various software development efforts, working
   towards the beginning of data collection for Run II of the Tevatron.

   Our group is part of the Fermilab Computing Division, and consists of
   two members, Jim Kowalkowski and Marc Paterno.
