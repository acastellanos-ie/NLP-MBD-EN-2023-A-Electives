    The mission of the NOAA High Performance Computing and Communications
   (HPCC) program is to accelerate the adoption of advanced computing,
   communications and information technology throughout NOAA so that the
   agency can accomplish its mission better and in a more cost-effective
   way.

   To do this the program supports acquisition of advanced platforms for
   high-end research computing, research on advanced programming
   techniques for some of the world's fastest computers, development and
   deployment of advanced networking technologies, and application of
   advanced information technologies to NOAA's missions.
