   Warm Season Grasses in a Conservation Buffer - Photo by Tim Dunne, NRCS
   BUFFERS ARE BEAUTIFUL!!

   Conservation buffers are areas or strips of land maintained in
   permanent vegetation that are designed to intercept pollutants. They
   can reduce erosion, enhance wildlife habitat, and improve water quality
   -- and, yes, they are beautiful!  NRCS conservationists, in providing
   technical assistance for the design of this buffer, recommended a
   native grass seed mix to provide optimum wildlife habitat. The buffer
   is filtering runoff from the cropland and protecting the stream and a
   wetland downslope of this field.
