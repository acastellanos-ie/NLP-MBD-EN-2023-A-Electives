   The Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, establishes the
   responsibilities and duties of an IG. The IG Act was amended throughout
   the 1980s to increase the number of agencies with statutory IGs,
   culminating in 1988 with the establishment of IGs in smaller,
   independent agencies. There are now 57 statutory IGs.

   There are two IG councils. The President's Council on Integrity and
   Efficiency (PCIE) and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency
   (ECIE). The PCIE has 6 committees, Audit, Inspection and Evaluation,
   Investigations, Integrity, Legislation and Professional Development as
   well as several related organizations. The ECIE is represented on each
   of the committees.
