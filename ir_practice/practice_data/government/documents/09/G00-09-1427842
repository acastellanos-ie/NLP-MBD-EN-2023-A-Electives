                  Overview and Current Research Directions

    For many years, the research group of U.C. Berkeley Professor Joseph
    Cerny has been studying the production and properties of isotopes at
    the extreme limits of nuclear stability.  By examining such nuclides,
      insight may be gained into the forces governing the nucleus.  The
      interplay  of these forces is reflected in subtle changes in the
   structure of isotopes increasingly far from beta stability.  New decay
     modes become energetically possible among very proton-rich nuclides
   which are not observable closer to stability.  In addition to providing
   a means of measuring nuclear properties, the decay modes themselves are
    also of interest.  Measurements of the production and decay of exotic
   nuclei may be compared with the predictions of theorists as a means of
              testing nuclear models under extreme conditions.

     Although part of the Berkeley College of Chemistry, the Cerny Group
      labs and offices are housed at nearby Lawrence Berkeley National
      Laboratory.  Most experiments are performed using LBNL's 88-Inch
      Cyclotron, a National User Facility.  The cyclotron is capable of
    accelerating many different ions from hydrogen to uranium to energies
     ranging from a few MeV to about one GeV.  Under the auspices of the
       BEARS initiative, the Cerny Group is leading an effort to make
        radioactive ion beams available for use by researchers at the
    cyclotron.  In addition, the "88" is home to several user facilities,
   including the Berkeley Gas-Filled Spectrometer (BGS), and Gammasphere,
                 a high-efficiency gamma-ray detector array.
