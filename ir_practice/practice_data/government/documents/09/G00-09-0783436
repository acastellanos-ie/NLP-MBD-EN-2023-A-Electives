    Aloha and Welcome to the Nation's Twelfth National Marine Sanctuary!

                     The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale
   National Marine Sanctuary was established in 1997 to protect the North
            Pacific population of the endangered humpback whale.



Events and Announcements

                                                          whale breaching

     Whale watchers should scan the surface of the water, whether from the
                shore or a boat, for breaching, blows or unusual activity.

   THEY'RE BACK!

   The summer sped by as the Sanctuary anxiously awaited this year's
   humpback whale season in Hawai`i. Our winter residents typically begin
   arriving in the islands from as early as September, with the peak
   season occurring between January and February. By March, whale
   sightings in the islands begin to decline as the whales make their way
   back to their Alaskan summer feeding grounds. This year, the season
   seemed to get off to a belated start when the first whale sighting was
   reported in late October.

   To learn about the various humpback whale behaviors that you might see
   during their stay in the Hawaiian Islands, click here.

   For more information about upcoming sanctuary activities during the
   whale season, see our calendar of events.


   SANCTUARY OCEAN COUNT

   The 2001 Sanctuary Ocean Count was a big success this year. Our
   1000-plus volunteers had a "whale" of a time counting the giant mammals
   from the shores of O`ahu, Kaua`i and the Big Island. For articles and
   photos of the day's events, click here.

   Planning for the 2002 Sanctuary Ocean Count is currently underway. For
   more information about the upcoming events, click here.


   SANCTUARY PHOTOGRAPHS

   Our photo collection is very popular. An enhanced photo gallery of the
   sanctuary, with photos selected by sanctuary staff is now available.

A Note about Language

   The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary
   recognizes the rich markings of the Hawaiian language and has made
   every effort to include them here. However, the limitations of common
   fonts have prevented many of these markings from appearing. The
   sanctuary will continue to remain sensitive to the Hawaiian language
   and will include these markings wherever possible.
