Introduction

   Argonne National Laboratory is a Department of Energy (DOE)
   multi-program laboratory with a 50-year heritage in nuclear reactor
   research and development, dating back to Enrico Fermi and CP-1. Design
   and development work on HWRs, PWRs, BWRs, and LMRs has been done at
   Argonne over the years. Argonne maintains a comprehensive staff
   expertise in nuclear reactor technology, along with state-of-the-art
   computer and experimental facilities. Nuclear reactor work at Argonne
   is concentrated in the Engineering Research Directorate, of which the
   Reactor Engineering Division is a part.

   The Division is responsible for a wide spectrum of technology
   development programs that require the integration of engineering
   disciplines to carry projects through from inception to construction
   and testing. Expertise, experience and facilities that are available
   include system planning, design, computer simulation, modeling,
   analysis, experimentation, and production of engineering prototypes and
   components. In addition to its work in nuclear technology, Reactor
   Engineering has actively participated in applying its core competencies
   to programs in other fields of nuclear and non-nuclear technology.
   Reactor Engineering has successfully integrated its own resources with
   those of other divisions so that the entire technical resources of
   Argonne can be focused on the needs of the customer.
