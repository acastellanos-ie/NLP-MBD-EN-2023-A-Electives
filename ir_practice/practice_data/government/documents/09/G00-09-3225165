   "Promoting Ability Within USDA"

   USDA will make reasonable accommodations for the removal of workplace
   barriers to the  known physical or mental limitations of qualified
   applicants for employment and employees with disabilities, unless such
   accommodations would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the
   Department's activities and/or programs. It is the Department's policy
   to serve as a model employer of persons with disabilities and to
   accommodate employees and applicants with disabilities.

   The attached enforcement guidance
   (http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/accommodation.html)
   allows managers and supervisors to provide more than the minimum
   requirements whenever feasible, including accommodating individuals
   whose functional limitations do not rise to the definition of a
   "disability." USDA recognizes that all of its employees need the tools
   necessary to be productive, and that making reasonable accommodations
   is simply a way of providing the tools needed to accomplish its
   mission. USDA is committed to a simple and streamlined process for
   providing reasonable accommodations.


                    The Department's guiding principle is
                        "When in doubt, accommodate!"


     ^The goal of the Secretary's Advisory Committee for Employees with
     Disabilities (SACED) is to enable USDA to achieve equitable
     consistent, Department-wide policies and systems that provide equal
     access and reasonable accommodations where employees with
     disabilities are treated fairly, with dignity and respect, and
     to establish USDA as an employer of choice.
