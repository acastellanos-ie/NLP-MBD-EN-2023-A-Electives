   About the House Policy Committee: The Policy Committee is the House
   majority’s principal forum for discussion of specific legislative
   initiatives, for the enunciation of official Republican priorities on
   issues, and for the resolution of inter-jurisdictional policy disputes
   within the Conference.

   The Policy Committee serves other important functions as well. When
   important legislation is reported from committee, and before it reaches
   the floor, it is vital that House majority views be aired and
   reconciled. The responsibility of the Policy Committee is to promote
   discussion and understanding of our committee bills across the entire
   Conference, thereby enhancing opportunities to enact the legislation.

   In addition, the Policy Committee is an important means for every
   member of the Conference to develop sound legislative ideas into sound
   bills. These bills can then be introduced and considered in the
   appropriate committee of jurisdiction. The Policy Committee offers a
   unique opportunity for participation by members whose legislative ideas
   do not in every case coincide with their committee assignments, as well
   as an especially useful mechanism for addressing important issues that
   cut across committee jurisdictions.

   Many issues that call for a clear statement of majority policy are not
   properly addressed (or cannot be timely addressed) by legislation. The
   Policy Committee--with a combined membership of 20 percent of the
   Conference, including leadership, key committee chairmen, and both
   class and regional representatives--is uniquely well suited to issue
   such statements after careful deliberation and opportunity for all
   Members to be heard.

   Through its Policy Advisory Boards, the Policy Committee conducts a
   regular liaison with the nation’s leading think tanks, scholars, and
   private-sector experts on the issues before the Congress. Regular
   meetings of the Policy Advisory Boards and the House Leadership provide
   an important forum for the advancement of our knowledge of the issues
   and a key opportunity for the development of sound policy and
   legislative initiatives.
