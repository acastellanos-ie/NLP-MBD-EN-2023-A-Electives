                               Research Areas
    MSEL's work is grouped into six major categories, described below. A
           more complete listing of research areas is given here.

     primary bullet Ceramics: conducts programs pertinent to measurement
   issues for ceramic materials through fundamental and applied research,
     the development of standard test methodologies, the preparation of
    standard reference materials, and the evaluation and dissemination of
                          standard reference data.

   primary bullet Materials Reliability: develops measurement technologies
      which enable the producers and users of materials to improve the
                 quality and reliability of their products.

   primary bullet Polymers: provides scientific knowledge, consulting, and
       other expertise to US industries which use or produce polymers,
                            plastics, or rubber.

        primary bullet Metallurgy: develops measurement and standards
       infrastructure for US industry and the nation with expertise in
   electrochemical processing, magnetic materials, materials performance,
   materials structure and characterization, and metallurgical processing.

        NIST Center for Neutron Research: offers advanced measurement
        capabilities for use by all qualified applicants. Many of its
      instruments rely on intense neutron beams emanating from a liquid
                  hydrogen moderator near the reactor core.

      primary bullet Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials
      Science: investigates important problems in materials theory and
   modeling with novel computational approaches; creates opportunities for
    collaboration where CTCMS can make a positive difference by virtue of
      its structure, focus, and people; develops powerful new tools for
     materials theory and modeling and accelerate their integration into
                            industrial research.
