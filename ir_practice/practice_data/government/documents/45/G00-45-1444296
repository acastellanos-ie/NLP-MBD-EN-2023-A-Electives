   #973 Statistical Analysis of Microarray Data

   Description:

   This course will provide an overview of statistical issues that arise
   in the design and analysis of microarray studies. The course will begin
   with a discussion of the various sources of variability inherent in
   microarray experiments, methods of evaluating data quality, and data
   normalization techniques. Focus will then shift to outlining the main
   types of scientific questions that investigators aim to answer from
   microarray experiments, accompanied by an in depth discussion of proper
   design and analysis strategies for addressing each of the specific
   types of questions. The afternoon session will be a "hands-on"
   demonstration of BRB Array Tools. This microarray data analysis
   software package will be used to demonstrate and reinforce some of the
   concepts discussed in the morning session.

   Objectives:

   Topics to be covered include:
     * Sources of variability in array experiments
     * Data quality assessment
     * Data normalization
     * Analysis and visualization methods
     * Clustering methods
     * Class prediction methods
     * Permutation tests
     * Multiple comparisons procedures
     * ANOVA models

   Who should attend:

   CIT course #972 mAdb Basic Informatics Class is a prerequisite;
   priority will be given to those using NCI's Advanced Technology Center
   (ATC), FDA/CBER, and NIAID microarray prints. Others interested in
   advanced microarray analysis as space permits.
