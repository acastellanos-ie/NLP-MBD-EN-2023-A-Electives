    2. What is the special-needs NOAA Weather Radio?

     * The special-needs NOAA Weather Radio has recently been designed to
       adapt to the needs of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
     * The Radio can warn deaf and hard-of-hearing persons of hazardous
       conditions, giving them around-the-clock, up-to-the-minute weather
       information.
     * The Radio is a weather alerting system that can be a lifesaver,
       much as the now commonly-used smoke detector with flashing light,
       for deaf and hard-of-hearing persons.

    3. What are the weather alerting needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons?

     * Visual and vibrating alarms and simple text readouts are provided.
     * Three warning lights indicate level of alert (Statement, Watch, or
       Warning).
     * Liquid crystal display readout indicates specific warning such as
       "Tornado Warning" or "Thunderstorm Warning", etc.
     * Programmable state/county selections screen out warnings for other
       areas.
     * Accessible technology, now being developed, will enable deaf and
       hard-of-hearing persons to obtain NOAA Weather Radio alert messages
       in text format.
     * The battery-operated NOAA Weather Radio can be portable at home,
       work, school or play, or while traveling, boating or camping.
     * For deaf-blind persons and hearing-impaired persons with
       low-vision, special-needs NOAA Weather Radio receivers may be
       equipped with special adaptions which convert the weather messages
       into large print and/or Braille version without depending on
       volunteering reading services.

    4. What does the special-needs NOAA Weather Radio do in times of inclement
    weather?

     * When an alert is broadcast on the NOAA Weather Radio, it will send
       a signal which then activates one of the following accessories:
          + Pillow vibrator to wake individuals from sleep.
          + Strobe light to alert individuals during waking hours.
          + Bed shaker to shake a bed to wake individuals up.

    6. In addition to using the Radio, deaf and hard-of-hearing persons should
    educate themselves on weather safety. Where can they learn weather safety?

     * Weather safety education is highly recommended for deaf and
       hard-of-hearing persons to understand basic weather knowledge. This
       education is vital in preparing them to respond properly to weather
       threats. Contact your local National Weather Service office, your
       state emergency management agency, the Federal Emergency Management
       Agency, or your American Red Cross chapter that may help you with
       the following:

            weather hazards.
          + Familiarize yourself with weather warnings.
          + Attend safety talks.
