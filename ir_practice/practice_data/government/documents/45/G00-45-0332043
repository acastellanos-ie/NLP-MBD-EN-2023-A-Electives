             Welcome to the USGS Surface Water Information Pages

     The Office of Surface Water provides leadership in development and
    application of new techniques and tools for the collection, analysis
           and interpretation of surface-water and sediment data.

             11/19/99 Streamflow Information for the New Century

PROGRAMS USGS offices in every State conduct surface-water studies in
         cooperation with local and State governments, and with other Federal
         Agencies. Contacts are available in each state to assist with any
         questions. Information also is available for the following National
         Programs: National Flood Frequency Program; National Bridge Scour
         Project; National Streamgaging Program; Global Change Hydrology Program
         (Hydroclimatology) and Watershed and River System Management Program.

   PUBLICATIONS Information about surface-water resources of the Nation,
   including floods and droughts and other streamflow characteristics are
   available through Abstract Search and other USGS Publications and USGS
   Fact Sheets .

   DATA The USGS collects, analyzes, archives, and disseminates data and
        information describing the surface-water resources of the Nation.
        Historical daily streamflows and suspended-sediment data are available
        for many of the Nation's rivers and streams. Real-time river stage and
        discharge data are available for more than 3000 rivers and streams.

   EQUIPMENT & FACILITIES The USGS operates a Hydraulics Laboratory for
   the testing of instrument and doing hydraulic and sediment transport
   research. The Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility and the Federal
   Interagency Sedimentation Project develop, test, and distribute various
   measurement and sampling equipment.

            Need information about USGS surface-water techniques?

   TECHNIQUES Information is available on techniques related to watershed
   modeling, flood and low-flow frequency, hydraulics modeling, sediment
   transport, bridge scour and instrumentation. Various application tools,
   including watershed and hydraulic models also are available.

SPECIAL TOPICS The USGS participates in many different projects and
               forums for addressing special topics related to the surface-water
               resources of the Nation.

   OTHER SOURCES The USGS is part of the community of surface-water
   scientists. Community groups, scientific and professional societies,
   State Agencies, and other Federal Agencies are additional sources of
   information about surface water.
