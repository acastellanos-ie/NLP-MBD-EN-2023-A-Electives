     What's New

     The California High-Speed Rail Authority (Authority) is the state
     entity responsible for planning, constructing, and operating a
     high-speed train system serving California's major metropolitan
     areas. The Authority has a nine-member policy board and a small core
     staff. All environmental, planning, and engineering work is
     performed by private firms under contract with the Authority.

     The Authority is preparing a program-level Environmental Impact
     Report (EIR)/Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a 700-mile
     high-speed train system serving Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay
     Area, the Central Valley, Los Angeles, the Inland Empire, Orange
     County and San Diego. High-speed trains would be capable of maximum
     speed of at least 200 miles per hour with an expected trip time from
     San Francisco to Los Angeles in 2 hours and 30 minutes. The
     Authority is the lead state agency for the state EIR, and the
     Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is the lead federal agency for
     the federal EIS. The Authority and the FRA have jointly completed a
     scoping process and have evaluated numerous options for routes and
     stations.

     On January 10, 2002 Governor Davis proposed $8.46 million for the
     2002-3 fiscal year to the Authority, which combined with the $1.25
     in a federal appropriation the Authority received last month, makes
     it possible for the Authority to prepare the draft program EIR/EIS
     by June 30, 2003. Governor Davis also appointed two prominent
     Californians to the Authority, Dr. Ernest A. Bates, CEO of American
     Shared Hospital Services in San Francisco, and Joseph E. Petrillo, a
     partner in the San Francisco law office of Sheppard Mullin Richter
     and Hampton.

     At the January 16, 2002, Authority meeting in Sacramento,
     presentations were made on the conclusions of the "Tunneling Summit"
     conference that was held in December to gain insight regarding the
     feasibility, construction methods, and costs associated with
     tunneling in California's mountain passes, and on the results of the
     alignment refinements that were done on the mountain pass route
     alternatives using the "Quantm" optimization software. The Authority
     approved staff recommendations for the first screening of
     alternatives for the Sacramento-Bakersfield region (First Screening
     Report-Part 2). The Authority also approved revised staff
     recommendations for the San Jose-Merced and Bakersfield-Sylmar
     segments screening (Revisions to Mountain Crossings
     Recommendations), and the Los Angeles Union Station to Los Angeles
     International Airport and Mira Mesa to San Diego segments (Revisions
     to First Screening Report-Part 1). The Secretary of Business,
     Housing and Transportation Agency, Maria Contreras-Sweet, strongly
     reiterated Governor Davis's support for the high-speed train program
     and State Senator Jim Costa pledged continued support from the
     Legislature.

     The approval of the First Screening Reports is a major milestone in
     the program-level EIR/EIS process. The Authority has greatly reduced
     the number of alignments, station locations and types of high-speed
     trains to be further investigated. Maglev technology has been
     eliminated from further investigation since it would prohibit direct
     high-speed train service to San Francisco, SFO and the San Francisco
     Peninsula. Maglev would also eliminate the potential use of the Los
     Angeles-San Diego (LOSSAN) rail alignment for a direct connection
     between LA Union Station and Orange County. From Irvine to San
     Diego, only non-electrified steel-wheel-on-steel-rail high-speed
     train technology will be further investigated - the I-15 corridor
     via the Inland Empire will provide direct, "electrified" high-speed
     train service from San Diego to Central and Northern California.

     The next Authority meetings will be held on February 20, 2002 in San
     Diego and March 20, 2002 in San Francisco.
