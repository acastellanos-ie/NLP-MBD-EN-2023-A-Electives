                 Administrative Processes, Budget, Planning,
              Human Resource Management & EEO, Public Affairs,
             Information Management and Database Administration.

      OMI coordinates the development of advice to the Regional Administrator
      (RA) on the selection and priority of Region-wide program goals,
      objectives, and measures of accomplishment; and, monitors the use of human
      and fiscal resources and provides advice to the RA on the most effective
      and efficient use thereof. Coordinates all regional planning
      (strategic/other) and development efforts, ensuring that the appropriate
      internal and external stakeholders are involved.

   Provides advice and assistance on human resource management guidance
   and requirements (NOAA Human Resources link). Coordinates
   administrative operations; region-wide infrastructure issues; policy
   development; diversity; and prepares/maintains current Regional
   organization charts, functional statements, and staffing plans.

   OMI is responsible for all Southeast Region's strategic, operational
   and financial planning activities, particularly with respect to
   interpreting headquarters policy guidance and applying it to long-range
   planning activities. OMI coordinates policy advice from regional
   program managers and keeps abreast of major NOAA/NMFS policy directives
   to advise the RA on potential policy conflicts. It serves as the formal
   planning link to the Southeast Fisheries Science Center to ensure that
   research activities are predominantly addressing management information
   needs. Additionally, joint evaluations and reports are coordinated. OMI
   identifies, evaluates, and provides resolution to problems brought to
   its attention from internal and external sources. End products could
   result in new or modified program initiatives and impact on current
   year operating plans.

   Budget responsibilities include formulating out-year budgets, executing
   the current year budget and evaluating prior year performance from a
   budgetary perspective (these tasks include coordination of the
   Southeast Fisheries Science Center and Fishery Management Councils'
   budgets); preparation of Financial Operating Plan (FOP); insuring
   SERO's data in the NMFS-wide Financial Reporting System (FRS) is
   current and accurate (data entry, error corrections related to data
   transfer from FIMA, report generation and review); and keeping the RA
   apprised of budget situation.

   OMI provides the following administrative services: procurement;
   payment authorizations; property management; space utilization; time
   and attendance processing (support to timekeepers and
   combining/transmission of data); office supply and equipment leasing
   and maintenance; mail distribution; reproduction services for printed
   material; and telephone systems.

   OMI is responsible for regional information resource management matters
   including planning, technical standards, security and network
   operations. Close working relationships with HQs Information Management
   Division is necessary to insure adherence to national standards and
   provides input in formulation of requirements. Information management
   services encompass: procurement of software and hardware (including
   justification of funds, preparation of specifications, review of bids,
   and receipt of equipment); computer support, including installation,
   trouble-shooting, and repair of software and hardware; training; and
   technical guidance to users in the formulation of requirements. OMI
   also provides database management support for real-time databases such
   as vessel and dealer fisheries permits, grants and contracts
   monitoring, and habitat alteration project tracking. This includes
   system analysis and design; software program development; program
   revisions and maintenance; documentation preparation; and completion of
   various data entry, edit, and retrieval functions.

   OMI coordinates public information outreach locally by working closely
   with NMFS's HQs Public Affairs Officer (SERO Public Affairs Officer)
   and/or NOAA's Office of Public and Constituent Affairs. OMI is charged
   with planning, organizing, and carrying out an intensive public
   information effort involving sensitive and highly controversial
   national interest issues. OMI arranges and oversees participatory
   public meetings to communicate the Service's goals and policies,
   facilitate the understanding and acceptance of its programs, and
   provides key NMFS officials with feedback to reach needed decisions.
