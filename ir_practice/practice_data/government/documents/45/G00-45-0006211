   "First, in the post-attack economy, some workers need more help for
   more time. So I propose extending the unemployment benefits by 13 weeks
   in states that have been hardest hit by job losses related to the
   September 11th attack. This emergency extension will be paid entirely
   by federal dollars and should remain in place for 18 months.

   And, secondly, I believe the best way to help people meet health care
   needs, or job training needs, or income support, is to fund the
   National Emergency Grant System by an additional $3 billion. This will
   be federal money that will go to states so they can distribute monies
   directly to people whose lives have been affected."

   President George W. Bush, October 5, 2001
