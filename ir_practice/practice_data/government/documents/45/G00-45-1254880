   Java Farms Processing System Control Interface

      The jFPSCI v2.3 is now out.

   What's New ?

     changed server to omniORB, improved stability

     just one server module

     plus many bugfixes

Requirements:

     Java Runtime Environment 1.3

     Java Web Start

   After succesfully downloading above packages just click on the links
   below :
   [jfpsci_console1.jpg]
   Launch java Farms Processing Control Interface [v 2.3 for Windows]
   Launch java Farms Processing Control Interface [v 2.3 for Linux]
   Launch java Farms Processing Control Interface [v 2.1 for Windows]
   Launch java Farms Processing Control Interface [v 2.1 for Linux]

   For the users with slow network you can still start the package
   classical way , please follow the link to download the jFPSCI_2_3.jar.
   Also if you want to submit a bug ,be sure that it's not already listed
   below. If you're using Web Start in order to submit a bug you will have
   to setup a Java Console to be able to view the debug output (please run
   javaws go to preferrences and check open java console.

   A draft of the help is available here.This help is also accessible
   using the application menu [Help/Introduction].
   jFPS Monitoring Interface API [development documentation] is available.
README:
Server dependencies :
PyXML-0.6.3.i386.rpm - XML parser API (SAX,DOM) for python
ftp://ftp.dstc.edu.au/DSTC/fnorb/fnorb-1.1.tar.gz - CORBA API for python
[ rpm exists and port to SGI is in place , please mail if you need more
information]

after installing required packages:
tar -xzvf jFPSCI-server.0.x.tar.gz
tar -xzvf jFPSMI-server.xx.tar.gz
both servers need a FARMS_CONTROL_CONFIG_DIR and FARMS_CONTROL_DIR to be
setup [ for cdffarm1 this is done by source farms_setup.csh]
To run the servers:
cd jFPSCI-server/python server.py --log log_file --OAport=xxxx
Setting the OAport is necessary to allow reconnection if the server crashes.
(Must be the same port for every startup)
cd jFPSMI-server/python MonitorIDaemon.py --log log_file


to setup authentication edit the file jfpsci.passwd and then
type : python passwd.py username(as defined in jfpsci.passwd)  to change user
password one can also change password using the client ,
feature.

if you want to change the port for the authentication module use: --port xxxx

The client needs Java Runtime Environment 1.3 or above ,
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/
Java Web Start v 1.0 - to enable web start
http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/javawebstart-platform.sh?

For the users without Java Web Start please type:
/usr/java/jdk1.3.0_01/bin/java -jar jFPSCI_xx.jar --host IORserver
(change the path to your jdk1.3 path)

For the users with Web Start just follow the link : http://fnpcc.fnal.gov/jfpsci
