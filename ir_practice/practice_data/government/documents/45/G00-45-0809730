                  Farm Income Forecast Farm Income Forecast
    Forecasting farm income requires knowledge of both the economy on the
   farm and the economies of rural areas in which farm families live. More
     than ever, government payments are a key factor in farm incomes, so
   knowing who gets payments and at what levels is critical. Recent levels
      of government payments-both legislated and emergency-have helped
   sustain farmland values and farm equity, preserving wealth in the farm
                                   sector.

       Agricultural Outlook Forum 2002 Agricultural Outlook Forum 2002
   The Forum will provide an overview of agricultural prospects and issues
    in a compact two-day format. Government officials, industry analysts,
      and farmers will assess farm prospects for the year ahead. Focus
     sessions will highlight major developments changing the business of
   agriculture. Attendees will receive new long-term commodity projections
                              prepared by USDA.

        Agricultural R&D And Technology Adoption Agricultural R&D And
                             Technology Adoption
   Both at home and abroad, the driving force behind agricultural research
   agenda-setting is now growth in private sector R&D. While the level of
      public funding for research has leveled off since the mid-1980s,
    private research expenditures, bolstered by strengthened intellectual
      property rights, tripled in real terms between 1960 and 1996 and
   continue to grow. Research priorities are also affected by the shift in
     focus toward the agricultural inputs supply industries particularly
     biotechnology. These trends influence the development of technology
       available to producers and the pace at which that technology is
    adopted. ERS is at the forefront of economic research on agricultural
     R&D and its effects on the adoption of production technologies. The
              reports featured here add to that knowledge base.

      FoodReview: Examining the Well-Being of Children, Vol. 24, No. 2
     The theme for this issue of FoodReview is ''America's Children.'' A
      series of articles discuss the well-being of America's children,
   children's diet quality, the problem of overweight children in America,
    foodborne disease among children, the economics of breastfeeding, and
      food assistance programs that help children and their families. A
      special article discusses U.S. consumption of tree nuts. Another
       special article looks at food availability and affordability in
                               Washington, DC.

          Food and Agricultural Policy Food and Agricultural Policy
   Designed to take a longer term view of our Nation's agriculture & food
    system and offer constructive ideas to help guide future farm policy,
     this report examines the enormous changes faced by today's food and
      farm system, as well as the lessons learned from more than seven
        decades of food and farm policies. The report offers a set of
   principles to guide policy development for the futureaddressing issues
    such as trade, a farm safety net, system infrastructure, conservation
   and environment, rural communities, nutrition and food assistance, and
                          program delivery systems.

    Urban development, land use, and agriculture Urban development, land
                            use, and agriculture
   Land quite literally underlies all economic activity, but nowhere more
   than for agriculture. Land is the primary input for crop production and
    grazing livestock, a source of rural amenities, and a store of value
      for farmland owners. Continuing a long and rich tradition of ERS
    research on land use and values, we present new products probing the
      issue of "sprawl" and its impact on farming in the city's shadow.

                     Manure management Manure management
    Livestock and poultry manure applied to farmland is a valuable source
    of organic nutrients, but manure nitrogen and phosphorus in excess of
       the farm's crop requirements can compromise water quality. Many
      confined animal operations are unable to use all manure nutrients
       produced on land under their control. This has prompted concern
      commensurate with the increasing concentration of animal feeding
      operations, which also tend to be specialized and thus have less
      cropland on which to apply manure. A new report, Confined Animal
      Production and Manure Nutrients, uses survey data to estimate the
     number of confined animals, the amount of manure nutrients, and the
           capacity of nearby land to assimilate these nutrients.

     Global Food Consumption and Trade Global Food Consumption and Trade
       Higher income, urbanization, other demographic shifts, improved
    transportation, and consumer perceptions regarding quality and safety
        are changing global food consumption patterns. Shifts in food
   consumption have led to increased trade and changes in the composition
    of world agricultural trade. Given different diets, food expenditure
     and food budget responses to income and price changes vary between
                     developing and developed countries.

   Discussions in the public arena have raised fundamental questions about

    government assistance to agriculture based on the concept of ensuring
                      some minimum standard of living.
