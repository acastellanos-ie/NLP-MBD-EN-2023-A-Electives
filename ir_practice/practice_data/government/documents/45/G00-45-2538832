   What is a DOQ?
   An aerial photograph and an orthophoto or orthoimage may look alike but
   there are several important differences that allow an orthophoto to be
   used like a map. A conventional perspective aerial photograph contains
   image distortions caused by the tilting of the camera and terrain
   relief (topography). It does not have a uniform scale. You cannot
   measure distances on an aerial photograph like you can on a map. An
   aerial photo is not a map. The effects of tilt and relief are removed
   from the aerial photograph by a mathematical process called
   rectification. An orthophoto is a uniform-scale image. Since an
   orthophoto has a uniform scale, it is possible to measure directly on
   it like other maps. An orthophoto may serve as a base map onto which
   other map information may be overlaid. DOQ Example (image)

   A DOQ can be used on-screen to collect, review, and revise other
   digital data, especially digital line graphs (DLG) and topographic
   maps. When the DOQ is combined with other digital products, such as
   digital raster graphics (DRG) or digital elevation models (DEM), the
   resulting image provides additional visual information for the
   extraction and revision of base cartographic information.

   How to Obtain DOQs
     * From the USGS
       The USGS distributes uncompressed DOQs on Compact Disc-Recordable
       (CD-R). Either Geotiff or native format can be specified. DOQ
       orders are filled on demand. There is a base charge of $45.00 per
       order, plus $5.00 shipping, plus $7.50 for each black and white
       (grayscale) 3.75 x 3.75 DOQ purchased or $15.00 for each color DOQ.
       Any combination of files can be ordered.
       For information on ordering DOQs on CD-R, contact any Earth Science
       Information Center or call 1-888-ASK-USGS, toll free. You may also
       order DOQs online from the USGS Earth Explorer Web Site
     * Viewing DOQs online
       A cooperative research project with Microsoft and USGS allows
       viewing of DOQs online at Microsoft's Terraserver. Small portions
       of DOQs can be directly downloaded from the Terraserver site.
     * From USGS Business Partners - Not all of the Business Partners on
       this list offer DOQs. Please go to their respective web sites or
       contact them directly for availability and pricing information.
