   arrow Quick Tips and Examples
         Just type in a few words or phrases. Try to use discriminating terms
         that are likely to be found only in the documents you seek. The more
         words you give, the better results you'll get. Here are some examples:

         Search by typing words and phrases.

           Human Resource Management Technology Council Performance Report

         Search will find documents containing as many of these words and
         phrases as possible, ranked so that the documents most relevant to your
         query are presented first. Don't worry about missing a document because
         it doesn't have one of the words in your search -- Search returns
         relevant results even if they don't contain all query terms.

         Identify phrases with quotation marks, separate with commas.

           Human Resource Management, "Technology Council", "Performance
           Report"

         A phrase is entered using double quotation marks, and only matches
         those words which appear adjacent to each other. Separate multiple
         phrases or proper names with a comma.

         Use UPPER case to indicate exact match.

           Theodore Roosevelt, TRB

         Search terms in lowercase will match words in any case, otherwise, an
         exact case match is used. For example, trb will find matches for trb,
         TRB, and trb, whereas a query for TRB will only match TRB.
