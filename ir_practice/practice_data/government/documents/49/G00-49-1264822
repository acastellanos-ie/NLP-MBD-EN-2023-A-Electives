Mars

   HST image of Mars
   Images Suggest Recent Sources of Liquid Water on Mars
          Gullies seen on martian cliffs and crater walls in a small
          number of high-resolution images from the Mars Global Surveyor
          (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) suggest that liquid water has
          seeped onto the surface in the geologically recent past.

   On the Question of the Mars Meteorite
          An excellent summary of the scientific evidence and reasoning
          which led to the conclusion that life once existed on Mars.

   Global Climate Change on Mars
          Evidence from past robotic missions to Mars has revealed that
          the planet almost certainly has undergone several severe climate
          changes in its history. Water has run over the Martian surface
          at more than one geological time, and oceans may have also been
          formed. This article discusses the evidence of climate changes
          particularly with regard to the presence of liquid water.

   The Center for Mars Exploration
          CMEX is a new site at NASA's Ames Research Center. CMEX provides
          information and links on past, current, and future missions to

          orbiting the millisecond pulsar PSR 1257+12 in the constellation
          Virgo. Here, some information on his discovery of three planets
          in the pulsar system is available.

   Hot Jupiters (Why do some giant planets hug their stars?)
          A number of new planets being found orbiting stars have
          surprised astronomers. Most are Jupiter-sized planets in very
          close orbits around their star. Since current solar system
          formation theory holds that Jupiter-sized planets cannot form in
          such proximity to their parental star, the evidence that such
          planets might be commonplace is generating active debate. This
          article discusses some of the current thoughts in the
          astronomical community on such Hot Jupiters.

          The French astronomer Charles Messier put together a list of
          fuzzy objects in the sky which might be mistaken for comets
          (which he was looking for), but do not move across the sky as a
          comet would. His famous catalog includes many of the most easily
          observed planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, galaxies, and
          star clusters. This collection of pictures with captions covers
          all of the 110 objects in the Messier catalog.

          include summaries of the Pluto Express concept, technical
          papers, as well as educational resources and curriculum guides
          for teachers.

  Planetary Alignments

   Much has been made of the May 5, 2000 and other planetary alignments.
          Doomsday advocates claim that earthquakes, asteroids, tectonic
          shifts, or massive solar flares will destroy the Earth. None of
          this is based on fact. Even with a perfect alignment, the net
          planetary tide at Earth is less than one ten-thousanth as strong
          as the Sun's average tidal acceleration on Earth and over 20,000
          times less than the tidal acceleration induced twice every day
          by the Moon.

   The Influence of the Planets
          This site discusses the influence of the planets on the tides of
          the Earth and includes a plot showing the planetary tides from
          1980 to 2008 and clearly shows that May 5, 2000 is nothing
          special.

   Ask An Astronomer
          The Ask-An-Astonomer service has determined the effect of the
          alignment using Newton's Law of Gravitation, answering a
          question that was asked in 1996.
