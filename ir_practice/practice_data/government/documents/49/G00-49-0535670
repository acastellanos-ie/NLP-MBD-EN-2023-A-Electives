      healthfinder® is a free gateway to reliable consumer health and human
      services information developed by the U.S. Department of Health and
      Human Services. When you visit our Web site, we do not collect any
      information about you unless you choose to provide that information to
      us (other than information automatically collected and stored in the
      Web server's logssee below). As a gateway Web site, healthfinder® links
      to other Web sites, and once a user leaves the healthfinder® site to
      visit a linked site, the privacy policy of that site applies.

   personal information

      You do not have to provide any personal information to visit this Web
      site.

      If you choose to provide us with information about yourself through an
      e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain the
      information as long as needed to respond to your question or to fulfill
      the stated purpose of the communication.

      If you choose to use our optional personalization feature, a "cookie"
      containing numerical values will be written to your computer by our Web
      server.  The cookie will not contain any personally identifiable
      information (IP address, e-mail address, or user name).  No information
      will be stored on our server.

   information automatically collected and stored in Web server logs

      When you browse through any Web site, certain personal information
      about you can be collected. Our Web server software automatically
      collects and temporarily stores the following information about each
      visit for statistical purposes:
        * the name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example,
          aol.com, if you are using an America Online account, or
          stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's
          domain)
        * the date and time of the visit
        * the pages visited
        * the address of the Web site you came from when you came to visit

      We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make
      our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated
      otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you.

   disclosure

      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, of which the
      healthfinder® Web site is a part, does not disclose, give, sell, or
      transfer any personal information about visitors, unless required for
      law enforcement or by statute.

   intrusion detection

      This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by
      various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are
      subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.

      For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
      available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic
      to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
      otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement
      investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information
      from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.

      Information originally collected in traditional paper systems can be
      submitted electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions and
      information updates about eligibility benefits. Electronically
      submitted information is maintained and destroyed pursuant to the
      Federal Records Act, and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy
      Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act
      system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided.

      by the Science Panel on Interactive Communication and Health.
