                           Nuclear Energy Research

   Advanced Nuclear Technology

   The Department of Energy has a mission to assure that the nation has a
   flexible and diverse portfolio of secure energy options. Argonne is
   doing Advanced Nuclear Technology Research and Development to assure
   and enhance the continued safe, reliable, and economic operation of
   nuclear power plants. The Advanced Nuclear Technology Area is comprised
   of:
     * Safety Technology
     * Reactor Operations Technology
     * Reactor Materials Research

                 International Nuclear Safety Center (INSC)

   [insctanj.jpg] In addition, Argonne is host to the United States
   International Nuclear Safety Center (INSC), which is collaborating with
   its Russian counterpart on Research and Development programs to enhance
   the safety of Soviet designed nuclear power plants.

   History
     * Sept. 19, 1994 - Vienna - "The United States will establish an
       international nuclear safety center at one of the Department of
       Energy's laboratories." - Secretary of Energy's speech at IAEA on
       September 19, 1994
     * Sept. 1995 - Vienna - The U. S. Secretary of Energy and the Russian
       Minister of Atomic Energy signed a joint statement of intent to
       establish International Centers for Nuclear Safety in the Russian
       Federation and the United States of America.
     * Jan. 1996 - Washington - Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission Meeting - The
       U. S. Secretary of Energy and the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy
       signed a joint statement on the Establishment of International
       Nuclear Safety Centers.

   Goals for the Centers
     * Maintain a base for basic knowledge needed to design nuclear
       reactors;
     * Cooperate in the development of technologies associated with
       nuclear safety in nuclear power engineering;
     * Be international centers for the collection of information
       important for safety and technical improvements in nuclear power
       engineering.

   Organizational Information
     * The US Center is located at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL); it
       was established in October 1995; the Director of the US Center is
       Dr. David Hill.
     * The Russian Federation (RF) Center is located at the Research and
       Development Institute of Power Engineering (RDIPE), in Moscow; it
       was established in August 1996; the Director of the RF Center is
       Prof. Sergei Bougaenko.

   International Nuclear Safety Database
     * A significant product of the nuclear energy research that has been
       done at Argonne is the International Nuclear Safety Database that
       has been established at Argonne.

   Collaborative Research
     * Working together, the two centers have identified a number of
       nuclear safety issues that can be addressed as joint activities and
       collaborative research projects have been initiated. The thrust of
       these projects is to use the resources and the talents of the
       scientists associated with the US Center and the Russian Center to
       do collaborative research that will produce benefits for both the
       US and Russia.
