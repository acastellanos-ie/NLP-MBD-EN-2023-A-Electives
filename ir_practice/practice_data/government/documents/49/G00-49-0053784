                            Civil War Collection

                               Sorted by State

   The Coast & Geodetic Survey's Civil War Collection contains maps and
   charts primarily created by U.S. Coast Survey cartographers for the
   Union Army during the Civil War. Cartographers from the Coast Survey
   were detailed to the Army for reconnaissance and pre-battle mapping and
   for post-battle mapping of unit positions. The Collection contains over
   350 maps and charts from that era.

   The full Collection is sorted by State. File sizes for both the viewing
   (or browser) GIF file and the downloadable TIF file have been included
   in the catalogs. Since most of the map images are in color, the sizes
   of the both types of files can be substantial and can take considerable
   time to either view or download.
