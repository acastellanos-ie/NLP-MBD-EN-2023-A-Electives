   UST Reinsurance Program

   PLIA was established to provide pollution liability insurance that is
   available and affordable, thereby allowing owners and operators to
   comply with the financial responsibility regulations of the Federal
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Washington State
   Department of Ecology (Ecology).

   [shell.jpg] PLIA has entered into contracts with three private insurers
   to market pollution liability insurance to the owners and operators of
   the UST's located in Washington State. PLIA acts as the reinsurer for
   those private insurance companies.

   Reinsurance, in the case of the pollution liability insurance program,
   means that PLIA shares a portion of the cost of settling claims with
   the contracted insurance companies. In the event of a claim, the
   insurance company would determine if the claim was valid under the
   terms of the policy. If valid, they would work with the owner or
   operator to determine a plan for corrective action. An assessment would
   be made to determine the cleanup required on the property where the
   tank is located, if any third-party damage needs to be corrected, and
   if any bodily injury was caused by the incident.
