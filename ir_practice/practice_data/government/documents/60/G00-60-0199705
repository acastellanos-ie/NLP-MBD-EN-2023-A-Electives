Understanding Project Costs and Charges

Charges only cover costs

     * We charge customers only for the cost of the work we perform, i.e.,
       no profit or fee.
     * All customers are charged in the same manner, using generally
       accepted federal accounting practices and a sophisticated project
       accounting system.

   Direct and Indirect Costs
   About 88% of Volpe expenditures are directly tied to specific projects
   and 12% meet essential needs not easily attributed to individual
   projects.

   Labor Costs and Charges
     * The core resource Volpe brings to every project is our federal
       staff. A project's labor charges are the sum of all costs -- direct
       and indirect -- for each hour of work on the project by individual
       Volpe employees.
     * Our labor cost per hour charged, as in any business, is determined
       by:

   employee's compensation
          salary, leave benefits (national holidays, vacation and sick
          leave) and other benefits (retirement, insurance, etc.); and

   indirect costs
          heat, light, administrative services (excluding project
          acquisition), management, and non-project-specific training and
          travel.

   Combining employees' compensation and indirect cost gives the fully
   loaded hourly labor cost as shown.

Costs are Reasonable

     * Labor - With both reasonable compensation and indirect costs, with
       no fee or profit, the Volpe Center labor costs are usually far less
       than charged for comparable talent elsewhere. ^1
          + Compensation: Our federal staff receives standard federal
            salaries, retirement, insurance, and leave. This compensation
            package is below that of federally-funded research and
            development centers ^2 and the private sector for similar
            talent.
          + Indirect: In a study of R&D organizations ^3, our indirect
            cost rates were the lowest.
     * Travel - Volpe benefits from the mass purchasing power of the
       federal government, and enjoys negotiated air travel and hotel
       rates that are 20% to 70% below normal rates.
     * Project Acquisitions - We are skilled at competitively selecting
       and employing cost effective contractor support. More than 90% of
       our acquisitions are competitively awarded.
     * Acquisition Overhead - Our cost to let and administer project
       contracts is no more than 3.9% of the contracts' cost.

Best Value Most Important ^*

     * While our costs are relatively low, our reputation is built on
       providing the best value to our customers.
     * Our experience in performing technical work and in buying expertise
       shows that good quality, rather than least cost, is most important
       for success in complex problem-solving and system implementation.
       Best value is realized when project benefits far exceed costs.

Questions and Answers

   When do customers pay for Volpe support?
   Customers must advance spending authority and cash or equivalent before
   work begins. Both spending authority and cash or equivalent may be
   advanced incrementally (see Volpe's "How to Start Work" brochure).

   How does Volpe ensure its indirect and acquisition pool rate never goes
   up during the fiscal year?
   We start each year with advertised indirect rates slightly higher than
   would be needed if our direct work actually meets expectations. During
   the fiscal year we keep indirect expenditures below the actual
   revenues. At the year end we return any excess revenues to each project
   on a pro-rated basis by lowering the indirect and acquisition pool
   rates.

   Does Volpe have alternative ways of charging projects to recover its
   indirect costs?
   Yes. But only one may be used in any given fiscal year. Over the last
   thirty years the Center has changed methods only twice. In FY'93 we
   changed to recognize that the Center's workload was becoming more
   contractor intensive. And in FY'97 we changed because our work-mix
   became more balanced between federal labor and contractor support.

   Is training charged to a specific project or to indirect?
   In general, employees' time, travel, and tuition for training are
   charged to Volpe's indirect training account. Project-focused training
   is charged directly to projects.

   Does Volpe have any preferential pricing practices?
   No. All customers are charged in the same manner. We have no
   "discounts" or other special pricing arrangements.

   Are funds tied to specific projects?
   Yes. A project's funds may only be used for that project to ensure
   compliance with appropriation law and the intent of Congress.

   Does Volpe guarantee its cost estimates?
   No. Initial project cost estimates are typically revised after work is
   initiated and defined in more detail. Work is performed on a best
   effort (not fixed price) basis. Since Volpe has no funds of its own, if
   funds run out we are required to stop work.

   What happens to unexpended funds on completed projects?
   Funds are returned to you, the customer. Projects are reviewed annually
   to assure funds on completed projects are returned.

   Can customers terminate projects and have funds returned to them?
   Yes. Volpe will return all unexpended funds (after project close-out
   costs have been covered).

   How can customers be confident Volpe is charging them appropriately?
   In addition to regularly sending our customers financial status
   reports, Volpe is audited regularly by DOT's Office of the Inspector
   General.
