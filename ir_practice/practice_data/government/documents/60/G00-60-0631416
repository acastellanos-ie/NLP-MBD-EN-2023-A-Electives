  Introduction

   Non-LTE atomic modeling is crucial for understanding scaled laboratory
   experiments for Stockpile Stewardship.  Above ground experiments (AGEX)
   require detailed atomic physics data.   One way that these atomic data
   are benchmarked is in their application to tokamak plasma
   spectroscopy.  The tokamak plasma is a long lived, well characterized
   and well diagnosed source containing high-Z ions.  Tokamaks field a
   large compliment of diagnostics; independent (non-spectroscopic)
   measurements of the plasma electron temperature and density can be
   made.  Bolometric and high resolution spectroscopy measurements
   directly reflect ionization balance and excitation processes.   The
   x-ray and XUV observations of emission from highly charged high-Z ions
   made in tokamaks compliment experiments with laser-produced high-Z
   plasmas, holraum and gasbag experiments on the Nova laser and the
   development of spectroscopic diagnostics in ICF fuel capsules.

  This cartoon shows many of the non-LTE physics issues of interest to AGEX
              that are tested directly in our tokamak campaigns

   Tokamak plasma spectroscopy research in V-Division is led by Dr. Kevin
   B. Fournier.   The principal tokamak plasma spectroscopy activities
   carried out in V-Division are studies of ionization and recombination
   rate coefficients, and impurity radiative cooling.  These activities
   validate atomic data and collisional-radiative models for emission from
   highly charged ions of high-Z elements.  We also have an extensive
   program of high resolution x-ray and XUV spectroscopy of highly charged
   ions.  This program is used to validate contributions to detailed
   atomic structure calculations from such terms in the Hamiltonian as
   vacuum polarization, Lamb shifts and Breit interactions.  We also
   support ongoing investigations of anomalous impurity transport at other
   research facilities.  These activities apply our spectroscopic models
   to a phenomenological understanding of the relationship between
   electrostatic turbulence in the background plasma and impurity ion
   transport.  Finally, other activities include XUV and VUV studies of
   astrophysically abundant elements (Ne, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Ti, Fe and Ni)
   and the benchmarking of basic atomic data needed for models of highly
   charged high-Z ions.  Measurements of radiative power loss and
   spectroscopy test non-LTE models and contribute to the design of future
   magnetic fusion energy (MFE) facilities.

  Calculation of Ionization and Recombination Rate Coefficients

   One of the basic goals of our tokamak spectroscopy program is the
   benchmarking of ionization and recombination rate coefficients for the
   many charge states of mid- and high-Z impurity ions in the plasma.
   V-Division has for years held leadership in the field of calculating
   the rates of multistep processes such as dielectronic recombination
   (DR) and excitation autoionization (EA).  The techniques that we employ
   will be discussed below.  First, however, some of the basic details
   about our calculations are presented.

   The presence of impurities in a magnetically confined fusion plasma is
   unavoidable; vacuum vessel facing components and limiters contribute to
   the total concentration of high-Z (Z > 20) impurities.  We have
   observed significant differences between measured radial molybdenum ion
   distributions in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak (Plasma Fusion Center,
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology) [1] and in the Frascati Tokamak
   Upgrade (ENEA research center, Frascati, Rome, Italy) [2] and
   predictions made with a plasma modeling code that relies on an average
   atom model [3] for atomic data such as ionization and recombination
   rate coefficients.  The reason for the observed discrepancies is the
   poor quality of the recombination data used as well as the neglect of
   the indirect ionization process, excitation autoionization in the
   plasma modeling code.  Using the HULLAC package [4] of fully
   relativistic atomic structure codes we have computed the level to level
   rates of ionization and recombination for nearly all the ions of argon
   (Z=18) [5], krypton (Z=36) [6] and molybdenum (Z=42) [7].  The cartoon
   below shows some of the ionization and recombination processes that we
   investigate;  autoionization and its inverse, radiationless capture
   (leading to recombination) are the channels coupling adjacent charge
   states that receive our principal efforts.

The processes of dielectronic recombination and excitation autoionization are
    the primary focus of our rate coefficients computations [augtype.gif]

   In the high temperature conditions that exist in the bulk plasma of a
   tokamak, DR is the dominant recombination mechanism.  The rate
   coefficient for DR is given by

                               [Image5.gif] ,

   where V[ij](T[e])  represents the rate of radiationless capture of a
   free electron by level i of ion (q+1)+ to a level j of ion q+ in the
   continuum, the energy of the capture going into the promotion of a
   bound electron, and B^R[j] is the branching ratio for radiative
   stabilization of level j (discussed below).  The rate of electron
   capture is given by

                                [Image6.gif]

   where g[i] represents the statistical weight of level i, A^A[ji] is the
   autoionization rate from level j of ion q+ to level i of ion (q+1)+, R
   is the Rydberg unit of energy, a[0] is the Bohr radius, and DE[ji] is
   the energy difference between the initial level of ion (q+1)+ and the
   doubly excited energy level of ion q+ (a.k.a. the capture energy).  The
   branching ratio for radiative stabilization from a doubly excited level
   j of ion q+ has the form

                                [Image7.gif]

   where G^rad and  G^A represent sums over all levels reachable from j by
   radiative and autoionizing transitions, respectively,

                                [Image8.gif]

                                     and

                                [Image9.gif]

   where A^R[jf] is the radiative transition rate from level j to a level
   f of ion q+, A^R[jj'] is the radiative transition rate from level j to
   some other level j' which also lies in the continuum, and G^stab[j]
   represents a sum of radiative transition rates from level j of ion q+
   to all levels f' below the continuum

                               [Image10.gif] .

   The second term in the parenthesis of the branching ratio represents
   the contribution to recombination from subsequent stabilization
   following radiative transitions between energy levels in the continuum
   (cascades).  This contribution is generally found to be quite small.


   For certain iso-electronic sequences, particularly those near to
   iso-electronic sequences with filled shell ground configurations (He-,
   Ne-, Ni-like ions), EA is the dominant ionization mechanism.  The cross
   section for EA from a level i of ion q+ to all possible levels of ion
   (q+1)+ is given by

                                [Image12.gif]

   where s^ex(i->j) is the electron impact excitation cross section from
   level i to level j (an energy level in the continuum of ion q+) and
   B^A[j] is the branching ratio for autoionization from level j to all
   possible levels of the next ion.  In the present work, B^A[j] has the
   form

                                [Image16.gif]

   where G^rad and  G^A and A^R[jj'] are as above.  The second term in the
   parenthesis in the branching ratio represents the contribution to the
   total EA rate from autoionization following radiative transitions
   between energy levels in the continuum.  This contribution is found to
   be small to negligible for all ions studied here.  The rate coefficient
   for the EA process from a specific level i is

                                [Image17.gif]

   where Q[ij]^ex is the impact excitation rate coefficient from level i
   to level j, found by averaging the electron impact excitation cross
   section over a Maxwellian distribution of free electron velocities

                                [Image18.gif]

   where v is the electron velocity and f(v) is the electron velocity
   distribution.  The figure below shows the contribution that
   excitation-autoionization makes to the total ionization rate from the
   ground level of certain ions.  The plotted quantity is the ratio of the
   sum of direct electron impact ionization (DI) plus EA over the rate of
   DI alone.

          in certain M-shell charge states of argon and molybdenum

  Calculation of the Charge State Distribution

   At a given temperature, the rates of EA and DR, along with the rates
   for direct electron impact ionization (including contributions from
   ionization from both the valence and inner subshells) and radiative
   radiative recombination are used to compute the charge state
   distribution (CSD) for a given element.  In the low density limit that
   obtains in tokamak plasmas, the ratio of the densities of two adjacent
   charge states is given by

                                [Image19.gif]

   where S^q(T[e]) and a^q+1(T[e]) are the total rates for ionization and
   recombination from the ground levels of ions q+ and (q+1)+,
   respectively.  The quantity f[q]^CE(T[e]), the relative fraction of a
   charge state in the plasma is given in coronal equilibrium by

                                [Image20.gif]

   where n[Z]^q is the number density of ion q+, and n[Z] is the number
   density of all ions of atom Z.  The equation for the relative densities
   of two charge states, along with the condition

                                [Image22.gif]

   provides a complete set of equations for the ions of impurity Z.  The
   CSDs for Ar, Kr and Mo are compared below to calculations that neglect
   EA in the total rate of ionization.  For Ar, one sees a modest
   perturbation to the Na- to S-like charge states.  The L- and K-shell
   ions are unaffected.

                                  [008.gif]

   In the case of Kr, the same near Ne-like charge states are strongly
   perturbed by the presence of EA in the CSD calculation.  The
   enhancement of the total ionization rate for the near filled shell ions
   means they are "burned through" much more quickly than they would be in
   a calculation without EA.  The filled shell Ne-like ion, due to the
   large step in ionization energies going from the M- to the L-shell does
   not have strong EA channels; the greater stability of the Ne-like ion
   relative to the adjacent M-shell ions means its abundance is greatly
   enhanced.

                                  [009.gif]



   The same phenomenon is observed near Ne-like Mo, and also near the
   filled shell Ni-like Mo ion.  That is, the large step in ionization
   energies going from the N- to the M-shell means that the Cu-, Zn-, Ga-
   and Ge-like ions are "burned through" much more quickly than is the
   filled shell Ni-like ion.

                                  [010.gif]




  Measured Impurity Ion Emission Profiles

   Now that we have predicted the CSD, we'd like to test the
   calculations.  This is carried out by observing the equilibrium
   distribution of ions in a tokamak plasma.  For this, we have an array
   of photometrically calibrated, time resolving, spatially scannable
   spectrometers at the various tokamak facilities with which we
   collaborate.   Using these x-ray and X/VUV spectrometers, along with
   independent diagnostics of temperature (Thomson scattering, electron
   cyclotron emission) and electron density (near IR interferometry,
   microwave reflectometery) the brightness of different transitions can
   be measured along several lines of sight, each of which samples a
   different peak temperature.  These data can then be Abel inverted to
   yield the emissivity profile for the given transition as a function of
   radius in the plasma (which is equivalent to temperature).   Shown
   below is a photo of one of our spectrometers mounted on the Frascati
   Tokamak Upgrade.  In every case, the spectrometers have been
   photometrically calibrated, and thus an absolute signal can be
   measured.  This allows us to determine the absolute concentration of an
   impurity in the plasma.

   An example of our data as measured at the Alcator C-Mod tokamak at MIT
   is shown below.  In this figure, strong resonance lines from Na- and
   Mg-like molybdenum, Mo^31+ and Mo^30+, along with a weaker line from
   Al-like Mo^29+ and lines from intrinsic impurities (C, O and F) are
   seen.  One notices immediately that the molybdenum features dominate.
   As the line of sight changes from frame (a) to frame (c), the absolute
   signal level drops because the peak plasma temperature along the line
   of sight is dropping.  Frame (b) shows a simulated molybdenum spectrum
   for the central line of sight.  The agreement with the absolute signal
   is excellent.

   Shown below is another example of the kind of data we acquire.  For
   this spectrum, Kr gas was introduced through a pizo-electric valve to
   the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade plasma [8].  This M-shell Kr spectrum has
   more lines in it than do the molybdenum spectra above.  This is because
   there are more emitting charge states (KrXVIII to KrXXIII) most of
   which have a more complicated ground configuration than the (simple)
   Na- and Mg-like charge states above.  The strong line at 93.35 Å is due
   to Ar-like Kr^18+, which has a simple ground configuration (3p^6) but
   which has many more excitation channel than do the Na- or Mg-like ions.

   To interpret the observed emission from a single ion, a
   collisional-radiative (CR) model is constructed that provides
   information on the net excitation rate for a given line.  In the case
   of emission from a single charge state, the CR level populations are
   found by solving the set of rate equations

                                [Image24.gif]

   where n[j] is the relative population of level j, Q[ji] is the
   collisional rate coefficient from level j to level i for excitation (e)
   or de-excitation (d), A[ji] is the radiative transition probability
   from level j to level i and M is the number of levels used in the
   model.  All electric and magnetic dipole and quadrupole radiative
   transitions (E1, M1, E2 and M2) as computed by HULLAC [4] are taken
   into account.  The CR model includes relativistic calculations of fine
   structure energy levels, radiative decay and (semi-relativistic) Auger
   decay rates.  For the densities that obtain in tokamak plasmas,
   forbidden radiative channels (M1, E2 and M2) can give lines that are
   quite bright in an ion's spectrum.  Direct electron impact excitation
   rate coefficients are computed (semi-relativistically) in the distorted
   wave approximation.  The contribution to a level's population from
   ionization and recombination from adjacent charge states can also be
   included.  In that case the ionization and recombination channels enter
   the set of rate equations as additional source and sink terms.   The
   cartoon below shows the CR processes coupling the He- and Li-like
   aluminum atoms.  The forward ionization processes (autoionization and
   direct impact ionization) are computed using HULLAC; data for the
   inverse processes (dielectronic attachment and three-body
   recombination) are computed by enforcing the principle of detailed
   balance.  The more general form of the CR rate equations is shown in
   the insert in the figure.

   The CR model (neglecting ionization and recombination) is adequate for
   interpreting the emission from a single charge state.  However, to
   interpret the spectrum from a hot plasma where many charge states are
   present requires the weighting of the emission from each charge state
   by the relative ion abundances.  If the plasma were truly iso-thermal,
   this would be a direct test of the computed CSD's.  However, the
   emission that is observed from the tokamak plasma is integrated along
   the line of sight of the spectrometer and may sample a large range of
   temperature and density conditions.

   Since our spectrometers are spatially scannable, the brightness of
   different transitions can be measured along several lines of sight,
   each of which samples a different peak temperature.  These data can
   then be Abel inverted to yield the emissivity profile for the given
   transition as a function of radius in the plasma (which is equivalent
   to temperature).  The measured data are shown below, along with two
   simulations for the line of sight integrated brightness of each
   transition.  The two simulations have the same CR excitation model
   embedded in a plasma transport model and the different charge state
   distributions that are contrasted above.   The first figure shows XUV
   emission profiles from six transitions in four L-shell argon ions as
   measured at the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade (left) and the x-ray emission
   profile from the  He[a] line  in Ar^16+ (right).  The brightness
   profile computed using the HULLAC CSD is shown in green, the profile
   computed without EA and approximate DR rate coefficients is shown in
   red.  As already stated above, the effect of EA on the argon CSD is
   small, and the L- and K-shell ions are generally unperturbed.  This is
   seen to be the case in the simulations below; both simulations
   reproduce the XUV and x-ray data well.

                                  [011.gif]


   In the case of Kr, brightness profiles for XUV transitions in five ions
   are shown below.  These are all M-shell Dn=0 (3-3) transitions.   The
   simulations for the Na- and Mg-like ions show the greatest difference
   due to the presence of EA in the HULLAC CSD calculation.  The measured
   data support the simulation that includes EA.  For the other charge
   states, Cl-, Ar- and K-like, the simulations show smaller differences,
   however, the data still support the HULLAC calculations.

                                  [012.gif]

   The figure below shows five x-ray emission profiles for three Mo ions,
   the Na-, Ne- and F-like charge states.  (The XUV spectra of the Na- and
   Mg-like ions have been shown above.)  In the figure below, in the panel
   on the left is the spectrum of three of the x-ray lines [9] as measured
   along a central line of sight with a Von Hammos type crystal
   spectrograph.  The lines are from 2p<-4d transitions in the three
   charge states.  Below the data is the simulated spectrum with the
   HULLAC CR model and the HULLAC CSD (middle) and the simulation with the
   HULLAC CR model and the old CSD (bottom).  The agreement for the HULLAC
   CSD simulation is very good.  The radiative brightness profiles for all
   five 2p<-4d transitions are shown in the panel on the right.  The
   simulations agree well with the data for the central (higher
   temperature) observations, but less well for the outer parts of the
   profile.  This may be due to less signal (due to colder plasma
   temperatures) and effects due to anomalous transport that are not
   included in our model.

  Calculations of Radiative Cooling Coefficients

   Copious impurity radiation from the core of an tokamak plasma will be
   deleterious to energy and particle confinement, and can quench the
   fusion reaction.  On the other hand, exhausting an adequate fraction of
   an ignited plasma's power over the surface area of the vessel's entire
   first wall, rather than onto a small area of the divertor strike plates
   is crucial to the successful, sustained operation of the divertor in a
   fusion reactor.  Impurity ion radiative processes are the most likely
   mechanism for achieving this operating condition; robust, quantitative
   predictions of impurity radiative loss rates are therefore essential.
   Recent work has suggested that the controlled introduction of a
   recycling impurity such as krypton (Z = 36) may be the best solution
   for enhancing radiative power losses [10] in the outer part (mantle) of
   a fusion plasma.

   Power losses via collisionally fed line radiation, dielectronic
   recombination line emission and radiative recombination and
   bremsstrahlung continuum emission have been evaluated.  The power loss
   coefficient for line radiation from an ion (with charge q+) at a fixed
   temperature is given by

                                [Image25.gif]

   where J[jf](T[e]) (in units of photon cm^3 sec^-1) is found from the
   collisional-radiative model and the sum is taken over all possible
   radiative transitions.  Because J[jf](T[e]) comes from the CR model,
   emission due to "forbidden" transitions (non-electric dipole
   transitions) and emission fed by excitation from levels other than the
   ground level (metastable levels and other excited levels) are included
   in the sum.  The amount of power radiated per unit volume by
   collisional-radiative line emission from an impurity atom (with atomic
   number Z) in a fusion plasma is given by

                                [Image26.gif]

   where n[q] is the number density of an impurity ion of charge q+ and
   the sum is taken over all charge states of the atom.  The sum in the
   equation above can be expressed as

                                [Image27.gif]

   where n[Z] is the total number density of atom Z and f[q]^CE(T[e]) is
   given by calculated charge state distribution.   The radiative cooling
   coefficient has the units of ergs s^-1 cm^-3 (impurity density)^-1.
   For the range of densities encountered in our tokamak experiments, the
   radiative cooling coefficient is found to scale linearly with density.
   Thus, by dividing the cooling coefficient by the electron density used
   in the CR model, the resulting units are ergs s^-1 cm^-3 (impurity
   density)^-1 (electron density)^-1.  The power loss coefficient for
   nearly all molybdenum ions as computed at six different temperatures is
   shown (for an electron density of 5.0x10^13 cm^-3) in the left panel of
   the  figure below, the power loss coefficient computed at six different
   electron densities is shown (for a temperature equal to each ion's
   ionization potential) in the right panel of the figure below [11].  The
   fact that all six traces scale linearly with increasing electron
   density in the right panel means that the power loss coefficient is
   independent of density in this range.  For much lower densities (N[e] ~
   10^8 cm^-3) , the contribution to the power loss by lines excited from
   metastable levels falls off quickly.  For higher densities (N[e] ~
   10^16 cm^-3), forbidden radiative transitions are quenched by electron
   collisions.

                           [P01225-kbf-u-001.gif]

   Impurity ions in a tokamak plasma can also radiate through channels
   other than electron impact excitation of line emission; we also compute
   the rate of power loss through line emission fed by dielectronic
   recombination and continuum emission via radiative recombination and
   bremsstrahlung.  The resulting cooling coefficient for all radiative
   channels, and the sum over all channels, the total cooling coefficient
   is shown below for Ar, Kr and Mo.  It is clear from the plots that the
   CR line emission dominates the total cooling rate.  Also shown in each
   plot is the ADPAK cooling coefficient [12] for each element.  In the
   case of Ar, the ADPAK cooling coefficient has been updated by
   researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory [13] using CR models
   similar to those used here.  The Ar cooling coefficient computed here
   [14] and that given by the updated ADPAK agree very well for
   temperatures between 200 and 2000 eV.  For lower temperatures the
   calculations show differences of factors of a few.  In the case of Kr
   [15] and Mo [11], the two calculations diverge strongly at low
   temperatures, with the differences reaching orders of magnitude.
   Overall, at higher temperatures, there is general agreement to within a
   factor of two.

  Bolometric Measurements of Impurity Radiative Cooling

   The contribution of each ion to the total radiative cooling rate for an
   impurity in a tokamak plasma is benchmarked against spectroscopic
   observations as described above.  The total cooling coefficient is
   tested by simulating bolometric profiles measured at FT-U and C-Mod.
   The data are collected with a bolometer array with up to 13 viewing
   chords through the plasma.  These multiple channels allow us to perform
   Abel inversion on the measured signals and get the volumetric radiative
   emissivity for the plasma.  (A small correction is made for the
   contribution of neutral particles to the bolometer's signal.)   Below
   is a cartoon of the bolometric arrays used for the present work.

                                  [019.gif]

   In the case where there has been a controlled introduction of the
   impurity species, or in the case where the plasma impurity content is
   dominated by a single species, we measure directly that impurity's
   radiative losses.  The inverted bolometric profile as measured in the
   Frascati Tokamak Upgrade is shown below.  The large bump in the
   experimental data at the outermost radii (coldest temperatures) is due
   to radiative losses from intrinsic oxygen; aside from oxygen,
   molybdenum is the overwhelmingly dominant impurity species in the
   plasma.  Also shown are simulations made using the cooling coefficient
   computed here (HULLAC) and using the ADPAK cooling coefficient.  The
   two experimental traces (labeled m=4 and m=6) are the inverted signals
   from the bolometer array.  The two numbers, m=4 and m=6, are the orders
   of the polynomial to which the data is fit before Abel inversion is
   carried out.  The difference between the two fits is an indication of
   the uncertainty in the experimental data.  The measured data confirm
   the HULLAC cooling coefficient for temperatures between 300 and 2000
   eV.

                                  [015.gif]



   Shown below are preliminary simulations of the bolometer measurements
   made during a Kr and Ar injections at FTU.  The inverted bolometer data
   is given by the squares, and has (at best) a 2 cm spatial resolution.
   The simulation made with the cooling curves shown above are given by
   the dash-dot traces (labeled HULLAC, new CSD).  In both the case of Ar
   and Kr, these simulation give the best agreement with the data.  In the
   case of Kr (the figure immediately below) the ADPAK simulation from
   Ref. [12] is shown along with a simulation using the HULLAC
   collisional-radiative line emission models and the old CSD without EA.
   In both cases, the data for higher temperatures do not favor these
   simulations.  The bolometer measurements do not have the necessary
   spatial resolution to map out features such as the notch near 18 cm in
   the case of Kr and 21 cm in the case of Ar.

  Resonance Enhancement of DWA Impact Excitation Rate Coefficients

   At energies below the threshold for direct electron impact excitation,
   resonant excitations can make a significant contribution to the total
   excitation rate of a given energy level.  The resonant excitation
   process is nearly the same as the dielectronic recombination process
   described above, however, in this case, instead of multiplying the rate
   of capture of a free electron by the branching ratio for radiative
   stabilization, the rate is now multiplied by the branching ratio for
   autoionization back to excited levels of the initial ion [16] .   The
   distorted wave approximation collisional excitation rate coefficients
   computed by HULLAC [4] do not account for this multistep excitation
   mechanism; for nearly all highly charged, high-Z ions, neglecting
   resonant enhancement of direct electron impact excitation is a good
   approximation.  However, for certain electric quadrupole transitions in
   Ni-like Mo^14+, the large manifold of autoionizing resonances in
   Cu-like Mo^13+ enables an enhancement of the direct impact excitation
   rates that is not negligible.  This process is laid out in a cartoon in
   the panel on the right of the figure below.

   The use of non-electric dipole ("forbidden") transitions as diagnostics
   of plasma density has been a standard technique in spectroscopy for
   many years.  The slow rate of the forbidden decays relative to E1 decay
   rates means that as the density of the plasma increases, the forbidden
   decays are quenched due to collisional destruction of their upper
   levels much earlier than are E1 decays.  The ratio of the forbidden to
   E1 decays is thus an indication of the local plasma density.  In the
   case of Ni-like Mo^14+, for the low densities that obtain in tokamaks,
   the 3d - 4s electric quadrupole (E2) transitions can be brighter than
   the nearby 3d - 4p E1 decays.  This is the case in the figure below
   (left panel).  This spectrum was measured by Sugar, Reader and Rowan in
   the TEXT tokamak [17]; also seen in the spectrum are several 3d - 4s E2
   lines from Co-like Mo^15+.   The reason the the E2 lines are bright,
   despite their relatively slow decay rates, is that the levels from
   which the transitions proceed are highly populated.  In order to
   calculate the level populations, it is necessary to include the
   enhancement due to resonance excitation that is shown in the panel on
   the right.

                                  [018.gif]



   The factor by which the resonance contribution enhances the direct
   excitation rate coefficient is shown in the the figure below.  This
   figure is similar to what is shown above for the case of excitation
   autoionization enhancement of direct ionization.  That is, the figure
   shows the ratio of the resonant plus direct excitation rate coefficient
   over the direct excitation rate coefficient alone.  The ratios shown
   here are for the two upper levels giving rise to the 3d - 4s E2
   transitions, and the two upper levels giving rise to the 3d - 4p E1
   transitions.   The levels are indicated by two jj-coupled orbitals, the
   first being the 3d hole from which the excitation took place, and the
   second being the n=4 orbital to which the electron was promoted.  The
   enhancement is seen to be a strong function of temperature, with the
   greatest enhancement coming at the lower temperatures.  Investigations
   in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak [16] have shown that the MoXV ion achieves
   equilibrium in a plasma with an electron temperature near 100 eV, thus
   the contribution of the resonances to the excitation of the E2
   transitions must be taken into account.

                              [rx.enhance.GIF]

   We have injected Mo (Z=42), Nb (Z=41) and Zr (Z=40) into the Alcator
   C-Mod tokamak in order to measure the ratio of the brightness of the
   Ni-like 3d^10 - 3d^94s E2 lines to the 3d^10 - 3d^94p E1 lines at
   different densities.  We have used an absolutely calibrated 2.2 m
   grazing incidence spectrometer with approximately 1 cm spatial
   resolution and a 4 msec integration time for each frame.  The detector
   was a microchannel plate coupled to a 1024 element self-scanning
   Reticon linear array.  A Zr injection is shown below.  The background
   subtracted data is shown in frame (c) and the line of sight for which
   the Zr^13+ emission is maximal is shown in the insert on the right.
   The Ni-like Zr ion exists in a low temperature plasma region near the
   plasma x-point.

                                 [Zr.E2.GIF]

   We have computed the ratio of  the brightness of the two 3d - 4s E2 to
   the two 3d - 4p E1 transitions in MoXV as a function of electron
   temperature and density.  This result is shown in the figure below.
   The sensitivity of the ratio to density is due to the collisional
   quenching of the upper levels of the E2 decays as described above.  The
   sensitivity to temperature is greatly enhanced by the presence of the
   strong resonance enhancement channels at low temperatures.  The figure
   also has two experimental measurements made with photometrically
   calibrated instruments in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak and a calibrated
   measurement by Klapisch et al. in the TFR tokamak [18].  The density in
   the Alcator C-Mod tokamak is much higher than in either the TEXT
   tokamak or TFR.  Still, even so, we could not reach the density where
   strong collisional quenching is observed.  The measured electron
   density (using microwave reflectometry) is used to place the points
   from C-Mod on the curve.  The resulting electron temperatures suggested
   by the data for the two shots are consistent with the measured bulk
   plasma temperature profile and the divertor temperature profile.  The
   spatial location of the emitting lines is known only to within ~ 1 cm.

  L-shell x-rays in Zr, Nb, Mo and Pd


   We have conducted a large campaign of impurity injection experiments at
   the Alcator C-Mod tokamak with the aim of observing the level structure
   of the Ne-like (and adjacent) charge states of Kr (Z=36), Zr (Z=40), Nb
   (Z=41), Mo (Z=42) and Pd (Z=46) [19].   The observations are made with
   an array of five spatially scannable, high resolution Von Hammos type
   spectrometers.  The radial profiles of x-ray transitions in argon and
   molybdenum recorded with this instrument are shown above.   The very
   high spectral resolution of this instrument (l/Dl ~ 4000) allows us to
   test higher order terms in our basic atomic structure calculations,
   such as the contributions of vacuum polarization, the Lamb shift and
   the Breit interaction to a level's total energy.  Shown in the frame
   below is a spectrum from a zirconium injection in the range of the
   Ne-like Zr^30+ 2p^6 - 2p^5(3/2)7d(5/2) J=1 and 2p^6 - 2p^5(1/2)6d(3/2)
   J=1 transitions.  Also shown, but not labeled are transitions from Na-
   and F-like zirconium.  Theoretical calculations of transition energies
   and oscillator strengths are plotted under the data.  The agreement is
   excellent.

                                 [ne.zr.GIF]

   In the frame below, x-ray transitions in four palladium ions are
   shown.  The strongest line is the Ne-like 2p^5(1/2)3d(3/2) J=1
   transition at 3731.7 mÅ.  Also shown are 2p - 3d transitions in Na-,
   Mg- and Al-like Pd.   Again, theoretical calculations for transition
   energies and oscillator strengths are plotted under the data.

                                 [ne.pd.GIF]

   One result from this campaign is a study of the transfer of strength
   from one transition to another as the upper levels of those transitions
   approach each other in energy.  The Ne-like ions of Zr, Nb, Mo and Pd
   are ideal for this task.  In the figure below, the 2p(3/2) - 7d(5/2)
   and 2p(1/2) - 6d(3/2) neonlike transitions in Mo, Nb and Zr are shown;
   as Z increases, the emission features are seen to be moving closer
   together.  (In every case, there is a small sodiumlike feature that is
   close to the 2p(1/2) - 6d(3/2) neonlike line.)  As the 2p(1/2) -
   6d(3/2) upper level moves closer to the upper level of the 2p(3/2) -
   7d(5/2) transition, the strength of the 2p(1/2) - 6d(3/2) is seen to
   diminish relative to that of the 2p(3/2) - 7d(5/2) transition [19]; the
   reason for the transfer of strength is due to the configuration
   interaction between the upper levels.

                                [ne.6-7.gif]

   In the figure below, the calculated oscillator strengths are plotted
   for the four 2p(1/2,3/2) - 6d(3/2,5/2) and 2p(1/2,3/2) - 7d(3/2,5/2)
   transitions for all elements from Y (Z=39) to Pd (Z=46).  In the lower
   frame of the figure is plotted the calculated energy difference between
   the 2p(1/2) - 6d(3/2) and 2p(3/2) - 7d(5/2) upper levels; between Mo
   and Tc (Z=43) the order of the levels switches and the 2p5(1/2)6d(3/2)
   level becomes higher in energy than the 2p5(3/2)7d(5/2) level.  As the
   levels approach, the higher energy 2p(3/2) - 7d(5/2) transition
   oscillator strength is seen to be strengthened at the expense of the
   2p(1/2) - 6d(3/2) transition.  After the levels cross, the transfer of
   strength is in the other direction.  The data shown above confirm this
   result.

                               [ne.scale.gif]

  M-shell x-rays in highly charged W ions

   Shown below are two spectra recorded by Dr. Rudolf Neu during tungsten
   (Z=74) injections into ASDEX Upgrade tokamak plasmas [20].  The
   tungsten injections into the ASDEX plasma are made by laser ablation of
   tungsten from a glass slide at a rate of 20 Hz, resulting in a nearly
   constant tungsten inventory during the discharge.  The central
   temperature in the two cases differs by nearly 30%.  The strong
   emission near 7Å is due to transitions of the form 3d - 4p, the higher
   energy features near 5.5Å are due to 3d - 4f transitions [21].  The
   spectra are acquired with a rotating crystal Bragg spectrometer; the
   constancy of the plasma conditions and the tungsten inventory with time
   are important considerations.  The relative strength of the 3d - 4p
   transitions to the 3d - 4f transitions is at odds with
   collisional-radiative predictions.  Understanding the origin of this
   discrepancy is an ongoing part of our research program.  In the upper
   frame, the strongest emission features are from charge states with
   ground configurations iso-electronic to ions in the middle of the 4p^k
   subshell (W^41+, As-like 4p^3, W^40+, Se-like 4p^4).  In the lower
   frame, the emission has shifted to lines from higher charge states,
   including the last of the N-shell ions, Zn- and Cu-like W^44+ and W^45+
   (4s^2 and 4s^1).  In the lower frame, the emission from the M-shell
   Ni-like W^46+ is seen to be strongly enhanced due to the increased
   temperature.

                              [w.spec.5.8.gif]

  XUV observations of N-shell W ions

   The Dn=0 (4-4) counterparts to the Dn=1 (3-4) x-ray lines discussed
   above have been measured with an absolutely calibrated McPherson type
   spectrometer by Dr. Knut Asmussen at the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak [22].
   These Dn=0 spectra have been developed into a sensitive diagnostic of
   the tungsten concentration in the plasma, the details of that
   development are given elsewhere [22].  The tungsten injections into the
   ASDEX plasma are made by laser ablation of tungsten from a glass slide
   at a rate of 20 Hz.  The spectrum in the 120 to 140Å range is shown in
   the figure below.  The digitized data from the multichannel plate is
   shown in the top frame, the time of the first tungsten injection is
   clear in the data.  A background subtracted line-out of the data is
   shown in the middle frame.  The CR calculations done with HULLAC are
   shown in the bottom frame [21].  Nearly all of the transitions in this
   range are 4s - 4p transitions; there is a much larger discrepancy
   between the HULLAC wavelengths and the observed wavelengths for these
   transitions than for the x-ray transitions modeled above.

                               [vuv_spec2.GIF]

   The 4p-4d transitions in the N-shell W ions are shown in the figure
   below.  The transitions near 60Å are nearly coincident with 4d-4f
   transition arrays from lower charge states.  These transition arrays
   make a quasi-continuum whose shape evolves strongly with increasing
   temperature.  By monitoring the time history of the tungsten
   injections, we can see the quasi-continuum burn through and these
   unambiguous emission lines [22] emerge.  The calculated wavelengths in
   this spectral region agree better with the observations than do those
   in the figure above.  Precise observations of radiative transitions in
   highly charged high-Z ions help us to test directly the methods
   employed by our atomic structure codes.

  Direct Measurement of Impurity Fluxes

    Often the ions in a tokamak plasma are seen to be distributed in a way
   that is different than what the coronal equilibrium would predict.
   Tokamak plasma spectroscopy in V-Division supports investigations into
   anomalous transport, the cause of this departure from equilibrium.  One
   way research in V-Division has made an impact in this field is by
   providing highly detailed models for the emissivity of x-ray
   transitions in molybdenum ions near the neonlike charge state [2].
   With these models, researchers at the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade (FTU)
   have been able to use the measured x-ray emission profiles for three
   adjacent molybdenum ions to construct the impurity flux profile across
   the plasma [23].  With this profile, the strength of the transport
   effects on individual ions, at nearly all radii in the plasma, can be
   determined; this is a major step forward in the understanding of the
   phenomena that drive anomalous impurity transport.


   The x-ray profiles measured at  FTU have been recorded with a rotating
   crystal Bragg spectrometer coupled to a multi-wire proportional counter
   detector [24] that were designed and built by researchers at FTU.  The
   spectrometer has mountings for six crystals, which allows for
   sensitivity to different energy regions during the discharge.  The
   detector provides a fast count rate, good energy resolution, and, by
   exploiting differences in sensitivity to different orders of
   diffraction, discrimination of the different orders that appear in the
   spectrum.  A photograph of the spectrometer and the housing for the six
   crystals is shown in the figure below.  A cartoon showing the
   principles by which the spectrometer and detector work is shown below
   the photograph.

   A spectrum covering the full energy range of the RCS at FTU is shown
   below.  The n=2 to n=1 Hea transitions in Ti (Z=22), Cr (Z=24), Mn
   (Z=25), Fe (Z=26) and Ni (Z=28) are visible at the highest energies.
   The n=3 to n=2 transitions from the F-like Mo^33+ to the Mg-like Mo^30+
   ions are seen at the lower energy side of the spectrum.  There is a
   sharp edge in the detector efficiency near 3.8 Å due to an absorption
   edge in argon, the detector fill gas [24].

                               [FTU.8001.gif]

   The two panels below show a blow up of the molybdenum emission between
   4.2 and 5.4 Å (top), and a synthetic spectrum for the line of sight of
   the spectrometer on this discharge, #8001 (bottom).  The dominant
   Ne-like Mo^32+ emission features are labeled in the bottom panel with
   the conventional notation.  The bottom panel shows a very high spectral
   resolution simulation as well as the same simulation degraded to the
   resolution of the spectrometer and detector.  The blending of the weak
   lines from Mo^31+ and Mo^30+ with the strong neonlike transitions
   accounts for nearly all the features seen in the data in the top
   panel.  With an assumed smoothly increasing background level (shown by
   the dashed line in the top panel), the relative integrated areas under
   the experimental and synthetic peaks agree very well [2].



                             [FTU.8001.comp.GIF]

   Given our knowledge of the emission spectra of near neonlike molybdenum
   ions, the brightness of specific lines in Mo^32+, Mo^31+ and Mo^30+
   have been measured by Dr. Danilo Pacella at FTU in a series of
   reproducible discharges [23].  The measured brightnesses for the three
   lines have been Able inverted to yield the emissivity profile for the
   lines as a function of radius in the plasma.  The spectrometer has been
   absolutely calibrated, so the measurement can be converted into an
   absolute emissivity.  The raw data (before inversion) for the
   observations are shown in the three panels below.

                             [ftu.profiles.GIF]

   Given that the absolute emissivity of the transition in each ion is
   measured as a function of radius, and that the electron temperature and
   density profiles are independently measured, the densities of the
   specific ions can then be found.  The collisional-radiaitive model
   developed by Dr. Kevin Fournier in V-Division confirms that the three
   transitions chosen for this experiment are fed overwhelmingly by direct
   excitations from the ground level of the respective charge state.  The
   excitation rates are computed using HULLAC for several temperatures in
   the FTU, and the ion densities are derived.  The results are shown in
   the figure below.  Also shown are the predicted ion density profiles
   for the case of coronal equilibrium.  The experimental profiles extend
   much further out in the plasma and are less sharply peaked than in the
   coronal equilibrium case.

                              [FTU.iondens.GIF]

   Given that we know the absolute density for three adjacent charge
   states, and we know the rates of ionization and recombination between
   the charge states, we can use the equation of continuity

                                [Image28.gif]

   to derive the absolute flux of Mo^31+ across the plasma.  In steady
   state, the explicit time derivative is zero and the divergence of the
   flux can be derived from the knowledge of the source terms,

                                [Image29.gif]

   where S and a represent the total ionization and recombination rates
   for each ion and are functions of the local electron temperature,
   T[e](r), and N[e] is the electron density.  The flux is derived by
   radial integration of the equation above,

                               [Image30.gif] .

   In the present case, the flux G[31+] of Mo^31+ can be derived using the
   density profiles N[32+], N[31+] and N[30+] that have been obtained from
   the soft x-ray spectra.  Thus [23],  [Image31.gif] .
   The result is shown in the figure below.

                             [FTU.mo31flux.GIF]

   The resulting Mo^31+ flux represents the transport effect of the plasma
   on this impurity ion.  We can then define a radial drift velocity
   associated with the flux G[31+],

                               [Image32.gif] .

   This quantity is plotted for Mo^31+ in the figure below, along with the
   electron temperature and density profiles, as measured with electron
   cyclotron emission and DCN interferometery, respectively.  The radial
   drift velocity has the advantage that it does not depend on the
   absolute amount of Mo^31+ present and thus is independent of the
   absolute calibration of the RCS.  The result of the present analysis
   is, as expected, that the transport effect is small in the central
   region and very large in the intermediate region of the plasma.  In
   fact, the transport effect is more than one order of magnitude greater
   than the neoclassical prediction in the intermediate region of the
   plasma (well outside the error bars on the radial drift velocity due to
   the inversion of the ion density profiles).

                                [FTU.v_r.GIF]

   Near the maximum of V[r] in the figure below, the thermal drift
   velocity for Mo^31+ is approximately 5 x 10^6 cm s^-1, so the drift
   velocity is about 0.4% of the thermal one.  Starting from the measured
   V[r], we can estimate the order of magnitude of the impurity
   confinement time along the radius,

                               [Image33.gif] .

   The result is that t[t] is of the order of tens of ms in the central
   region (having taken for V[r] the maximum value given by the error
   bars) and it falls to about 1 ms at r = 15cm, where the transport is
   very large.  As can be seen, the radial outgoing velocity V[r] is
   negligible in the central region and indicates a large anomalous
   transport effect in the region around the plasma's half radius, a
   region where many of the plasma parameters exhibit strong radial
   gradients (see the figure above).

  Transport profiles during auxiliary heating

   Progress in magnetic confinement fusion research has produced plasmas
   with continuously higher temperatures.  Moreover, interest in advanced
   tokamak scenarios is continuously growing, requiring more refined
   diagnostic tools to investigate particle transport processes.  All this
   has stimulated the study of the atomic physics of highly ionized medium
   Z elements, like molybdenum (Z=42).  On one hand, the tokamak plasma
   provides a "laboratory" where atomic calculations, relevant in many
   others fields, can be experimentally validated and, on the other hand,
   these models allow the understanding of many plasma processes.

   Atomic calculations performed at LLNL have been used to understand the
   molybdenum x-ray emission from the FTU plasma in two different
   scenarios with electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), providing
   important information about the plasma impurity content [25].  In the
   first case, with on axis heating and a central electron temperature of
   8 keV [26],  the analysis is performed during the current ramp up when
   the magnetic shear is still negative or zero [27].  In a toroidal
   configuration with nested magnetic surfaces, the magnetic shear s is a
   measure of the radial variation of the safety factor q, i.e. of the
   field lines winding index. The magnetic shear is defined by s = (1/r)
   dq/dr so that shear reversal (i.e. negative shear in the plasma core)
   implies the presence of an off-axis minimum in the q profile.  In the
   second case, with off axis heating and a peak temperature of 7 keV,
   spectra are analyzed when the current reaches the plateau and sawtooth
   activity occurs.  These results will be discussed and compared in the
   following sections.  The radial profiles of the electron temperature
   (Te) are shown for both discharges, as measured by ECE, in the figure
   below.

   Two molybdenum spectra from shot #12658, one during ECRH and one after,
   are compared in the figure below.  Since the wavelengths are scanned in
   approximately 5 ms, a time shorter than the time evolution of the
   density and temperature, the plasma can be assumed stationary on this
   time scale.  It is seen that the three features that we label a, b and
   g, which are dominated by transitions from Mo^35+, Mo^36+ and Mo^37+
   respectively, decrease strongly when the temperature drops, while the
   remaining spectrum (dominated by Mo^32+ transitions) is less affected.
   The detailed modeling of these transitions is discussed below.

                            [ECRH.spectcomp.GIF]



   High resolution synthetic spectra for Te = 3.8, 5.5 and 8.0 keV are
   shown in the three panels below; it should be noted that even if
   Gaussian shapes with a fwhm of 1.0 mÅ are assumed, blending still
   persists.  As can be seen, the spectra are sensitive to the
   temperature, both because of changing ionization state distribution
   and, to a lesser extent, due to the temperature dependence of the
   intensity of individual lines.  Each ion (from Mo^30+ to Mo^39+)
   carries information from the radial layer where it exists; studying
   these x-ray spectra we obtain spatial information over a large fraction
   of the minor radius (0<r/a<0.7 and T[e](0)=1-8 keV).  In particular,
   the features labeled a, b and g are typical of the higher temperature
   regime (T[e] > 3keV) and drop in intensity when the ECRH is switched
   off (see the spectra above); g is dominated by B-like Mo^37+ which
   exists in appreciable amounts only in plasmas with Te > 5 keV, while a
   and b are dominated by lines from N-like Mo^35+ and C-like Mo^36+,
   respectively.

                           [ECRH.synth.spect.GIF]

   The collisional-radiative model described above is used to reconstruct
   the measured molybdenum spectra knowing the electron temperature and
   density profiles. This is possible since the typical times, t, required
   for these ions to reach ionization equilibrium in this temperature and
   density range are a few milliseconds.  Since the central electron
   temperature reaches nearly its  peak value 20 ms (Dt) before the
   spectrum above is recorded (t ~ 0.1 s), the ions have enough time (Dt
   >> t) to reach  equilibrium.  Our goal is to simulate the full
   spectrum, and in particular the relative ratio of these features (a, b
   and g) with respect to the resonant lines at 4.8-4.9 Å from Mo^32+,
   Mo^31+ and Mo^30+.  (These features are better understood than those at
   4.5 - 4.6Å from Mo^34+ and Mo^33+.)  This ratio depends strongly on the
   total impurity profile, N[mo] (r).  The synthetic and experimental
   spectra are shown in the frames below for a peaked impurity profile
   (top) and for a flat one (bottom).  In the figure the continuous line
   represents the experimental spectrum, while the shadowed areas are the
   contributions of Mn and Cr K[a] in second order.

                           [ECRH.moprofs.comp.GIF]

   The (normalized) peaked impurity profile, N[mo] (r), is shown in the
   figure below together with the electron density profile.  The peaked
   profile produces a much better fit to the experimental spectrum.  This
   assessment of the impurity radial density profile is robust because it
   relies on agreement from all the emitting ions (Mo^39+ to Mo^30+), over
   the entire radial range 0 < r/a < 0.7 and not just on the "high
   temperature" features.  The calculated feature b in the spectra above
   is narrower and higher with respect to the measured one, but the
   integral is the same; this is due to spurious blending of several of
   the weak lines making up this feature.

                           [ECRH.Mo.Ne.profs.GIF]

   There are two results from this analysis that should be emphasized.  We
   find an impurity transport level much lower with respect to that one
   usually measured at FTU in the steady state.  For the spectra measured
   early in the discharge, the derived molybdenum charge state
   distribution is close to that given by coronal equilibrium.  Also, we
   find a central impurity accumulation early in the discharge.  These two
   results taken together are compatible with a neoclassical transport
   regime.  The absence in the core of impurity anomalous transport is an
   important result for this plasma regime of strong auxiliary heating.
   This result should be taken together with the good energy confinement
   property observed in previous work [27] studying the energy balance and
   the thermal conduction for the same shot, #12658.

   In contradistinction to the case above, a second discharge was studied
   in a different transport regime.  In this shot (#15505) ECRH heating
   off axis was used with double power (800 kW) on the same plasma
   target.  The Mo emission was analyzed at a later time (t=0.135 s) after
   the current flat top had been reached and the onset of the sawtooth
   instability (t=0.120 s).  The off axis heating and the presence of the
   sawtooth crashes produce a plateau in the central electron temperature
   (the temperature profile is shown above) and a much broader region
   emitting at high temperature.  We have applied the same method to
   simulate the experimental spectrum (thick pink line in the figure
   below).  The features a, b and g are well simulated with the emitting
   ions (Mo^35+ to Mo^39+) in coronal equilibrium.  Further, the relative
   ratio of these high temperature features with the line of Mo^32+ at 4.8
   Å is well reproduced with a flat total molybdenum profile, N[mo] (r).
   However, the features between 4.6 and 4.9 Å are not well simulated with
   the assumption of coronal equilibrium, in particular the lines emitted
   by Mo^31+ and Mo^30+ are underestimated. This implies that in the
   radial region where these two ions exist (r/a>0.3) anomalous transport
   is now present, reducing the degree of ionization.  Unlike the previous
   case, in this phase of the discharge the shear has become positive and
   the anomalous transport is growing, particularly in the half radius
   region.  This observation is in agreement with the results found above
   by deriving the impurity flux for Mo^31+.  In other work not reported
   upon here, the impurity transport is modeled as being driven by
   electrostatic turbulence [28] during the current flat top phase.

                             [ECRH.bestfit.GIF]

   We remark that molybdenum is an excellent diagnostic tool because it
   has several ions that emit strongly and have appropriate ionization
   times ( t ~ ms) in the temperature range up to 20 keV.  In particular
   the resonant lines of the B-, Be- and Li -like ions are bright and can
   be used as diagnostics of very high temperature plasmas in the same way
   the N-, C- and B-like ions have been used in the present work.  A
   synthetic spectrum for Mo^40+ to Mo^37+, both at high and low spectral
   resolution, is shown in the figure below.  The present experiments at
   FTU were performed with one and two gyrotrons; the installation of 4
   tubes with a total effective full power of 1.6 MW is now in progress.
   Consequently, in future experiments temperatures greatly in excess of 8
   keV are expected and other plasma scenarios will be accessible; these
   ions will provide an excellent diagnostic tool to study these plasmas.
