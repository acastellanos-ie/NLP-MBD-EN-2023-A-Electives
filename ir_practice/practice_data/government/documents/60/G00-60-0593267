Summary

   The Fisheries Statistics & Economics Division of the National Marine
   Fisheries Service (NMFS) has maintained a foreign trade data base for
   many years. We have developed a series of programs that can be used to
   summarize U.S. foreign trade in fishery products for the years 1975 to
   present. You can summarize the kilos and dollar value by your choice of
   years, products, countries, and the type of trade.

   Where does NMFS get this data?
   Well, like everyone else, we purchase the data from the Foreign Trade
   Division of the Bureau of the Census. Census is responsible for
   compiling the information submitted by importers and exporters to the
   U.S. Customs Service. The data are normally scheduled for release to
   the public 45 days after the close of the statistical month.

   Importers and exporters submit their transactions to the U.S. Customs
   Service using the international Harmonized Commodity Description and
   Coding System (HS). The HS is the system for classifying goods in
   international trade which has been developed under the auspices of the
   World Customs Organization (WCO), located in Brussels. The WCO is an
   international organization consisting of representatives of about 145
   countries. The U.S. is represented in the WCO by the U.S. Customs
   Service. The International Trade Commission maintains the Harmonized
   Tariff Schedule of the United States used by importers to classify
   their goods. Exporters use the Schedule B maintained by the Bureau of
   the Census.

   The following types of trade make up our data base:

   Imports Of Fishery Products: There are two methods for tracking
   imports. "General" imports are recorded when the commodity enters the
   country. Imports for "consumption" which are the data maintained in our
   data base are a combination of entries into the U.S. for immediate
   consumption and withdrawals from Customs bonded warehouses. These data
   reflect the actual entry into U.S. consumption channels of commodities
   that originated outside the United States.

   Exports Of Fishery Products: Exports may include merchandise of both
   domestic and foreign origin. Census defines exports of "domestic"
   merchandise to include commodities which are grown, produced, or
   manufactured in the United States. For statistical purposes, domestic
   exports also include commodities of foreign origin which have been
   changed in the U.S. from the form in which they were imported, or which
   have been enhanced in value by further manufacture in the Unites
   States.

   Re-Exports Of Fishery Products: Re-exports of "foreign" products are
   commodities which have entered the U.S. as imports and not sold, which,
   at the time of re-export, are in substantially the same condition as
   when imported. Items imported for sale in the U.S. but later resold
   overseas, however, are recorded as exports of domestic goods rather
   than as re-exports.

   Exactly what are the dollars?
   For exports and re-exports it is the f.a.s. (free alongside ship) value
   defined as the value at the port of export, based on the transaction
   price including inland freight, insurance and other charges incurred in
   placing the merchandise alongside the carrier. It excludes the cost of
   loading the merchandise, freight, insurance, and other charges or
   transportation costs beyond the port of exportation.

   For Imports it is the Customs value. This is generally defined as the
   price actually paid or payable for merchandise when sold for
   exportation to the United States, excluding U.S. import duties,
   freight, insurance and other charges incurred in bringing the
   merchandise to the United States. (This value approximates f.a.s.
   value.)
