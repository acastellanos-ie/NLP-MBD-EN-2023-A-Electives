   Customer and Employee Satisfaction Surveys
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) conducts statistically valid
   national customer satisfaction surveys of veterans and their families.
   These surveys are required by the Government Performance and Results
   Act (GPRA), and Executive Order 12862, Setting Customer Service
   Standards. All government agencies are mandated to create performance
   standards, including measures of customer service, and to survey
   customers regarding their level of satisfaction with the services and
   benefits provided.

   The Surveys conducted by VBA assess veterans' and their families.
   firsthand experiences with VA Compensation and Pension and Education
   claims, programs of Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment, as well as
   those with experience in buying a home with VA Loan Guaranty
   assistance. Copies of the latest customer survey reports, as well as
   short, in-depth analyses of some of those results, are available here.
   To read, copy, or download a copy of any of the reports, go to the type
   of survey shown on the left (e.g., Compensation & Pension, Education,
   etc.) and once on the appropriate page, click on the report you desire.

   The reports are rather lengthy, analyses are generally two to five
   pages in length, and both have many graphs. All reports have been
   converted to Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) files. To view PDF
   files, you must use Adobe's Acrobat Reader.

   Click on the links to the left for a free copy of Adobe Acrobat Reader.
   An accessible, text only, site for the visually impaired is also
   provided.
