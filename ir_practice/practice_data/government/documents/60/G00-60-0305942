   Message to Presidential Nominees and Appointees:

   In accordance with Executive Order 13176, we are forwarding the
   attached Presidential Transition Directory. This Directory will
   introduce you to the operation of the Federal Government and the
   resources available to help you begin your service in the new
   Administration.

   As a member of the new Administration, your work will have a tremendous
   impact on the lives of Americans. So, it is important to pay close
   attention to the rules and regulations that you must follow while in
   government service. These rules are designed to ensure that federal
   government employees perform their work in the most efficient and
   effective manner possible. We encourage you to rely on the career civil
   service in navigating these rules. These dedicated, hard-working men
   and women stand ready to serve you and the American people.

   We wish you the best as you begin your service in the federal
   government.
