     __________________________________________________________________

    1.   Purpose. This Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM) chapter
   describes the state forecast program, assigns responsibilities and
   establishes guidelines on the wording, content and format of the State
   Forecast Product (Automation of Field Operations and Services product
   category SFP). Written instructions cannot cover every situation.
   Operational personnel must use initiative and good professional
   judgment to minimize the risk to public safety and property in those
   conditions or events not covered by these or other instructions.

    Guidelines outlined in this chapter will be valid for offices through
   Stage 1 of the National Weather Service's (NWS) modernization and
   associated restructuring. This stage is characterized by the
   introduction of the Weather Surveillance Radar 1988 Doppler, which was
   developed by the Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) program, and the
   Automated Surface Observing System.

    2. Organizational Responsibilities.

    2.1  Weather Service Headquarters (WSH). Overall responsibility for
   the state forecast program rests with the Assistant Administrator for
   Weather Services. Staff assistance is provided by the Director, Office
   of Meteorology (OM) and its Warning and Forecast Branch.

    2.2  Regional Headquarters. Provides regional instructions based on
   guidelines found in this WSOM chapter and submits them to OM for
   approval before issuance. Ensures that the products are of high quality
   and adequately provide the information required by NWS users and the
   general public.

    2.3  Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO)/NEXRAD Weather Service
   Forecast Office (NWSFO). Prepares, issues and maintains quality control
   of state/area forecasts and updates as required. Also coordinates
   forecasts and warnings, as necessary, with Weather Service
   Office/NEXRAD Weather Service Offices within its area of forecast
   responsibility and with WSFO/NWSFOs having adjacent areas of forecast
   responsibility.

    3.  State Forecast Product (SFP) Definition. The SFP provides a
   general public forecast of hydrometeorological conditions over a
   WSFO/NWSFO's forecast area of responsibility for the next 5 days. The
   forecast area typically includes an entire state or part of one or more
   states. The 5-day SFP uses the discrete period format (see section 3.2)
   that is separated into a 1- and 2-day forecast section and a 3- to
   5-day extended forecast section.

    Zone forecasts are issued in the Alaska Region and island forecasts in
   the Pacific Region in lieu of state forecasts. The Alaska Region issues
   modified 3- to 5-day extended forecasts for certain population areas.

    3.1  SFP Issuance Times. The SFP shall be issued twice daily within
   the flexible window period allowed for the early morning and early
   evening zone forecast releases, typically 4 to 6 a.m./p.m. local time.

    3.2  SFP Format. The SFP should be in the discrete period format
   (except as noted in Guideline ^4 in this section) and use appropriate
   Universal Generic Codes (UGC) containing public zones. For the morning
   issuance, the periods begin with ".TODAY..." and for the evening
   issuance the periods begin with ".TONIGHT..." (see format examples in
   this section). For complete details on the UGC, see WSOM Chapter C-63,
   NOAA Weather Wire Service Dissemination.

    The format for the SFP shall occur in two versions.

    a. For SFPs that contain only one geographic forecast segment, the UGC
   shall be on the line immediately after the World Meteorological
   Organization (TTAA00 XXXX DDHHMM) line (see general format a).

    Offices using one geographic segment for their entire forecast area
   are the following.

   (1) Those that issue the SFP for their entire state (or an adjoining
   entire state). For these cases, the UGC takes the form SSZALL-DDHHMM-.

   (2) Those that issue the SFP for part of their state (in multiple
   WSFO/NWSFO states, such as New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, California)
   or part of an adjoining state. The UGC uses the appropriate public
   zones to differentiate areas.

   b. For regionally approved SFPs that contain two or more geographic
   forecast segments, the UGC and a suitable geographic name shall appear
   immediately before each separate geographic forecast segment followed
   by a double dollar ($$) delimiter after each segment (see general
   format b). The UGC uses the appropriate public zones to differentiate
   areas.

   At regional discretion, offices may use either format to provide the
   clearest and most understandable depiction of the forecast conditions.
   This option would be especially useful when weather conditions are
   significantly different across the forecast area. For example, an
   office that normally issues the SFP for its entire state (format a) may
   choose to break the area into two or m

   Format a. One Geographic Forecast Segment. This example uses a morning
   issuance.

    GUIDELINES:

    ^1 If the forecast area includes all zones in one or more states, use
   the "SSZALL-DDHHMM-" form of the UGC for each state. For example, if
   the states in the southern New England SFP were not subdivided, the UGC
   would be "MAZALL-CTZALL-RIZALL-DDHHMM-." The expiration time of the UGC
   in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) should be for the next scheduled
   issuance or approximately 12 hours later.

    ^2 For consistency, the SFP product title should take the form: "STATE
   FORECAST FOR COLORADO." See section 6.1 for a discussion on the use and
   placement of the terms "UPDATED" and "CORRECTED."

    ^3 Place the plain language identification of the forecast segment
   immediately after the UGC line, e.g.,

    FLZ001>004-DDHHMM-
   STATE FORECAST FOR NORTHWEST FLORIDA

   As in guideline ^2, the product title for each geographic part should
   take the form: "STATE FORECAST FOR (AREA)."

   ^4 The first 12-hour period (day 1) of any forecast segment shall not
   be combined with other periods in the 1- and 2-day section. Strive to
   keep the other periods of the SFP separate. You may combine the other
   periods within each forecast section--only when the significant weather
   elements are similar. Do not combine periods inappropriately just to
   keep the SFP short. Periods in the extended forecast section shall not
   be combined with periods in the 1- and 2-day forecast section.

   3.3  General SFP Content. The SFP should concentrate on the most
   significant hydrometeorological conditions expected to affect major
   parts or all of the forecast area to keep the forecast from becoming
   unnecessarily complicated. In general, more detail should be found in
   the 1- and 2-day section than in the 3- to 5-day section of the
   forecast.

   When significant conditions are expected in only part of the forecast
   area, this should be clearly specified. If the weather distribution is
   caused by topography, generally accepted topographic divisions, such as
   mountains, valleys, coast, shore, Plains, etc., should be used. In
   other cases, commonly understood subdivision terms, such as
   "panhandle," or general phrases, such as "northwest Iowa" or "southeast
   Texas" may be used. Long and/or confusing combinations should be
   avoided.

   3.4  1- and 2-Day Forecast Section Content. The 1- and 2-day forecast
   section provides less detail than that found in zone and local
   forecasts (see WSOM Chapter C-11, Zone and Local Forecasts) but more
   than in the 3- to 5-day extended forecast section. The 1- and 2-day
   forecast section consists of 12-hour forecast periods (up to 48 hours).
   The day period extends from about 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time, and the
   night period extends from about 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time. These
   periods should normally include the following weather elements.

   a. Headline(s) of long lead time warnings (tornado, severe
   thunderstorm, and flood/flash flood warnings normally excluded) and
   watches and advisories.

   In general, headlines for SFPs should be very brief and held to one
   sentence and no more than two lines if possible. They are used by
   broadcasters to catch users' attention. Typically, headlines should
   provide summary information of the "what," "where," and "when" of the
   event(s), especially when multiple warnings, watches, or advisories are
   in effect, e.g., "...WINTER STORM WARNINGS...WATCHES AND ADVISORIES ARE
   IN EFFECT TODAY FOR MOST OF NORTH DAKOTA...". Specific details of the
   events would be found in relevant warnings, watches, advisories, and
   other products.

   b. Precipitation, if any.

   c. Maximum or minimum temperature as appropriate and, if significant,
   temperature trend.

   d. State of the sky but should be omitted if it can be inferred from
   the forecast of precipitation.

   e. Wind, if significant (generally sustained 25 mph or greater).

   f. Other elements, if considered significant, e.g., wind chill, heat
   and humidity, frost, fog, other obstructions to visibility, etc.

   3.5  3- to 5-Day Extended Forecast Content. The 3- to 5-day forecast
   section consists of 24-hour forecast periods. These periods provide
   predominant weather and temperature generally for the calendar day
   (midnight to midnight--see NOTE below) and should be a coherent
   extension of the 1- and 2-day forecast section. Specifically, these
   periods should normally include the following weather elements.

   a. Precipitation, if any, or indication of no precipitation.

   b. Early morning low temperature should be mentioned first followed by
   the daytime high and, if significant, temperature trend.

   c. State of the sky may be mentioned but should be omitted if it can be
   inferred from the forecast of precipitation.

   NOTE: Although extended forecast periods emphasize weather elements
   generally for the calendar day, forecasters should note that the valid
   times for National Meteorological Center extended forecast guidance
   include: minimum temperature from 0000 UTC to 1200 UTC; maximum
   temperature from 1200 UTC to 0000 UTC; and the probability of
   precipitation from 0000 UTC to 0000 UTC.

   Because the last 12-hour period (day 2) of the 1- and 2-day forecast
   section nominally ends about 6 p.m. local time and the first period
   (day 3) of the extended forecast section nominally begins about
   midnight local time, there is a resultant 6-hour gap. Normally, weather
   during this time can be accounted for in either day 2 or day 3.

   At regional discretion, however, offices may begin the 3- to 5-day
   extended forecast section with a separate 12-hour nighttime period that
   follows the 1- and 2-day forecast section. This separate period
   optionally can be used to highlight important events, such as the
   beginning or ending of precipitation, sharply rising or falling
   temperatures, etc.

   Example:

   TTAA00 KTOP 111020
   KSZALL-112230-

   .TODAY...(text)
   .TONIGHT...(text)
   .THURSDAY...RAIN CHANGING TO SNOW. HIGHS 35 TO 40.

   .EXTENDED FORECAST...
   .THURSDAY NIGHT...SNOW ENDING. LOWS IN THE UPPER 20S. .FRIDAY...COLD
   AND HIGHS IN THE LOWER 30S.

   .SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...PARTLY CLOUDY AND NOT AS COLD. LOWS IN THE 30S
   AND HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40S.

   4.  SFP Wording and Writing Style Guidelines.

   4.1  General. Effective wording of forecasts is a difficult but
   essential part of the forecaster's job. As with all NWS messages
   intended for the public, forecasters should strive for clarity and
   brevity in the SFP. This may mean sacrificing technical purity or
   eliminating certain details to produce the most easily understood text.
   Use plain language, not abbreviations and contractions except for wind
   speed (mph).

   In fast-breaking or hazardous situations, the forecaster should use a
   writing style that conveys a sense of immediacy or urgency.
   Appropriately, the forecaster is encouraged to use more descriptive
   phrasing or more definitive timing of events (especially) in the first
   period as long as the forecast remains clear and easily understood. For
   further guidelines on writing style, see WSOM Chapter C-11.

   While the guidelines in the sections below apply broadly to all periods
   of the SFP, they are most applicable to the 1- and 2-day forecast
   section. For further guidelines on forecast content and wording, see
   WSOM Chapter C-11.

   4.2  Stress Important Elements. Emphasize the most significant elements
   first, e.g., precipitation, high winds, heat or cold, etc. Eliminate
   less important elements if that aids in a clear and easily
   understandable message, e.g., state of the sky if it can be inferred
   from the forecast text.

   4.3  Highlight Significant Changes. Emphasize significant changes in
   important elements of the forecast first, e.g., "MUCH COLDER," "SNOW
   ENDING," "FREEZING RAIN BEGINNING," etc. Do not overlook the
   opportunity to highlight the resumption of pleasant weather after a
   duration of inclement or uncomfortable weather.

   Example:

   LITSFPAR
   TTAA00 KLIT 211057
   ARZALL-212300-

   STATE FORECAST FOR ARKANSAS
   NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
   500 AM CST TUE JAN 21 1992

   .TODAY...TURNING WINDY AND MUCH COLDER NORTH WITH AFTERNOON
   TEMPERATURES FALLING INTO THE 30S. SHOWERS AND OCCASIONAL THUNDERSTORMS
   SOUTH ENDING LATE IN THE DAY. HIGHS IN THE 60S BUT TURNING SHARPLY
   COLDER IN THE EVENING.

    .TONIGHT...WINDY AND VERY COLD STATEWIDE WITH LOWS NEAR 10 ABOVE IN
   THE NORTH TO THE 20S SOUTH.

   .WEDNESDAY...SUNNY AND VERY COLD. HIGHS IN THE TEENS EXCEPT 20S SOUTH.

   .EXTENDED FORECAST...
   .THURSDAY...INCREASING CLOUDS AND NOT AS COLD. LOWS IN THE 20S AND
   HIGHS IN THE 30S.
   .FRIDAY...CHANCE OF RAIN EXCEPT POSSIBLE SNOW NORTH. LOWS IN THE 30S.
   HIGHS IN THE 30S NORTH AND 40S SOUTH.
   .SATURDAY...PARTLY CLOUDY AND COOL. LOWS IN THE 30S AND HIGHS IN THE
   40S.

   4.4  Warning, Watch and Advisory Situations. Place longer lead-time
   warnings, watches, and advisories in a headline preceding and separate
   from the forecast text. Include the period and the area covered by the
   warning, watch, or advisory in the headline. If only a part of the
   forecast area is affected, include it in the headline, e.g., "...WINTER
   STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHEAST TONIGHT...", "...TORNADO
   WATCH IN EFFECT FOR EASTERN (STATE/AREA/COUNTIES) THIS MORNING...",
   "...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FOR (AREA) TODAY...". Further
   details on the use of warnings, watches, and advisories in SFPs are in
   WSOM Chapters C-40, Severe Local Storm Warnings; C-41, Hurricane
   Warnings; C-42, Winter Weather Warnings; C-43, Coastal Flood Warnings;
   C-44, Non-precipitation Weather Hazards; and E-20, Flood/Flash Flood
   and Warning Program. Also, see section 3.4 for further guidelines on
   the use of headlines.

   4.5  Emphasize Unusual Weather. Dangerous or unusual
   hydrometeorological conditions should be emphasized by mentioning the
   appropriate elements first. Less important elements can be eliminated.
   Most importantly, use wording that effectively highlights the event.

   Example:

   NEWSFPLA
   TTAA00 KNEW 162057
   LAZALL-170900-

   STATE FORECAST FOR LOUISIANA
   NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE NEW ORLEANS LA

   THUNDERSTORMS WITH WIND GUSTS TO 40 MPH ACROSS THE REST OF THE STATE.
   LOWS IN THE 70S.
   .THURSDAY...WINDY WITH OCCASIONAL GUSTS TO 40 MPH. SCATTERED SHOWERS
   AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 70S TO LOWER 80S.
    .THURSDAY NIGHT...PARTLY CLOUDY...WARM AND HUMID. LOWS IN THE 70S.
   .FRIDAY...SUNNY...VERY WARM AND HUMID. HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER
   90S.

   .EXTENDED FORECAST...

   .SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...WARM AND HUMID NIGHTS AND SUNNY HOT DAYS. LOWS
   IN THE 70S AND HIGHS IN THE 90S.
   .MONDAY...CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND COOLER. LOWS IN THE 60S AND HIGHS IN
   THE 70S.

   5.  Wording Individual Elements.

   5.1  Precipitation. "1- and 2-day forecast section"--when precipitation
   is forecast, specify and, if necessary, qualify its type and intensity,
   e.g., "LIGHT RAIN," "HEAVY SNOW," etc. "SPRINKLES," "DRIZZLE," or "SNOW
   FLURRIES" may be used for very light precipitation. The approximate
   time for the beginning and ending of precipitation should be mentioned.
   The percent categories of probability of precipitation (POP) at points
   within the state/area shall not be used. In its place, include the
   following: POP qualifying terms of uncertainty, e.g., "CHANCE,"
   "LIKELY," etc.; appropriate modifying terms to describe the amount of
   area to be affected, e.g., for convective situations, "FEW,"
   "WIDESPREAD," etc.; and for stratiform precipitation, terms of
   duration, e.g., "BRIEF," "OCCASIONAL," "FREQUENT," etc. To avoid the
   appearance of hedging, do not use statements, such as "FEW BRIEF LIGHT
   SHOWERS" or "A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS." Instead use "A FEW LIGHT
   SHOWERS" or "A FEW SHOWERS" or "SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS" or "SCATTERED
   SHOWERS."

   For definitions of freezing and frozen precipitation (and related)
   terms, undesirable precipitation terms, mixed and multiple
   precipitation events, and snow accumulation, see WSOM Chapter C-11.

   "3- to 5-day forecast sections"-- because of the decreasing levels of
   skill inherent in forecasts for the extended periods, a general
   statement of precipitation type should be provided, including
   appropriate uncertainty. For example, in most situations "CHANCE OF
   RAIN" (or "SNOW") should suffice. Forecasters normally should not use
   "LIKELY" or categorical terms of absolute certainty, such as "RAIN,"
   "SNOW," "OCCASIONAL," "INTERMITTENT," etc. The time of occurrence of
   precipitation normally should be specified only to the nearest day.

   5.2  Temperature. For each day and night period (in the 1- and 2-day
   forecast section), include the expected maximum and minimum
   temperature, respectively (see 5.2.2 for variations because of rising
   nighttime or falling daytime temperatures). For each 24-hour period (in
   the 3- to 5-day extended forecast section), include a general statement
   of expected maximum and minimum temperatures. To improve user
   comprehension, you may include descriptive words or phrases of
   temperature along with the numerical values, such as "SUNNY AND COLD
   WITH HIGHS IN THE 20S," etc. In addition, include a statement of the
   temperature change (trend), when considered significant (i.e., highs or
   lows varying by about 10 degrees or more than previous highs or lows)
   or informative, e.g., "MUCH WARMER WITH LOWS IN THE 70S AND HIGHS IN
   THE 80S," etc.

   The statement on forecast temperatures should be as simple as possible,
   yet it should note the extremes that exist. It is not intended that
   every variance in temperature be covered; in some mountainous, coastal,
   or hilly areas, the full delineation of temperature extremes in
   impractical.

   5.2.1  Temperature Presentation. Numerical temperature values should be
   presented in either of the following two ways.

   a. A general range where the terms are defined as follows.

   "LOWER 50S" (50, 51, 52, 53)
   "MID 50S" (54, 55, 56)
   "UPPER 50S" (57, 58, 59)
   "60S" (60 through 69)

   b. A specific range--rounded to the nearest 5 or zero. For ranges below
   10 or above 100, any numbers may be used.

   "40 TO 45"
   "5 BELOW TO 15 BELOW"
   "102 TO 108"

   NOTES:

   1. Care must be taken when using a specific range; too many numbers can
   confuse users.

   2. The range should be kept as small as possible.

   3. Do not use such expressions as "LOWS IN THE 50S TO AROUND 60" or
   "MOSTLY IN THE 50S." Instead, say "LOWS IN THE 50S" or "LOWS 50 TO 60."

   4. Do not use the narrative form in expressions, such as "HIGHS IN THE
   LOW ONE HUNDREDS" or "HIGHS ABOVE ONE HUNDRED." Instead, use a specific
   number, such as "HIGHS NEAR 108," or a specific range, such as "HIGHS
   107 TO 112."

   5. Do not use potentially confusing expressions, such as "HIGHS IN THE
   LOW 70S." Instead, say "HIGHS IN THE LOWER 70S" or "HIGHS 70 TO 75."

   5.2.2  Falling Daytime, Rising Nighttime, or Steady Temperatures. If
   the temperature is expected to fall throughout the day or rise
   throughout the night or remain steady, indicate the temperature
   expected at the end of that specified time (primarily in the
   appropriate periods in the 1- and 2-day forecast section). Use phrases
   such as the following.

   o ".TODAY...MUCH COOLER WITH TEMPERATURES FALLING INTO THE 40S THIS
   AFTERNOON."

   o ".TOMORROW...TEMPERATURES REMAINING IN THE 60S."

   o ".TONIGHT...SLOWLY RISING TEMPERATURES REACHING THE 30S BY MORNING."

   5.3  Wind. Generally, wind is not mentioned in the SFP unless
   considered significant. Significant wind will vary from state to state,
   but as a general rule, sustained speeds should be at or above 25 mph.
   The following are suggested terms to use when sustained speeds are:
   20-30 mph, "WINDY;" 30-40 mph, "VERY WINDY;" 40 mph or more, "STRONG,"
   "DAMAGING," "DANGEROUS" or "HIGH." When above 40 mph, a high wind
   warning is required in the headline (see WSOM Chapter C-44). When wind
   is mentioned in the SFP, specific wind speed and direction may be
   included, e.g., ".TODAY...BECOMING MUCH COLDER AND WINDY. TEMPERATURES
   FALLING INTO THE 20S AND NORTHWEST WINDS TO 30 MPH." Lighter wind
   speeds may be used if a particular situation warrants.

   5.4  Sky Condition. At regional discretion, the SFP may include
   information about the state of the sky in any period. State of the sky
   should be omitted, however, if its inclusion would unnecessarily
   complicate or lengthen the forecast or if it can readily be inferred
   from the precipitation or other forecast wording. See WSOM Chapter C-11
   for basic terms used to define sky condition, e.g., "MOSTLY CLOUDY"
   means 7/10 to 8/10 opaque clouds; and terms that can be construed as
   hedging and should not be used, e.g., "FAIR TO PARTLY CLOUDY," etc.

   5.5  Other Elements. Include fog, other visibility restrictions, frost,
   freeze conditions, humidity, etc., with appropriate emphasis whenever
   these elements are important features of the weather story. For
   example, include fog whenever it is dense enough to contribute to
   hazardous driving conditions. Mention frost if it is expected to affect
   a large part of the forecast area.

   6.  Updates. In general, update the SFP when developing weather events
   are not adequately reflected in the forecast. This would most likely
   occur for changes in the 1- and 2-day forecast section. While some
   update criteria are listed below, they are not all inclusive. There
   ultimately is no substitute for good forecaster judgment in deciding
   when to update.

   6.1  Definitions and Formats. The terms "UPDATED" and "CORRECTED" shall
   be appended to SFPs according to the following definitions.

    o UPDATED shall be used on all nonroutine SFP issuances to indicate
   either some forecast element(s) and/or some wording has been changed to
   reflect more accurately changing weather conditions (see update
   criteria in section 6.2).

   o CORRECTED shall be used on all routine or nonroutine SFP issuances to
   indicate an error (typographic, mislabeling, etc., not forecaster
   judgment) was made in the previously issued forecast. The forecaster
   should review the SFP carefully before issuance to reduce the number of
   products needing correction.

   When an update or correction is needed, reissue the entire SFP. The
   terms "UPDATED" or "CORRECTED," preceded by three dots (...) shall be
   appended to the product identification line in the mass news
   disseminator header as shown in the examples below. As an important aid
   to users, a brief (usually one line) reason for the update or
   correction should also be added as shown in the examples. Note that for
   either format a or b, the reason for the update or correction occurs in
   the same place.

   Examples:

   Format a.

   6.2 Update Criteria. Updates should be issued as soon as practical
   under the following circumstances.

   a. A winter weather watch or warning is issued for all or part of the
   forecast area (see WSOM Chapter C-42).

   b. A hurricane watch or warning is issued for all or part of the
   forecast area (see WSOM Chapter C-41).

   c. A coastal flood watch or warning and/or high surf advisory is issued
   for part of the forecast area (see WSOM Chapter C-43).

   d. Beginning or ending of widespread precipitation over all or part of
   the forecast area does not match current forecast.

   e. Type of widespread precipitation changes from that indicated in the
   current forecast, e.g., rain to snow, liquid to freezing, etc.

   f. Temperatures or winds vary significantly from those in the forecast.

   g. For tornado, severe thunderstorm, and flash flood situations, use
   the following guidelines. Generally, SFPs need not be updated to
   include short-fuse warnings (tornado, severe thunderstorm, or flash
   flood).


                                         Update at forecaster's
   If forecast includes:                          Always update for:
                       discretion for:
   Severe thunderstorms*                   Flash Flood Watch

   possible flooding                            Tornado Watch

   ______________

   * Offices are strongly encouraged to add the phrase "WITH LARGE HAIL
   AND DAMAGING WINDS" to the term "SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS" when used in
   forecasts.
