   NICHD Strategic Plan 2000: From Cells to Selves

   The NICHD supports strategic planning to ensure that issues which are
   critical to our mission are adequately addressed in the research that
   we support. The strategic areas that provide the framework for our plan
   represent:
     * Topics in which there are significant knowledge gaps
     * Emerging scientific and technological opportunities that can
       benefit from concentrated resources
     * Public health concerns that require new strategic, coordinated, and
       multidisciplinary efforts and
     * Populations who were underrepresented in past research projects.

   The NICHD strategic plan is divided into several documents. From Cells
   to Selves (230 KB in PDF format) - provides the overall framework and
   goals to guide the Institutes long-term planning process. Published in
   1999, this document is supported by separate research agendas which are
   in various stages of production. Completed documents may be accessed
   either on-line or printed copies may be ordered from our Clearinghouse.
   New plans will be posted for public comment as they become available:
     * Health Disparities: Bridging the Gap (850KB in PDF format) -
       provides a research agenda to help reduce or eliminate health
       disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations.
     * Genetics and Fetal Antecedents of Disease Susceptibility (173KB in
       PDF format) - provides a research agenda to ensure that new
       technologies are used to understand the biological, environmental
       and other factors contributing to disease susceptibility.
     * Reproductive Health for the 21st Century (181KB in PDF format) -
       provides a research agenda to increase our knowledge about
       reproductive processes to overcome infertility and ensure
       successful pregnancies and healthy birth outcomes.
     * Biobehavioral Development (199KB in PDF format) - provides a
       research agenda to increase our understanding of the processes
       involved in forming cognitive, learning, emotional, social, and
       physical behaviors and in the rehabilitation of persons with
       physical and developmental disabilities.
     * Developmental Biology Understanding Normal and Abnormal Development
       (139KB in PDF format) - provides a research agenda to study early
       development in utero and to prevent birth defects.
     * Targeting Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) : A Strategic Plan
       (968KB in PDF format) - provides a research agenda to increase our
       knowledge of SIDS, its origins, etiology, pathogenesis,
       diagnostics, and prognostics, as well as preventive strategies and
       interventions.
