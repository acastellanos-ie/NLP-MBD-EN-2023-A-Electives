     The Fraud Division coordinates Automobile Fraud investigations
     statewide, provides assistance to law enforcement agencies, and
     presents prosecutable auto fraud cases to District Attorneys offices
     and the US Attorneys office.

     From 10% to 20% of all auto claims are estimated by the industry and
     prosecutors to arise from fraud. In Southern California, experts
     cite 25% to 50% of all auto insurance claims as fraudulent.
     According to the President/CEO of the Auto Club of Southern
     California, auto insurance fraud costs consumers in California as
     much as $500 million annually.

     Automobile insurance fraud in California has historically taken
     several forms:
     * Automobile Property

     Insureds and/or body shops fraudulently report that parts of
     vehicles have been damaged or lost, when in fact they have not.
     Insureds have fraudulently reported their vehicles stolen or
     vandalized in order to collect on insurance.

     * Staged Automobile Accidents

     These so called "accidents," which are not accidents at all, involve
     several basic schemes including:

     * Swoop and Squat

     Innocent victims (private motorists, truck drivers, business van,
     etc.) are targeted by organized auto accident rings. These rings
     orchestrate an accident by using preplanned maneuvers to set up an
     innocent party for a rear end collision. Innocent motorists may be
     involved as victims in this scheme.

     * Paper Accident

     Organized rings and "cappers" actively solicit others in the
     community to participate in the creation of accidents that only
     exist on paper. No innocent parties are involved in this type of
     staged accident.

     Over the past several years, there has been a noticeable shift from
     swoop and squat accidents to paper accidents. The reasons cited:
     they are less dangerous to the perpetrators; there is less
     likelihood of police involvement; and there is no apparent lack of
     persons willing to participate.

     The number of suspected auto insurance fraud cases referred to the
     Fraud Division has tripled since 1991. Many of these cases involve
     organized criminal enterprises, or "rings," that prey upon the
     motoring public. A total of 13,908 auto-related Suspected Fraudulent
     Claims (SFC's) were reported in fiscal year 1993-1994; 11,559 SFC's
     in fiscal year1994-1995, 13,161 SFC's in fiscal year 1995-1996;
     14,449 SFC's in fiscal year 1996-1997, and 14,840 SFC's in fiscal
     year 1997-1998.

     During fiscal year 1996-1997, the Division opened 475 new cases and
     arrested 290 suspects.

     During fiscal year 1997-1998, the Division opened 295 new cases and
     arrested 418 suspects.

     California law provides targeted funding to fight automobile
     insurance fraud. In 1991, legislation increased the per vehicle
     fraud assessment from fifty cents to $1.00 for each insured vehicle.
     The funding provides resources to both county prosecutors and the
     Fraud Division to investigate and prosecute auto insurance fraud.
     The law also requires that all insurers establish and maintain
     Special Investigative Units (SIU's) to investigate fraudulent claim
     practices.
