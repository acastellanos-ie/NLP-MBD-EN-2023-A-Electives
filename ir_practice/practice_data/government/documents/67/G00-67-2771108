        * IUPAP International Conference on Women in Physics
          Indianapolis, Indiana: March 7-9, 2002.
          The primary purpose of this conference is to understand the severe
          under-representation of women worldwide and to develop strategies
          to increase their participation in physics. The conference will
          serve as an initial focal point for ongoing activities to implement
          these strategies. It is the first international conference to be
          held on this topic. See the conference Web site at
          www.if.ufrgs.br/%7Ebarbosa/conference.html.
        * March Meeting of the American Physical Society
          Indianapolis, Indiana: March 18-22, 2002.
          This meeting will deal with topics from the divisions of Condensed
          Matter Physics; Materials Physics; High Polymer Physics; Chemical
          Physics; Biological Physics; Fluid Dynamics; Laser Science and
          Computational Physics; and Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics.
          Topical Groups covered include Instrument and Measurement Science,
