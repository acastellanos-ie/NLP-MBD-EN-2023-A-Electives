                                 Volunteers

   The Savings Bonds Program relies on the support of thousands of
   volunteers in communities, business and government throughout the
   country to inform the American public about the importance of saving
   and about U.S. Savings Bonds. Executive volunteers serve as members of
   the U.S. Savings Bonds Volunteer Committee and Area Campaign Chairs,
   organized according to their community or geographic affiliations. In
   addition, many community leaders serve in other capacities, and
   thousands of people serve as volunteer canvassers for payroll campaigns
   where they work.

   The Savings Bonds Program would not be able to accomplish its goals and
   purposes each year without your support and assistance. We value your
   assistance greatly and thank you for it.

   This page provides information and tools to support you in your
   volunteer service, especially those of you who are leading campaigns.
   We welcome your ideas about how to make it serve you better - just drop
   us a line at SBMarket@bpd.treas.gov.
