The Research Library

   What most readily defines a "state" library -- and distinguishes it
   from a public or university library -- is its legal mandate to serve
   the executive, legislative and judicial branches of its state's
   government. To carry out this mandate, the New York State Library
   maintains extensive holdings in law and subjects related to public
   policy, and State and local history. The Library is also a depository
   for both New York State and Federal government documents.

Ongoing Research Projects

     * New Netherlands Project: The primary objective of the project is to
       complete the transcription, translation, and publication of Dutch
       documents relating to the seventeenth-century colony of New
       Netherland. The project is jointly sponsored by the State Library
       and the Holland Society of New York.
     * New York State Newspaper Project: The Newspaper Project identifies,
       describes, preserves, and makes available to researchers the
       significant newspapers in all communities in New York State since
       the first publication of 'The New-York Gazette' in 1725. This
       effort is part of a larger national program, the United States
       Newspaper Program, which supports projects in each of the fifty
       states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
       Islands.
