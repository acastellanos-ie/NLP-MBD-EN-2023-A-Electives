   The FCC Search Engine searches throughout the FCC's web site, including
   the Electronic Document Management System (EDOCS), but does not collect
   information from the FCC's other databases and electronic filing
   systems such as the Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS).
   Information is collected from web pages and many types of documents
   including Word, WordPerfect, Acrobat, Excel, and ASCII Text, and is
   constantly updated.
