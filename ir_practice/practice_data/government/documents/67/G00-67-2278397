   Aviation Safety, Security, and System Efficiency
   Safety Security System Efficiency Highlights
      Aviation Safety, Security, and System Efficiency - Strategic Goals,
      Plans, and Programs

      In the fall of 1997, the newly appointed FAA Administrator and her
      senior management team completed work on the goals that have carried
      the FAA and aerospace into the new millenium. The updated 2001 FAA
      Strategic Plan lays out these goals, areas for strategic focus,
      projects to implement them, and outcome measures.

      The FAA Strategic Plan is focused around three mission goals: safety,
      security,and system efficiency.

   Safety

      Strategic Goal: By 2007, reduce U.S. aviation fatal accident rates by
      80 percent from 1996 levels.
        * Fatal Aircraft Accident Rate: By 2007, reduce the U.S. aviation
          fatal accident rate per aircraft departure, as measured by a year
          moving average, by 80 percent from the year average for 1994-1996.
        * Overall Aircraft Accident Rate: Reduce the rate per aircraft
          departure.
        * Fatalities and Losses by Type of Accident: Reduce the number and
          type of fatalities and losses from accidents that occur for each
          major type of accident.
        * Occupant Risk: Reduce the risk of mortality to a passenger or
          flight crew member on a typical flight.

      FY 2001 Performance Goals:
        * Commercial Air Carrier Fatal Aircraft Rate. Reduce the fatal
          commercial aviation fatal accident rate per100,000 departures to
          0.043 by FY 2001.
        * General Aviation Fatal Accidents:Limit the number of fatal general
          aviation accidents to 379 for FY 2001.
        * Runway Incursions: Reduce the number of runway incursions to 248,
          or .381 per 100,000 operations in FY 2001.
          Operational Errors :Reduce the rate of operational errors per
          100,000 facility activities to 0.5 in FY 2001.

   Security

      Strategic Goal: Prevent security incidents in the aviation system.
        * No Security Incidents."Security incidents" means criminal or
          terrorist acts against commercial passenger air transportation that
          is subject to security regulation during which weapons, firearms,
          incendiary or explosive devices are used. These acts must result in
          hijackings, sabotage, bombings, aircraft piracy, or attacks within
          the secured areas of airports that could cause fatalities or
          serious injuries. This definition excludes: Hoax hijackings or bomb
          threats; unruly passengers; and international disruptions in air
          traffic service.
        * Explosive Device and Weapons Detection: Improve the ability to
          detect improvised explosive devices and weapons that may be brought
          aboard aircraft.
        * Airport Security: Prevent unauthorized access to aircraft and
          improve security at airports by a specified* percentage from a 1999
          baseline index derived from assessments and tests.
        * Airway Facility Risk: Increase the number of FAA facilities fully
          accredited as meeting security standards to a specified* percent.

      FY 2001 Performance Goal:
        * Explosive Device and Weapons Detection: Increase the detection rate
          for explosives and weapons that may be brought aboard aircraft.

      * Specified improvements and baselines are protected under C.F.R. Part
      191.


   System Efficiency

      Strategic Goal: Provide an aerospace transportation system that meets
      the needs of users and is efficient in the application of FAA and
      aerospace resources.
        * System Availability: Increase the percentage of time a typical
          major facility or service is available to users of the National
          Airspace System.
        * System Delays: Reduce the rate of aviation system delays, and
          especially the volume- and equipment-related delays over which FAA
          has more direct control, from a 1992-1996 baseline.

      FY 2001 Performance Goals:
        * Aviation Delays: Reduce the rate of air travel delays by 5.5% from
          a 1992-1996 baseline of 181 delays per 100,000 activities. The FY
          2001 target is 171 per 100,000 facility activities.
        * Runway Pavement Condition: Maintain in good or fair condition at
          least 93 percent of runways at all commercial service airports and
          reliever airports, as well as selected general aviation airports.
        * All Weather Access to Airports: Increase the number of runways that
          are accessible in low visibility conditions from a FY 1999
          baseline. The target for FY 2001 is 1,192 runways, an increase of
          108.
          Capacity and Direct Routings: Increase airport capacity and en
          route direct routings due to effects of the Free Flight program. In
          FY 2001, 1) Increase capacity 3 percent during peak periods at the
          Minneapolis-St. Paul and Los Angeles airports, and 2) increase
          direct routings 15 percent above pre-User Request Evaluation Tool
          (URET) 2-way Host installation levels at the Memphis and
          Indianapolis en route centers.
