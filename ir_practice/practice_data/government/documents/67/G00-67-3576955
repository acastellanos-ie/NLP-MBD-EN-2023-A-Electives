   2001 Title 24, Part 6
   California's Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and
   Nonresidential Buildings

   [efficiency_logo.jpg] The Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential
   and Nonresidential Buildings were established in 1978 in response to a
   legislative mandate to reduce California's energy consumption. The
   standards are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible
   incorporation of new energy efficiency technologies and methods. New
   standards were adopted by the Commission in 2001 as mandated by
   Assembly Bill 970 to reduce California's electricity demand. The new
   standards went into effect on June 1, 2001.

   The standards (along with standards for energy efficient appliances)
   have saved more than $20 billion in electricity and natural gas costs.
   It is estimated the standards will save $57 billion by 2011.

   The standards may be downloaded or, to obtain a hard copy, contact the
   Energy Commission's publications unit at 916-654-5200.
