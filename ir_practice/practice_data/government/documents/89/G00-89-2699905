      The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Waste Management Program
      (WMP) is committed to becoming a "best of class" waste management
      program and is in transition to this end. The characteristics of a best
      of class waste management program have been identified by the WMP
      working in concert with the Department of Energy (DOE).
      To be best of class, the Los Alamos waste management program must
      demonstrate to DOE and our stakeholders that it is better than
      commercial waste management facilities and better than other DOE waste
      management programs providing similar services and facilities by having
      the six best of class characteristics listed below. The Los Alamos
      waste management program is on track to having these characteristics by
      2002 at the very latest, subject to funding levels provided by DOE. The
      program will achieve best of class status when the following goals are
      met:

        [gold_button.gif] Cost-Effective Operations: Total costs and costs
        per unit of waste managed, as measured by benchmarking and process
        improvement studies, are the lowest among the facilities and
        programs that are similar to those at Los Alamos.
        [gold_button.gif] Aggressive Legacy Waste Reduction Program: The Los
        Alamos legacy reduction program must address two different types of
        waste-- TRU and MLLW. Each type of waste requires separate legacy
        waste reduction activities and objectives.
        For TRU our objective is to begin shipping waste to WIPP during
        FY98.
        For MLLW our objective is that by September 2003, Los Alamos will
        have all 600 cubic meters of LLMW that was in storage as of October
        1995 treated and properly disposed. Beginning in 1999 all newly
        generated MLLW properly disposed of within a year of being
        generated.
        [gold_button.gif] Uninterrupted Compliant Mission Services: The
        waste management program supports the Laboratory's missions and
        programs through cost-effective and compliant management of the
        waste that is generated.
        [gold_button.gif] Minimal Amounts of Waste to be Managed: The
        Laboratory is focused on generator waste minimization and
        environmental stewardship rather than "end-of-pipe" waste
        management. The generators embrace and financially support waste
        minimization practices in all activities so that the minimum amount
        of waste is released to the environment.
        [gold_button.gif] Effective Management: Responsible Laboratory
        management has driven and is maintaining the program as best of
        class, as measured by the other 5 characteristics and objectives.
        [gold_button.gif] DOE and Stakeholder Confidence: Stakeholders are
        engaged in waste management decision making activities.
