   Ozone & Water Vapor Group (OZWV)

      The Ozone and Water Vapor Group conducts research on the nature and
      causes of the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer and the role
      of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone and water vapor in forcing
      climate change and in modifying the chemical cleansing capacity of the
      atmosphere. This mission is accomplished through long-term observations
      and intensive field programs that measure total column ozone, ozone
      vertical profiles (ozonesondes and umkehrs), ground level ozone, and
      water vapor vertical profiles in the upper troposphere and stratosphere
      and through transport modeling with isentropic trajectories.


      Atmospheric Transport - An isentropic trajectory model is used to
    characterize atmospheric transport with an emphasis on understanding
      the role of transport on the distribution of trace species in the
   atmosphere. Trajectories for a number of locations can be obtained from
                               this web site.
   Ozonesondes - Ozone profiles are obtained routinely (usually weekly) at
   eight sites using balloon-borne, electrochemical (ECC) ozonesondes. The
   profiles provide ozone, temperature, and humidity information from the
    surface to approximately 32 km. Both stratospheric ozone depletion at
      the South Pole, and anthropogenic and natural tropospheric ozone
                            changes are studied.
      Stratospheric Aerosols - LIDARS at Mauna Loa and Boulder measure
      profiles of particles in the troposphere and stratosphere. In the
     troposphere the particles can result from long range transport from
     natural or pollution sources. In the stratosphere the particles are
                        primarily volcanic in origin.
    Surface Ozone - Near ground level ozone is currently monitored using
    ultraviolet absorption photometers at eight sites that are generally
     representative of background conditions. These sites, four of which
      have records exceeding 25 years in length, provide information on
     possible long-term changes in tropospheric ozone near the surface.
     Total Ozone - Column measurements of ozone are made at 15 locations
      that are part of a global network for detecting and understanding
    atmospheric ozone change. The Dobson spectrophotometer that makes the
     total column measurements is also used at six locations to measure
     ozone profiles using the umkehr technique. At several locations the
                  measurement record is 40 years in length.
      Water Vapor - Balloon-borne, chilled mirror hygrometers are flown
       monthly at Boulder, Colorado and as part of campaigns at other
    locations to obtain water vapor profiles in the upper troposphere and
     lower stratosphere (to ~28 km). The 20-year record at Boulder is a
    unique record of measurements showing changes in stratospheric water
                                   vapor.
