   The Southern Plains Range Research Station (SPRRS) has its main campus
   located in Woodward, OK. This location includes about 480 acres of
   federal, 280 acres of state, and 160 acres of county property. There
   are approximately 10 significant buildings including offices,
   laboratories, greenhouses, and maintenance buildings.

   The Southern Plains Experimental Range (SPER) is located about 15 miles
   from Woodward near the town of Fort Supply. This research ranching
   facility utilizes about 4300 acres of federal land.

   Both locations are located near the North Canadian river and have sandy
   soils derived from the river. The native plant community is primarily
   the sand sage mixed grassland which is dominated by sand sage
   (Artemisia filifolia) and several mid- and short-grasses such as sand
   bluestem (Andropogon hallii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium
   scoparium), sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), and blue grama
   (Bouteloua curtipendula). Important broadleaved plants include Western
   ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), silverleaf nightshade (Solanum
   elaeagnifolium), and camphorweed (Heterotheca subaxilaris)
