           DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REGULATORY INTERNET SITES

   To provide more information about the Department's regulatory
   activities, the Department maintains a number of internet sites. Those
   regulatory sites are listed below. The "home page" will provide general
   information about the Departmental element. The other sites are more
   specific. To access any of the actual sites, simply click on the title
   of the site in which you are interested. Note that the Surface
   Transportation Board, although administratively placed in the
   Department of Transportation, is treated as an independent agency and
   not responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of the
   Department or any of its officers, employees, or agents. We have
   included the Board's regulatory internet sites under this section for
   ease of reference.
