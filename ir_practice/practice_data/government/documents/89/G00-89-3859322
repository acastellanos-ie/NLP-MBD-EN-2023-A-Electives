   Advanced Search Keyword Search

   Advanced searches of U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) web sites are
   available through the FirstGov search engine.

   The "DOC advanced search at FirstGov" link below will initialize
   FirstGov's advanced search page to search only DOC web sites.

   To continue searching only DOC web sites after your first search at
   FirstGov, use the "REVISE SEARCH" button.

   Using the "NEW SEARCH" button after your first search will reset
   FirstGov so that subsequent searches will no longer be restricted to
   DOC web sites only.
