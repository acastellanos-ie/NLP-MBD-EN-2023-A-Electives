      The NPMS is being built and maintained using information voluntarily
      supplied by firms that operate pipeline and LNG facilities.

      Operators are asked to adhere to NPMS data standards for all
      submissions that they provide. The standards available on this site can
      be read online or downloaded using the links provided. Samples maps and
      submission check-lists are also provided.

      NPMS softwares including the NPMS Attribute and Metadata Templates,
      utilities, and application upgrades can be downloaded using the links
      provided. The NPMS Attribute and Metadata Templates are self-contained
      executables to assist in the creation and submission of attribute data
      for pipelines and LNG facilities.
