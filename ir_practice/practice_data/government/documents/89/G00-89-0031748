   Common Criteria Users Guide
   __________________________________________________

   Project Description: The Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408) is an
   international IT security standard that will be used extensively by
   Federal agencies and industry. The Common Criteria can be used in many
   different applications from specifying security requirements for IT
   products and systems to supporting system-level certification and
   accreditation processes and acquisitions. The Common Criteria, being a
   rather large and complex document, can be very intimidating for
   consumers attempting to develop protection profiles and security
   targets. A simplified tutorial-type document is needed to increase the
   basic skill level of consumers and producers of products and systems
   with respect to the fundamental concepts of the Common Criteria. The
   document must communicate the concepts in a straightforward manner to
   managers and technicians responsible for the development and
   implementation of security products used in securing the systems and
   networks of Federal agencies.

   Project Objectives: To develop a 50-75-page users guide that explains
   in basic terms, the fundamental concepts of the Common Criteria and how
   the criteria can be used to support systems engineering and systems
   security engineering principles and methods.
