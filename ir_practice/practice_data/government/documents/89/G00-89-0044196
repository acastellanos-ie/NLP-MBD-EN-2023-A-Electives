   Information Power Grid

   The NAS Division is leading the effort to build and test NASAs
   Information Power Grid (lPG), a network of high performance computers,
   data storage devices, scientific instruments, and advanced user
   interfaces.


                                  3rd Information Power Grid Workshop
                                          December 4-5, 2001

                 The Telescience Grid Portal
                 Aviation Safety Applications
                 Network Weather Services

                See the IPG Engineering and Reseach Site for more details.

   Part of a joint effort among leaders within government, academia, and
   industry, the IPG will help NASA scientists collaborate to solve
   important problems facing the world in the 21st century.For high
   performance computing professionals involved in the IPG project, NAS
   offers a separate IPG Home Page. This site, maintained by NAS IPG
   researchers, includes IPG project plans, user documentation, mailing
   list archives, and other technical material. Some of the material in
   this section is restricted
     * Find out more about the IPG and the divisions partners and funders
       in the project.
     * Get a summary of the IPGs current capabilities and the computing
       resources dedicated so far to the project.
     * See our list of IPG-related links to other organizations and
       projects.
