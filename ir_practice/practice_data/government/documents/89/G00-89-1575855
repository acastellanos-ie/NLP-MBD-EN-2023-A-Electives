                           SOHO/LASCO CME Catalog

   The Center for Solar Physics and Space Weather (CSPSW) announces the
   availability of an online catalog of CME measurements. The catalog is
   developed using the SOHO data in cooperation with the Naval Research
   Laboratory and the Solar Data Analysis Center (SDAC) at the Goddard
   Space Flight Center. The entries start From January 1996 (immediately
   after the launch of SOHO). The catalog is complete up to December 2000
   and will be current soon. There are about 3000 CMEs in the catalog.

   The catalog contains a list of all CMEs identified by LASCO operators,
   and a few additional ones identified during our measurements. In
   addition, it contains a number of measurements that characterize the
   CMEs: Date and time of first appearance in the C2 coronagraph field of
   view, central position angle, angular width (twice the cone-angle),
   speed from linear fit to the height-time measurements, speed at the
   last height of measurement using quadratic fit, speed at 20 Ro using
   quadratic fit, acceleration obtained from the quadratic fit, and the
   actual position angle at which the height-time measurements are made.
   Links are also provided to the daily mpeg movies created by the Naval
   Research Laboratory using C2 and C3 coronagraph images and the
   Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) images at 195 A. Each CME
   is identified by the date and time of occurrence. Here are some
   additional features of the catalog:

   1. By clicking on the date, one can view javascript movies of the CMEs
   within the C2 field of view, with the EIT 195 images superposed so that
   the solar source of the CME could be identified.
   2. By clicking on the time, one can view the actual height-time
   measurements.
   3. By clicking on the linear speed, one can view the height-time plot
   (in gif format); by clicking on the second order speed, one can view
   the quadratic fit.

   The catalog resides at the CSPSW's CDAW Data Center (
   http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov), supported by NASA. The catalog will undergo
   frequent updates, so please check the web site frequently. Java-script
   movies may not be available for all dates at the moment.

   We started this project initially to study the relation between
   interplanetary type II radio bursts observed by the Wind/WAVES and then
   extended to all CMEs. We hope this catalog will be useful to the
   scientific community in enhancing scientific return from US Space
   missions.

   Sample measurements were made by two post-doctoral fellows, Drs S.
   Yashiro and G. Michalek to check for consistency. The measurements were
   within 10% error. We also consulted several CME researchers in
   developing this catalog: Drs. R. Howard (NRL), O. C. St. Cyr
   (CSPSW/NRL/GSFC), S. P. Plunkett (NRL), N. Rich (NRL) and G Lawrence
   (CSPSW).

   We encourage everyone to use the catalog and send us comments and
   suggestions so we can improve and refine the catalog. We would be
   delighted to participate in collaborative projects that use the
   catalog. Please keep us informed about your projects that use the
   catalog so we can avoid conflicts.

   We suggest that users of the catalog acknowledge the catalog to the
   effect of the following:

   "This CME catalog is generated and maintained by the Center for Solar
   Physics and Space Weather, The Catholic University of America in
   cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory and NASA. SOHO is a
   project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA."

   Sincerely,

   N. Gopalswamy (gopals@fugee.gsfc.nasa.gov)
   S. Yashiro (yashiro@cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov)
   G. Michalek (michalek@cspsw2.gsfc.nasa.gov)

     JGR Special Section on Global picture of Solar Eruptive Events
   A special section in JGR space Physics is getting ready to be published
   sometime this summer. About 20 papers on solar eruptive events based on
   the international conference and the 1999 ISTP/IACG workshop will
   appear in the special section. One can purchase a single issue of
   JGR-Space Physics containing the special section for $20 (non members
   of AGU: $40). To get an idea of the contents of the special section,
   Please see the introduction to the special section. You may contact the
   AGU directly to purchase the issue.
