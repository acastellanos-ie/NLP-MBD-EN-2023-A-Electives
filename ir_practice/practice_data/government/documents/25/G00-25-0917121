                            Who We Are


   Pacific Region Map The Pacific Region, Civil Air Patrol, is comprised
   of only six wings -- Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and
   Washington -- but covers the largest geographical territory in terms of
   both travel distance between wings and area -- over a million square
   miles in the six states alone, almost twice as large as any other
   region!

   The Pacific Region is commanded by Civil Air Patrol Colonel Phillip S
   Groshong. Col Groshong most recently served as Vice Commander for the
   Pacific Region and has been in the Civil Air Patrol for over 40 years.
   A former Oregon Wing Commander, Col Groshong began his CAP career as a
   cadet in 1960. Groshong went on to pursue a career in flying, first
   with the US Air Force, and then as an airline pilot. While in the Air
   Force, he flew over 200 combat missions in F-4C Phantoms in Vietnam,
   after which he was assigned as a T-38 instructor pilot at Laughlin AFB,
   Texas. Colonel Groshong's next assignment was his most enjoyable --
   USAF Liaison Officer to the Colorado Wing, CAP. His Air Force
   decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross with two oak leaf
   clusters, the Air Medal with 12 oak leaf clusters, and the Air Force
   Commendation Medal. His CAP decorations include the Distinguished,
   Exceptional and Meritorious Service awards, The Gill Robb Wilson Award
   (CAPs highest training award), and numerous Commanders Commendations.
   Groshong is a graduate of the University of Oregon, and is currently a
   senior captain with United Air Lines flying 747-400s on international
   routes. He is married to the former Marjorie Johnson of Phoenix,
   Arizona, and has three grown children.

   Lt Col Steven A Senderling serves as Pacific Region Chief of Staff. Lt
   Col Senderling, like Colonels Groshong and Starr, is a former cadet and
   has dedicated the majority of his CAP career serving the cadet program
   in both command and staff positions. Among his many CAP assignments, he
   has served as Director of Cadet Programs for the Hawaii, Colorado and
   California Wings and served as the Deputy Chief of Staff, Cadet
   Programs for the Pacific Region. He keeps active in many areas of the
   three-fold CAP mission, and is a current check pilot for the region. Lt
   Col Senderling is a full-time flight instructor at Lane Community
   College in Eugene, Oregon, where he and his wife, Claire, make their
   home.
