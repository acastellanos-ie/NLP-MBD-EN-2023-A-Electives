    BERA BADMINTON CLUB

   [badminton1-1.gif] Welcome to Badminton Club at Brookhaven National
   Lab(BNL), Upton, Long Island, New York. This club opens to BNL
   employees and guests only. Players can compete in either a
   challenge-format singles ladder or a season-long doubles tournament.
   The 1996-97 Ladder play will begin Monday, 30 September 1996, and end
   Friday, 5 April 1997. Updated club rosters have been placed on the
   badminton bulletin board in the gym. Please take one so you have
   up-to-date phone numbers. Format and court sign-up is same as last
   year, so I won't bother sending out an announcement. If you want more
   information, call myself or Yi Zhao, or refer to the 95-96 club rules
   until we get them updated. Ladder standings will be updated weekly,
   both here and on the gym bulletin board.

   Yi Zhao will be the new V.P. of the club and James Safranek treasurer.
   Yi has done a great job setting up and managing our web page, so any
   additions or corrections, please forward his way. We will not try to
   collect dues this year due to unpopularity of the idea last year. If
   there is sufficient interest, however, this does not mean that we can't
   think about having a party or tournament sometime during the year, so
   let us know. And finally, yes, I do have birds. They are yellow and
   cost $7.50/half dozen. I'm in Bldg. 830, Room 7M.

   One schedule note to keep in mind if you are in the process of
   arranging a weekly singles or doubles match: soccer players take over
   the gym at noon on Tuesdays. Hence, the 12:00 and 1:00 time slots will
   be unavailable on Tuesdays come bad weather.

   -- Jay Adams, President

Club Rules Rules

     The general USBA rules for tournament play should be followed. They
     are posted on the badminton bulletin board at the northwest entrance
     to the gym.

Singles Ladder

     Each singles match is scheduled as the result of a challenge. Any
     player may challenge another on the same level of the ladder or on
     the next level above. The weekly standings posted on Monday will
     determine the legitimacy of challenges made that week, whatever the
     standings may be when the match is actually played. If an entrant
     has not already accepted a challenge during a given week he must
     accept the challenge or forfeit the match. No player is required to
     accept more than one challenge per week. Any singles player except
     the player in position 1 will recede one position on the ladder when
     he fails to compete for two successive weeks. A victorious
     challenger will take the position of the defeated player who will
     drop back one position. It is the winner's responsibility to record
     the results of the match and the date on the pad provided.

   Doubles Tournament

     A match will consist of three games played by any four registered
     doubles players in a round-robin fashion, each player playing one
     game as the partner of each of the other players. In order for the
     match to count it must be recorded, with the date, on the forms
     provided. Scoring is based on the difference between the totals of
     games lost and games won by each player. If losses to date exceed
     wins, the player gets one point for each game played. If wins exceed
     losses, the player gets a bonus of two times the excess of wins over
     losses. This scheme is intended to encourage participation while
     allowing a winning player to advance at a reasonable level of
     activity.

   Court Use

     Two courts are available in the west side of the gym between 11 and
     2 weekdays, and Saturday mornings between 9 and 12. Courts may be
     reserved on the calendar in the gym no more than one week in
     advance. Please limit sign-up to one noon hour and no more than two
     week-day hours per player per week. Doubles play should have
     priority for the noon hour. Saturday matches must be scheduled in
     advance to avoid interference with other activities in the gym.
