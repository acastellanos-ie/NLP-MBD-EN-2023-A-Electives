   The Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS) database is a repository of
   Make and Model information. The TCDS is a formal description of the
   aircraft, engine or propeller. It lists limitations and information
   required for type certification including airspeed limits, weight
   limits, thrust limitations, etc.
   TCDS documents are available from the initial implementation of this
   database (April 1999) forward. Historical documents prior to
   implementation are not necessarily included in this database; however,
   historical information will be retained as additional documents and
   revisions to documents are incorporated into the database.
   Revision History refers to those documents that have been revised
   through a TCDS revision. Current documents refer to those that are the
   most current. When looking at the TCDS and Model information in any of
   the Revision History views, the checkmark indicates the current
   documents.
