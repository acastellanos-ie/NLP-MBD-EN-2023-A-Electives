                             What is CDC WONDER?

     CDC WONDER is an easy-to-use system that provides a single point of
     access to a wide variety of CDC reports, guidelines, and numeric
     public health data.

     If you arrived here by following a link to a specific document or
     data set, you may simply click on the Anonymous User button to
     continue on to your target.

     CDC WONDER furthers CDC's mission of health promotion and disease
     prevention by speeding and simplifying access to public health
     information for state and local health departments, the Public
     Health Service, the academic public health community, and the public
     at large. CDC WONDER can be valuable in public health research,
     decision making, priority setting, program evaluation, and resource
     allocation.

     With CDC WONDER you can:
     * Search for and retrieve MMWR articles and Prevention Guidelines
       published by CDC;
     * Query dozens of numeric data sets on CDC's mainframe and other
       computers, via "fill-in-the blank" request screens. Public-use data
       sets about mortality, cancer incidence, hospital discharges, AIDS,
       behavioral risk factors, diabetes, and many other topics are
       available for query, and the requested data can be readily
       summarized and analyzed.
     * Locate the name and e-mail addresses of CDC staff and registered
       CDC WONDER users;
     * Post notices, general announcements, data files, or software
       programs of interest to public health professionals in an
       electronic forum, for perusal by CDC staff and other CDC WONDER
       users;

                             New CDC WONDER logon

     This is a new version of CDC WONDER, released October 21, 1998.

     When you first access any part of the WONDER system, you will see
     this logon screen. You do not have to log on. You may use the system
     anonymously, or you may log on with a user ID and password. If you
     choose to be anonymous, the system does not ask you for any personal
     information, and there is no user ID or password to remember. If you
     have a WONDER user ID and password, you are encouraged to log on;
     there are advantages to logging on with your user ID.

     You may occasionally receive a "timeout" message from CDC WONDER.
     This simply means that 15 minutes of inactivity have gone by and CDC
     WONDER has terminated your session. You can easily begin a new
     session by logging on (or choosing anonymity) again.

                               Return to logon
       _______________________________________________________________

                         Anonymous users please note
     Your WONDER session may time out after several minutes of inactivity
     (as may happen if you temporarily stop using your browser). If this
      happens, you will see this logon screen again, and you can always
     begin a new anonymous session. However, if you have unfinished work
     pending when your session times out, you may find yourself unable to
                    complete your work in the new session.

     You can avoid this by (1) making sure that your session does not
     time out while work is incomplete, or (2) becoming a registered user
     and logging on.

                   Advantages to registering and logging on

     We recommend registering and obtaining a user ID for access to
     certain features, and for more convenient use of the system. Logging
     on with a user ID allows you to:
     * save work from one session to the next;
     * be listed in the CDC WONDER Address Book for e-mail addresses;
     * have the system know where to send you e-mail.

            How to register for a CDC WONDER user ID and password
     If you use CDC WONDER frequently or heavily, you will probably find
       it more convenient to register; there are several advantages to
     logging on with your own user ID. Registration and use of the system
              are free. To register for your CDC WONDER user ID:
     * enter the system anonymously for now, by clicking on the Anonymous
       User button;
     * from either the WONDER home page or the Utilities page, click on
       Register to become a CDC WONDER user;
     * follow the instructions and fill out the registration form.

            Your user ID and password will be created on the spot.

       _______________________________________________________________

                       If you do not know your password

     Situations arise in which users know their user ID but do not know
     their password:
     * Users commonly forget their passwords;
     * CDC users using the system for the first time do not know their
       WONDER password;
     * Many registered users of CDC WONDER never changed their passwords
       from the default value assigned to them long ago by previous
       versions of the system. These unchanged passwords have been
       inactivated by the system because they are not secure.

     You can reestablish your password here be entering your userid and
     clicking the Retrieve Password button. If you can confirm that your
     e-mail address is accurate in our records, we will instantly
     generate a new password and e-mail it to your address. You can log
     on to WONDER as soon as you receive it, and then if you desire,
     change your password to something you can remember. Privacy can be
     assured as long as you are the only person who can retrieve your
     e-mail.
