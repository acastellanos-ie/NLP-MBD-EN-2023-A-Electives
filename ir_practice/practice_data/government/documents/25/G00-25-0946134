   Large Scale Information Integration

      Wish it were simpler to collect, integrate, manage and understand
   information from different sources and collaborate with others?

   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is developing and integrating
   state-of-the-art tools and technologies to bring teams together and to
   support areas of scientific research that are becoming increasingly
   important-modeling, simulation, visualization and collaboration. With
   our technologies you can
     * integrate scientific processes, data and resources into a common
       working environment
     * effectively organize and exploit complex and massive collections of
       data
     * integrate all stages of scientific research
     * easily collaborate and work with others
     * efficiently execute computational models over a distributed
       network.
