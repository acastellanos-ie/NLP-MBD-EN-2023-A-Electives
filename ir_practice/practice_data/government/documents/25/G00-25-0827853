   Affirmative Employment requires managers, supervisors and personnelists
   to take additional efforts to recruit, employ and promote qualified
   minorities, women and disabled individuals wh have been excluded from
   receiving these benefits due to past an present employment practices.

   Affirmative Employment Plans are required by Section 717 of the Equal
   Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Section 501 of the Rehabilitation
   Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of
   1974. These documents state strategies and goals for recruiting, hiring
   and advancing minorities women and the disabled.

   Civilian Labor Force represents the number of persons sixteen years of
   age or older employed or seeking employment. Civilian labor force
   statistics are developed by the Bureau of the Census U.S. Department of
   Commerce.

   Complainant is an individual who has filed a formal, written complaint
   of employment discrimination.

   Discrimination means making differences and distinctions among people,
   ideas, places and things. Treating people differently with respect to
   employment because of their race, color, sex, national origin, age,
   religion, or disability is considered illegal discrimination.

   Disparate Impact is an employment policy or practice, while neutral on
   its face, adversely impacts against a particular racial, ethnic or sex
   group. A neutral policy or practice ma have an adverse effect on
   disabled individuals or religious groups.

   Disparate Treatment occurs when people are treated differently , with
   respect to the terms and conditions of employment because o their race,
   color, sex, national origin, religion, age or mental or physical
   disability.

   Diverse Work Force was first used as a phrase in the Civil Service
   Reform Act of 1978. This means that the Federal government should make
   a conscientious effort to hire and retain individuals with varying
   racial and ethnic backgrounds which ect our nation's diversity.

   Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) embodies the principle of fai
   treatment in Federal employment and personnel matters without regard to
   race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age or hysical or mental
   disability.

   Equal Employment opportunity Commission (EEOC) provides guidance on
   affirmative employment program planning and discrimination complaint
   processing to Federal agencies.

   EEO Groups are defined under the regulations as White males, White
   females, Black males, Black females, Hispanic males, Hispanic females,
   Asian American/Pacific Islander males, Asian American/Pacific Islander
   females, American Indian/Alaskan Native males, and American
   Indian/Alaskan Native females. Disabled males and disabled females are
   also considered EEO groups.

   Facility Accessibility under Federal law requires buildings owned and
   leased by the Federal government to be accessible and usable by
   disabled individuals. This includes entrances into buildings,
   elevators, restrooms, water fountains, cafeterias, conference rooms and
   office equipment.

   Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP) Plan states
   objectives and strategies for the recruitment of minorities and women.
   It is aimed at eliminating under-representation of minorities and women
   in the Federal work force.

   Final Agency Decision is a document issued by the U.S. Department of
   Commerce which makes the agency's final determination on a complaint of
   discrimination.

   Major Occupations are mission-oriented occupations or those occupations
   with 100 or more employees. Major occupations at NOAA include
   Cartographer, Fishery Biologist, Meteorologist, Computer Specialist and
   Oceanographer.

   Numerical Objectives are quantifiable goals designed to eliminate a
   manifest imbalance or conspicuous absence of women and minority groups.
   These are not the same as mandatory quotas.

   Occupational Categories are major employment categories for whit collar
   and wage board pay systems. Specifically, these include professional,
   administrative, technical, clerical, other, and blue collar
   occupational categories (often referred to by the acron PATCOB).

   Proposed Disposition is a document issued by the NOAA EEO Office when a
   formal discrimination complaint is not resolved after an investigation
   has occurred. This document proposes a finding of discrimination or no
   discrimination based on the merits of the complaint.

   Reasonable Accommodation is a change made by management to the terms
   and conditions of an individual's employment. Such changes are usually
   required to accommodate an employee's or applicant's known disability
   or religious beliefs, unless this would create an undue hardship on the
   agency .

   Sexual Harassment constitutes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
   sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature
   when:
     * submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
       a term or condition of an individual's employment;
     * submission to or rejection of such conduct by a individual is used
       as the basis for employment decisions affecting such an individual;
       or
     * such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
       with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
       hostile, or offensive work environment.

   Under-representation exists when the percentage of employees in the
   Federal work force for a given occupational category or grade level is
   less than the corresponding percentage representation in the civilian
   labor force. Also refer to the terms "manifest imbalance" and
   "conspicuous absence."
