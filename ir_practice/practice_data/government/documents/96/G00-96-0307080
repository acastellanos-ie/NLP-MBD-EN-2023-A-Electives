   JESS the Rule Engine for the Java Platform

   New! Jess 6.0 final has been released!

   Jess is a rule engine and scripting environment written entirely in
   Sun's Java language by Ernest Friedman-Hill at Sandia National
   Laboratories in Livermore, CA. Jess was originally inspired by the
   CLIPS expert system shell, but has grown into a complete, distinct
   Java-influenced environment of its own. Using Jess, you can build Java
   applets and applications that have the capacity to "reason" using
   knowledge you supply in the form of declarative rules. Jess is
   surprisingly fast, and for some problems is faster than CLIPS itself
   (using a good JIT compiler, of course.)

   The core Jess language is still compatible with CLIPS, in that many
   Jess scripts are valid CLIPS scripts and vice-versa. Like CLIPS, Jess
   uses the Rete algorithm to process rules, a very efficient mechanism
   for solving the difficult many-to-many matching problem (see for
   example "Rete: A Fast Algorithm for the Many Pattern/ Many Object
   Pattern Match Problem", Charles L. Forgy, Artificial Intelligence
   19(1982), 17-37.) Jess adds many features to CLIPS, including backwards
   chaining and the ability to manipulate and directly reason about Java
   objects. Jess is also a powerful Java scripting environment, from which
   you can create Java objects and call Java methods without compiling any
   Java code.
