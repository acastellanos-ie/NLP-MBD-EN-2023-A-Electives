   Quick Tips and Examples
   It's easy to search with Infoseek. Just type in a few words or phrases.
   Try to use discriminating terms that are likely to be found only in the
   documents you seek. The more words you give, the better results you'll
   get. Here are some examples:

   Search by typing words and phrases.

     Pentium computer with 8x CD-ROM for sale

   Infoseek will find documents containing as many of these words and
   phrases as possible, ranked so that the documents most relevant to your
   query are presented first. Don't worry about missing a document because
   it doesn't have one of the words in your search -- Infoseek returns
   relevant results even if they don't contain all query terms.

   Identify phrases with quotation marks, separate with commas.

     Pentium computer with "8x CD-ROM", "for sale"

   A phrase is entered using double quotation marks, and only matches
   those words which appear adjacent to each other. Separate multiple
   phrases or proper names with a comma.

   Use UPPER case to indicate exact match.

     Steve Jobs, NeXT

   Infoseek automatically treats adjacent capitalized words as a single
   phrase. Search terms in lowercase will match words in any case,
   otherwise, an exact case match is used. For example, next will find
   matches for Next, next, and NeXT, whereas a query for NeXT will only
   match NeXT.
