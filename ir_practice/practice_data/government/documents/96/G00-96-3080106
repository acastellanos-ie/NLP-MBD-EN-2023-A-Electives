   As the statistical agency of the Department of Transportation, the
   Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) is charged with fulfilling a
   wide variety of user needs. This diversity of BTS activities and
   customers requires an inclusive and comprehensive approach to measuring
   customer service and monitoring and incorporating customer feedback.

   The objective of the BTS Customer Satisfaction Program is to measure
   the quality, comparability, utility, timeliness, relevance, and
   completeness of BTS products and to better understand customer needs,
   preferences, and experiences. The program must also enable BTS to
   monitor and adjust program and agency objectives and content
   accordingly.

   The current BTS Customer Satisfaction Program comprises both
   qualitative and quantitative methods for obtaining information from our
   customers:
     * informal customer feedback in the form of phone calls, e-mails,
       casual conversations, and comment cards;
     * focus groups that include current and past clients of BTS; and
     * a recent Customer Satisfaction Survey mailout.

   If you have questions or concerns about BTS products or services,
   please contact us at 800-853-1351 or
