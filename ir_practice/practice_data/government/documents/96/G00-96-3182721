   Federal Aviation Administration Section 508

                       THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION
                           Washington, D.C. 20590
                                June 14, 2001
               Access to Electronic and Information Technology
                              Policy Statement

      It is the policy of the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide
   access to all of its programs, services and information to people with
   disabilities that is comparable to the level of access provided to
   others. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and related Departmental
   regulations, have made this a requirement since 1978. With the passage
   of recent amendments to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, we must
   also ensure that the Department's electronic and information technology
   (EIT) meets specific accessibility standards for people with
   disabilities, including both employees and the customers we serve,
   whenever we develop, procure, maintain or use EIT.
      Section 508 requires us to provide accessible EIT to the
   Department's employees with disabilities, to enable them to
   successfully do their jobs and enjoy the same benefits of training and
   career opportunities that are available to others in the workforce.
   Also, Section 508 requires us to provide our customers with
   disabilities accessible EIT to enable them to enjoy the same benefits
   of the Department's programs, services and information that are
   available to others.
      To guide us, the U.S. Access Board established new EIT accessibility
   standards, the General Services Administration issued new EIT
   acquisition requirements and the Department of Justice (Justice)
   provided compliance coordination. To implement Section 508, beginning
   June 21, 2001, the Department must acquire EIT products that meet the
   new standards and acquisition requirements. In addition, we will strive
   to develop, maintain, and use EIT that meets the new standards, unless
   doing so would result in an undue burden. The Department will also
   cooperate with Justice by providing data about EIT accessibility and
   other issues.
      I am asking all employees to make a strong commitment to providing
   the Department's programs, services and information, including its EIT,
   in a format that is accessible to people with disabilities. Also, I am
   calling on all managers and supervisors to provide the leadership
   necessary to accomplish these important goals. To help ensure that the
   Department implements this policy and related requirements, I am
   directing the Chief Information Officer and the Director of the
   Departmental Office of Civil Rights to provide policy guidance and
   technical assistance to the Operating Administrations and Secretarial
   Officers. Additionally, I expressly delegate to all Administrators the
   responsibility to conduct compliance procedures, including the
   processing of complaints and appeals, covered by 49 C.F.R. Part 28.
