   IGS Organization Information

      A diagram showing the organization of the IGS is illustrated here. The
      GPS stations shown below the GPS satellites are permanent and operate
      continuously, receiving and recording the L-band and dual-frequency
      signals transmitted by the GPS satellites. The station data of the IGS
      network is accessed by Operational Data Centers (ODCs) through various
      communication schemes, such as the Internet, telephone, INMARSAT, radio
      modem, and V-SAT. The Operational Data Centers are responsible for the
      direct interface to the GPS receiver, connecting to the remote site
      daily and downloading and archiving the raw receiver data. The quality
      of these data are validated by checking the number of observations,
      number of observed satellites, date and time of the first and last
      record in the file. The data are then translated from raw receiver
      format to a common format called Receiver Independent Exchange (RINEX)
      and compressed. Both the observation and navigation files (and ideally
      meteorological data) are then transmitted to the Regional or Global
      Data Centers .

        Regional Data Centers

        Regional Data Centers (RDCs) gather data from various operational
        data centers and maintain an archive for users interested in
        stations of a particular region. To reduce electronic network
        traffic, the Regional Data Centers are used to collect data from
        several Operational Data Centers before transmitting them to the
        Global Data Centers. Data not used for global analyses are archived
        and available for online access at the Regional Data Centers.

        Global Data Centers

        Global Data Centers (GDCs) are ideally the principle GPS data source
        for the IGS Analysis Centers and the general user community. GDCs
        are tasked to provide an on-line archive of at least 100 days of GPS
        data in the common data format, including, at a minimum, the data
        from all global IGS sites. The GDCs are also required to provide an
        on-line archive of derived products, generated by the IGS analysis
        centers and associate analysis centers; two of the three global data
        centers currently provide on-line access to IGS products generated
        since the start of the IGS test campaign (June 1992). These data
        centers equalize holdings of global sites and derived products on a
        daily basis (at minimum). The three GDCs provide the IGS with a
        level of redundancy, thus preventing a single point of failure
        should a data center become unavailable. Users can continue to
        reliably access data on a daily basis from one of the other two data
        centers. Furthermore, three centers reduce the network traffic that
        could occur to a single geographical location.

      More detail concerning the IGS data flow can be found in the IGS Annual
      Reports, in the section on Data Centers. The IGS Analysis Centers
      retrieve the data sets from the Global Data Centers and produce GPS
      ephemerides, station coordinates, earth rotation parameters, etc. These
      products are then sent to the Analysis Center Coordinator who uses an
      orbit combination technique to produce the official IGS orbits (the
      rapid orbit available on a daily basis and the final orbit, available
      with a delay of approximately 8 to 10 days and based on weekly fits).
      The products generated are sent back to the Global Data Centers and the
      Central Bureau Information System (CBIS) for archiving and user access.
      The Central Bureau is responsible for the overall coordination and
      management of the service. The International Governing Board (GB) is
      the body that oversees the activities and direction of the IGS. The
      success of the IGS is due to the voluntary and active participation of
      Associate Members and Contributing Organizations.

      The 1994 IGS Annual Report, available from the Central Bureau,
      describes the fundamental organization of the IGS in greater detail, as
      well as the evolution of the GPS tracking network that comprises in the
      current IGS network.

   Associate Analysis Centers -- Pilot Project for the Densification of the ITRF

      The Associate Analysis Centers produce unique products within the IGS.
      In September of 1995, the highly successful Pilot Project for the
      Densification of the ITRF reference frame, using the IGS network,
      officially began. The project was designed as conceptual proof of the
      distributed processing of GPS data from many stations, and relies on
      the Global Network Associate Analysis Centers (GNAACs) for a
      combination of results submitted by IGS Analysis Centers and the
      Regional Network Associate Analysis Centers (RNAACs). This combination
      of solutions produces precise station locations and velocities in a
      consistent reference frame. The Call for Participation at the Regional
      Level was announced in January 1996. It is interesting to note that
      EUREF, the Subcommission for Europe within the IAG Commission X on
      Global and Regional Geodetic Networks, is an RNAAC which combines a
      number of solutions from various RNAACs within Europe and passes this
      regionally-combined solution on to the GNAACs. Additional detailed
      information can also be found in the IGS Reports series on the CBIS.

      Other types of Associate Analysis Centers that support the use of GPS
      data and products in other research areas (such Ionospheric and
      atmospheric applications) are being considered.
