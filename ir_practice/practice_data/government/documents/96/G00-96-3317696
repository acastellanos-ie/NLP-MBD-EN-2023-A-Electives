   The Competition

General Description and Prizes

   Lunar Landscapes The 2002 competition will be held April 12-13 on the
   grounds of the U.S. Space & Rocket Center. Students are required to
   design a vehicle that addresses a series of engineering problems that
   are similar to problems faced by the original Moonbuggy team.

   Each Moonbuggy will be human powered and carry two students, one female
   and one male, over a half-mile simulated lunar terrain course including
   "craters," rocks, "lava" ridges, inclines and "lunar" soil.

   Moonbuggy entries are expected to be of "proof-of-concept" and
   engineering test model nature, rather than final production models. As
   a part of the competition, and prior to course testing, the
   un-assembled Moonbuggy entries must be carried to the course starting
   line, with the unassembled components contained in a volume of 4x 4x 4
   (dimension requirements similar to those for the original Lunar Roving
   Vehicle). At the starting line, the entries will be assembled and
   readied for course testing and evaluated for safety.

   The top three winning teams in each division (one high school division
   and one college division) will be those having the shortest total times
   in assembling their moonbuggies and traversing the terrain course. Each
   team is permitted two runs of the terrain course.

Prizes

   Prizes will be awarded to the top three winning teams in both the High
   School Division and College Division. Awards will be for the six
   registered team members and their faculty/instructor advisor.

   A prize will also be awarded to the team whose Moonbuggy design
   represents the best technical approach toward solving the engineering
   problem of navigating the lunar surface. The award is based, not on
   Moonbuggy race performance, but upon the technical approach taken by
   teams in their design. The design competition is optional. Click here
