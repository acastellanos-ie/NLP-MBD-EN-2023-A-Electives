                 Washington State Legislature Meeting Schedules

     Visit the Calendars page.

   The Legislative Meeting Schedule Listserv allows you to receive the
   Legislative Weekly and Daily Meeting Schedules via e-mail. The Meeting
   Schedules display the dates and times for committee and floor sessions
   and include agendas for House and Senate standing committees. Each
   agenda indicates the bills to be heard, the dates, times, and locations
   of the meetings. The Daily Schedule displays asterisks next to
   revisions to an existing agenda.
