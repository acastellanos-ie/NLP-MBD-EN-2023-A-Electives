                                             Picture of cloud radar data.
     The ARM Program's award-winning Millimeter Wave Cloud Radar (MMCR) is
      an active sensor that can measure cloud boundaries and microphysical
    properties with high space and time resolution. This data sample shows
       a thunderstorm passing above the Central Facility at ARM's Southern
                                                        Great Plains site.

   The ARM Program's primary objective is to test and improve General
   Circulation Model (GCM) parameterizations of clouds and their effect on
   the radiative energy balance. To meet this goal, data are being
   gathered to measure key aspects of the radiation field under a range of
   climatologically significant conditions.

Range of Measurements


   Diagram depicting the different types of measurements gathered by ARM.
      This diagram attempts to present the different types of measurements
     that the ARM Program gathers. The gathering methods (e.g., land-based
                instruments, ships, and satellites) are also represented.

   The ARM Program is gathering a wide variety of measurements from many
   different sources (see diagram to the right). The ARM Archive stores
   and distributes large quantities of data each day that are collected
   from these sources. Scientists then use these data to research
   atmospheric radiation balance and cloud feedback processes, which are
   critical to the understanding of global climate change.

General Measurement Strategies

   The ARM Program has two primary strategies in pursuing its goal to
   provide better parameterizations of clouds and radiation in climate
   models: the Instantaneous Radiative Flux (IRF) strategy and the
   Single-Column Modeling (SCM) strategy. The approach and manner in which
   ARM gathers data are affected by these two strategies. More about the
   two primary strategies...

Scientific Focus Areas

   The ARM Program is focusing its data collection and research activities
   into six focus areas: 1) aerosols, 2) clouds, 3) longwave radiation, 4)
   shortwave radiation, 5) surface energy exchange (or flux), and 6)
   atmospheric state. To facilitate their research efforts, ARM scientists
   have organized in working groups that reflect the special focus areas
   outlined above. These focus areas will change over time as research
   goals are narrowed and new observational programs are developed. More
   on Arm's focus areas and measurements.

Data Collection Sites


                            Diagram showing types and amounts of ARM data
   This diagram attempts to demonstrate the types and amounts of data that
                              ARM has collected in its Archive since 1993.

   The ARM Program operates field research sites, called Cloud and
   Radiation Testbeds (CARTs), in three climatically significant locales
   worldwide: Southern Great Plains, Tropical Western Pacific, and North
   Slope of Alaska. Scientists use the Carts to collect and analyze data
   essential to understanding the effects and interactions of sunlight,
   radiant energy, and clouds on temperatures, weather, and climate.

Instrumentation

   The ARM Program's primary observational method is through remote
   sensing and other observations at the surface. Regular and specially
   designed instruments are in place at the three ARM sites and are
   providing data on a routine basis. It is impossible to meet Arm's
   objectives, however, without obtaining a large volume of detailed
   in-situ measurements, some of which are gathered from manned or
   unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs).

Intensive Operational Periods

   Frequently, an ARM site will hold an intensive operational period
   (IOP). The data from these visiting instruments are sent to the Archive
   for permanent storage.

Visiting Instruments

   Frequently, scientists will bring their own instruments to an ARM site
   for the purpose of calibrating and/or testing the instrument or running
   comparisons during a specific intensive operational period (IOP). The
   data from these visiting instruments often are sent to the Archive for
   permanent storage.

Aircraft

   Scientists will often use aircraft to gather airborne data during
   intensive operational periods (IOPs) at an ARM site. In addition, the
   Unmanned Aerospace Vehicle Program is a remotely piloted, high-altitude
   and long-endurance platform for making important climate measurements
   on evolving cloud fields and their effect on the solar and thermal
   radiation balance in the atmosphere. The ARM External Data Center
   gathers these kinds of external data sets and sends them to the ARM
   Archive. Listing of Aircraft Data...

Forecast Models

   The ARM External Data Center regularly collects analysis and forecast
   model products produced by the National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP) and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasting (ECMWF). These products are used to augment the instrument
   data collected at the ARM sites. We have models that are specific to
   each site (SGP, TWP, and NSA).

Satellites

   High-quality satellite observations are needed to measure the
   top-of-the-atmosphere radiation. These data augment the data being
   generated within the program and are usually converted from native
   format to either netCDF or HDF formats. Again, the External Data Center
   gathers these kinds of external data sets and sends them to the ARM
   Archive. Note that the types of satellite data are different at each
   site (SGP, TWP, and NSA).

Value-Added Processing

   Many of the scientific needs of the ARM project are met through
   Value-added Procedures (VAPs). A VAP creates a "second generation" data
   stream by using existing ARM data streams as inputs and applying
   algorithms or models to them. A VAP is run continuously in the ARM Data
   Management Facility and the output generated is treated as a new ARM
   data stream.

Data Documentation

   There are many documents that help data users to understand ARM data
   (e.g., data stream descriptions) or that supplement the data (e.g.,
   data quality reports, metadata). This diagram is a pictorial
   representation of the types of information ARM gathers about the data.
   Additional details about data files and data stream descriptions are
   provided below.

Data Files and Data Stream Descriptions

   This section describes ARM data files and details the types of data
   streams contained in the data files.

   Data File

   The ARM measurements are aggregated together in data files. A data file
   usually contains a time series of one or more measurements for a known
   time interval and a single location. Most data are stored in netCDF
   format. This format allows for the definition of data fields and
   storage of operational information in the header of the file .PC
   Microsoft users note cdf files are not Channel Definition Format files
   (which the Microsoft CDF Generator program uses) but rather netcdf
   files (network common data form). There are a lot of netcdf libraries
   out there to let you use netcdf files (FORTRAN, C, IDL, etc.). Here are
   a few others: http://playground.arm.gov/~flynn/pub/arm_ware/ncdx/html/
   http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/
   More information on the netCDF format and tools is available from UCAR
   at http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html.

   Some data files also contain one or more measurements distributed over
   a region from a single time (e.g., satellite images). These data are
   stored in the HDF format developed by National Center for
   Supercomputing Applications (see http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/ for more
   information on HDF).

   A single data file is the smallest unit of information distributed by
   ARM to its data users. Persons needing less than the contents of a
   single data file must derive the subset with their own tools. At this
   time, the ARM program has generated 100,000s of data files.

   Data Stream
   Collections of data files that have a common source and structure are
   called data streams. A data stream represents the output of a single
   data source (i.e., instrument, instrument group, or algorithm). All
   files within a single data stream have a common information content
   (e.g., same measurement types and operational information, and similar
   name). At this time, the ARM Program has generated more than 800 data
   streams.

   Example of Data Stream:



sgp15ebbrE12.a1

-**-*-***-** -*

|  | |   |   `---->data level - the level of data processing

|  | |   `-------->facility name (e.g., extended facility E12)

|  | `------------>abbreviation for instrument name

|  `-------------->## - time integration instrument parameter

`----------------->site (e.g., sgp - Southern Great Plains)


   Data stream groups
   Data streams can be categorized into more than one grouping scheme
   (e.g., by location, source, or processing status). Understanding
   relationships between data streams can simplify the overwhelming
   magnitude of ARM data. All of the data streams within a group may share
   common attributes. For example, all data streams from similar sources
   (instruments or algorithms) will have similar (often identical) data
   fields containing measurements. Data streams from similar sources will
   also reference common instrument descriptions.

Data Level Documentation

   ARM data are classified into several data levels. The levels represent
   the amount of processing the data have gone through.


                                 Data Level*
                              Processing Status
                              00 data Raw data
               a0 data Data that have been converted to netCDF
    a1 data Data that meet a0 requirements, are expressed in engineering
                  units, and have had calibrations applied
       a2, a3, a4, . . ., a9 a1 data that have been further processed
       b1 Data that meet a1 requirements and have had quality control
                       (min/max/delta) checks applied
   b2, b3, b4, . . ., b9 b1 data that have had additional quality control
                               checks applied
                          c1 Derived data products
       c2, c3, c4, . . ., c9 c1 data that have been further processed
   *Note: some data have not been processed through all phases (e.g., data
         level goes from being level 00, then a0, a1, and then c1).

   The amount of processing to which data have been subjected can be
   determined by the data level extension of the data stream name. Raw
   data, collected directly from the instrument or external source, are
   designated with a .00 extension. Data designated as a0 have minimally
   undergone a format change from the raw (binary, ascii, other) format to
   netcdf. If the data are also expressed in engineering units and
   calibration factors have been applied (as needed), the data are
   assigned an a1 data stream name extension. Data that have been further
   processed but do not meet the minimal requirements of b1 level data are
   assigned data levels of a2, a3, etc. The latter are considered
   intermediate products and are not usually intended for use by the
   scientific community.

   To be designated as b1 data, the data must meet the minimal
   requirements of a1 level data plus have had basic quality measures
   applied. These QC measures usually take the form of
   minimum/maximum/delta checks. If further processing is conducted on b1
   data, the data are assigned data levels of. b2, b3, etc.

   Data designated by a c1 extension are derived data. These data are the
   output of an algorithm applied to ARM and/or external data to calculate
   values that might not be directly measurable. These algorithms are
   called Value-added Procedures and the output called a Value-added
   Product.

   Data Management and Documentation Plan

   The Data Management and Documentation Plan provides an overview of the
   ARM Program's philosophy on managing and documenting data.

Data Sharing and Distribution Policy

   The ARM Data Sharing and Distribution Policy describes the Program's
   policy on sharing and distributing ARM data.

Data Gathering and Delivery

   The ARM instruments automatically collect data on surface and
   atmospheric properties, and the information is sent to the site data
   systems. Data are packaged into daily files and distributed through the
   ARM data systems. The files are generally available from the ARM
   Archive within 48 hours. Two of the ARM data systems (Southern Great
   Plains and North Slope of Alaska sites) are linked by high speed
   communications to the Data Archive at the Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory. Data gathered by the Atmospheric Radiation Cloud Stations
   at the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) site are sent by tape to the Data
   Management Facility via the mail system. In addition, the External Data
   Center, located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, acquires additional
   data from other sources, such as National Weather Service satellite and
   surface data. Most of the ARM data are distributed in netCDF format.
