       OWS> UI > Extended Benefits

   Extended Benefits
   Purpose
   Extended Benefits are available to workers who have exhausted regular
   unemployment insurance benefits during periods of high unemployment.
   The basic Extended Benefits program provides up to 13 additional weeks
   of benefits when a State is experiencing high unemployment. Some States
   have also enacted a voluntary program to pay up to 7 additional weeks
   (20 weeks maximum) of Extended Benefits during periods of extremely
   high unemployment.
   Eligibility
   Extended Benefits may start after an individual exhausts other
   unemployment insurance benefits (not including Disaster Unemployment
   Assistance or Trade Readjustment Allowances).
   Not everyone who qualified for regular benefits qualifies for Extended
   Benefits. The State agency will advise you of your eligibility for
   Extended Benefits.
   Benefits
   The weekly benefit amount of Extended Benefits is the same as the
   individual received for regular unemployment compensation.
   The total amount of Extended Benefits that an individual could receive
   may be fewer than 13 weeks (or fewer than 20 weeks).
   Filing A Claim
   When a State begins an Extended Benefit period, it notifies those who
   have received all of their regular benefits that they may be eligible
   for Extended Benefits. If your State's unemployment is high, you should
   contact the State Unemployment Insurance agency to ask whether Extended
   Benefits are available.
