   The International Aviation Training Symposium (IATS), hosted by the FAA
   Academy, will be held in Oklahoma City, at the Westin Hotel, September
   28-30, 1999.  Up to 300 delegates having aviation training oversight,
   as well as direct training responsibilities and interests from around
   the world, are expected to attend.

 The theme of the symposium is "Aviation Training for the 21st Century."  The
IATS will promote safety through training; allow delegates to participate in
workshops in revising and administering training; focus on training and
training development initiatives; and promote the "Safe-Skies" initiatives.
