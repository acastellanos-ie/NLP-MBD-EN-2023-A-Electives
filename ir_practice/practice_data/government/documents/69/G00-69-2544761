   Our Nation's Veterans
   Of the 25 million veterans currently alive, nearly three of every four
   served during a war or an official period of hostility. About a quarter
   of the nation's population -- approximately 70 million people -- are
   potentially eligible for VA benefits and services because they are
   veterans, family members or survivors of veterans.
