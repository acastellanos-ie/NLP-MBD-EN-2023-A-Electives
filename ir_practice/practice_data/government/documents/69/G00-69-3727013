                       Welcome to the Systems Division

       The Systems Division provides IT support for the Central
   Administrative Support Center (CASC). We design, implement, and
   maintain the technology that employees of the other CASC divisions use
   to perform their services for our NOAA customers.

       The DivisionÂ’s mission, and philosophy, is to ensure the highest
   level of functionality and availability of CASC IT systems possible,
   enabling CASC users to provide our clients with "world class" service
   at all times.
