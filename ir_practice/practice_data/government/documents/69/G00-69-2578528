                              Postdoc Positions

      We are seeking Postdoctoral Fellows in the discipline of Applied
     Mathematics who have obtained a Ph. D. within the last three years.
     Candidates may compete for a Director's Fellowship and outstanding
      candidates will also be considered for the J. Robert Oppenheimer,
   Richard P. Feynman or Frederick Reines Fellowships. Further details are
                available at http://www.hr.lanl.gov/postdoc/.
    To be considered for a Postdoc position in T-7, you must apply to the
   Laboratory Postdoc program. A good guide for preparation of application
       materials is given at http://www.hr.lanl.gov/postdoc/guide.stm.
     In addition, the T-7 Group requests that potential students send a
        copies of their on-line application, resumé, all collegiate
    transcripts, one or two letters of recommendation and a statement of
              their research interest to the T-7 Group Office.

                              Student Programs

   The Applied Mathematics group organizes a highly active summer program
     in Mathematical Modeling and Analysis. This program is coordinated
     through the T-7 Group Office. Students collaborate with Laboratory
    Staff Members and Postdoctoral Fellows to do fundamental research. To
    see a listing of research projects and other related web pages, check
                  out the Projects or Related Links pages.
      A list of our T-7 summer projects illustrates the variety of the
                                  program.
     There are two different types of summer positions. The are either a
     regular 90-day or a 8-week or shorter assignment. These are highly
   competitive positions. Before being accepted into the program, students
   must have a Laboratory sponsor who is willing to oversee their research
     project(contact prior to application is extremely beneficial). The
    majority of the summer students in the program have already completed
      two years of graduate school and have an 'A' or high 'B' average.
   Junior graduate and undergraduate students are also considered for the
    program, but it is usually more difficult to find a sponsor. Also, it
       is usually easier to find sponsors for students who have strong
      computer skills(i.e. UNIX, Linux, C, C++, Fortran, Matlab, Maple,
                  Python, etc.) than for those who do not.
     Each student must apply through Human Resources for special student
     employment either as a graduate or undergraduate by completing the
   online application. Also, copies of all collegiate transcripts must be
                                submitted to:
                           Student Programs Office

      Returning students, if you are a returning student to the summer
    research program, you must update your online application and provide
   information that verifies active enrollment in a graduate program. (To
     update your application, you will need the same password you used a
      year ago. If you have forgotten your password, please call (505)
