   Cooperative Hazardous Materials Education (COHMED)
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Cooperative Hazardous Materials Education (COHMED) Program is an
   outreach activity of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Research
   and Special Programs Administration's (RSPA), Office of Hazardous
   Materials Initiatives and Training. It works to foster coordination,
   cooperation, and communication between Federal and state agencies and
   tribal nations having regulatory and enforcement responsibility for the
   safe transportation of hazardous materials.

   COHMED was initiated jointly in 1986 by the States and U.S. Department
   of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration. COHMED
   is comprised of Federal, state and local agencies, and industry from
   the US and Canada. COHMED is committed to improving hazardous materials
   transportation safety, and provides technical assistance, training and
   information for the development of Federal, state, and local
   enforcement programs, and fosters national uniformity in regulation and
   enforcement.

   COHMED is an intergovernmental/industry partnership serving as a focal
   point for information sharing on hazardous materials transportation
   issues and delivery of services. Through education and training, the
   states and local governments are provided with information and
   resources to enhance existing programs and develop new ones to improve
   hazardous materials safety.

   Hazardous materials present unique challenges to enforcement personnel
   and emergency responders. Effective preparedness and mitigation are
   fundamental to the reduction of exposure to the population and response
   forces. To improve preparedness and response capabilities to hazardous
   materials emergencies, COHMED cooperates with other Federal and state
   agencies, enforcement personnel, emergency planning managers,
   responders, academic institutions, interest groups, and private
   industry.

   Questions and/or comments regarding COHMED should be directed to the
   Office of Hazardous Materials Initiatives and Training either by
   telephone (202) 366-4900 or by email

     __________________________________________________________________

   COHMED goals are far-reaching and serve to assist states and local
   governments in ensuring the safe transportation of hazardous materials.
   The COHMED leadership aggressively seeks input from the states to
   facilitate long-range planning. COHMED goals include:
     * Promote hazardous materials transportation safety.
     * Promote uniform, national hazardous materials regulations and
       enforcement.
     * Promote uniform implementation of hazardous materials strategies
       and program enhancements.
     * Identify effective program elements being implemented throughout
       the states.
     * Encourage methodology transfer between state and local entities.
     * Establish enforcement data bases, utilizing existing systems such
       as:
          + HMIS, NFIRS, USCG, and RRT incident response information.
     * Develop policy and program recommendations by utilizing hazardous
       materials data.
     * Continue the State Hazardous Materials Specialist "Intern" Program
       under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA).
     * Maintain continuous, open lines of communication; to, from, and
       within participating agencies and organizations.
     * Assist in reviews of state enforcement plans.
     * Provide all participants with timely information on programs and
       services available.
     * Assist law enforcement agencies and transportation departments in
       complying with Federally mandated emergency response and training
       requirements.
