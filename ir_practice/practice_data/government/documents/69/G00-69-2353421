                            EPA Sector Notebooks

   (Scroll down to see the list of available Sector Notebooks)

     The EPA's Office of Compliance has developed a series of profiles or
     notebooks containing information on selected major industries. These
     notebooks, which focus on key indicators that holistically present
     air, water, and land pollutant release data, have been thoroughly
     reviewed by experts from both inside and outside the EPA.

   What will I find in the Notebooks?

     Each Notebook brings you comprehensive, well-researched details
     gathered for the first time in a single source and includes:

     * a comprehensive environmental profile
     * industrial process information
     * pollution prevention techniques
     * pollutant release data
     * regulatory requirements
     * compliance/enforcement history
     * government and industry partnerships
     * innovative programs
     * contact names
     * bibliographic references
     * description of research methodology

   Can I read the Notebooks on-line?

     Yes, most Internet browsers will allow you to read the PDF versions
     of the Notebooks. If your Internet browser does not allow you to
     read the pdf versions of the Notebooks on-line you may want to see
     an example Notebook, the Profile of the Metal Fabrication Industry,
     which can be read on-line (in HTML).

   Notes:

     Spanish - The Notebooks that have been translated into Spanish are
     marked by a double asterisks (**).
     Printing - If these documents do not print completely, you may have
     insufficient memory in your printer. If this is the case, printing
     only small portions of the document at one time may correct the
     problem.

   Government Series:

     An adjunct to the Industry Sector Notebook series, the government
     series is a group of associated Notebooks that are organized by
     government sector rather than a particular industry sector.

   Data Refresh:

     The Sector Notebook Data Refresh-1997 presents the latest available
     data in all of the areas that were covered in the Notebooks
     published in 1995 plus those published in 1997. The document
     presents revised sector specific data covering: emissions,
     regulatory enforcement, and compliance inspections. Though primarily
     in a format similar to that found in the Notebooks, it also includes
     graphical illustrations that enable the reader to conduct general
     cross-sector analysis.
