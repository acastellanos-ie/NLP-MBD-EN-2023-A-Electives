   No Child Left Behind:
   Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act

   Welcome to the No Child Left Behind Act homepage!

   On January 8, 2002, President Bush signed into law the No Child Left
   Behind Act of 2001. The Act, which embodies his education reform plan
   sent to Congress on January 23, 2001, is the most sweeping reform of
   the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) since ESEA was
   enacted in 1965. It redefines the federal role in K-12 education and
   will help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged and minority
   students and their peers. It is based on four basic principles:
   stronger accountability for results, increased flexibility and local
   control, expanded options for parents, and an emphasis on teaching
   methods that have been proven to work.
