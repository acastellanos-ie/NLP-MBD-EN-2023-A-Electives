   High School Programs
   NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP) is a nationwide competition
   that encourages high school students to participate in NASA research
   topics. Students compete in the areas of engineering, computation,
   journalism and art. The winner of the supercomputer division receives a
   week-long internship at Ames to conduct research at the Numerical
   Aerodynamic Simulation Facility. Contact: Tom Clausen (650) 604-5544.
   Summer High School Apprenticeship Research Program (SHARP) is designed
   to provide research work experience for underrepresented high school
   juniors. Applicants must be U.S. Citizens residing within commuting
   distance of NASA Ames Research Center. This is an 8-week summer
   program. The application deadline is March 1 of each year. Contact: Ray
   A. Hill (650) 604-1808.
   Student Space and Biology Research Program provides an opportunity for
   high school seniors be placed in a research environment at NASA Ames.
   We do not accept applications directly, but solicit nominations of one
   candidate per school from the local high schools in Santa Clara, San
   Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties. This is a volunteer program,
   and students attend lectures and work 6-8 hours per week. Contact: Tom
   Clausen (650) 604-5544.
   Student Temporary Experience Program (STEP) Ames serves as a model
   employer in providing training and work opportunities. These employees
   must be over 16 years old, US citizens, and at least half-time students
   (high school or college). Contact: studentjobs@mail.arc.nasa.gov.

   Community College and Undergraduate Programs
   Ames Associate Program The Ames Associate Program is a voluntary/unpaid
   program designed for individuals who wish to donate their services to
   NASA-Ames Research Center for the mutual benefit of Ames and
   themselves. The title "Ames Associate," (Guest Worker), is associated
   primarily with an individual who has a unique background and can make a
   major contribution to an established, ongoing, scientific program at
   Ames. This program also permits the Associate to utilize unique Ames
   facilities and work in their chosen field with experienced and eminent
   research scientists. Ames Associates are normally United States
   Citizens or Permanent Residents, (registered immigrant aliens),
   although Foreign Nationals may donate services if proper external
   approvals are obtained. Contact Karen Tanner (650) 604-6987.
   Education Associates Program (EdAP) provides work study opportunities
   for university students (enrolled in BS, MS, Ph.D.), post docs and
   faculty from any accredited 4 year university in the US. Sponsors at
   Ames who have funds to pay for work study can also visit this site to
   find information on hiring students and faculty. These sponsors can be
   either civil servants or contractors, and can pay with a NASA JO or
   with a direct purchase order from a contractor. Contact: Donna
   Zetterquist, Program Manager, (650) 604-6543.
   Foothill-DeAnza Community College District Internship and Training
   Programs The Foothill-De Anza Internship Program is conducted as a
   cooperative effort between NASA/Ames Research Center and the
   Foothill-De Anza Community College District. These internship positions
   provide paid work experience for students planning to transfer to four
   year universities, students new to or preparing for the work world, and
   students making a career change or reentering the labor market.
   Students continue to take courses at the college while working 20 hours
   per week at their NASA job site. During the summer, students work 40
   hours per week. United States citizenship is required for positions at
   NASA/Ames. Internship positions are available in a wide range of
   settings, and correspond to almost every college major. Student interns
   work directly with multimedia specialist, scientists, accountants,
   psychologists, engineers, administrators, programmers and other
   professionals as they carry out or support research related to
   information technology, aviation operation systems, and astrobiology.
   Contact: Nancy Bilderback
   Minority University Research and Education Program MUREP's mission is
   to foster the R&D capabilities of Minority Institutions (MIs) which
   contribute substantially to NASA's mission. MUREP often offers grant
   opportunities to MI's. Contact: Brenda Collins (650) 604-3540.
   NASA Scholars Each summer, the Office of External Affairs hosts NASA
   Scholars from Historically Black Colleges and Other Minority
   Institutions throughout the United States. NASA Scholars are
   exceptional undergraduate students whose fields of study range from
   engineering to computer sciences. Students participating in the NASA
   Scholars Program must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or above. Previous Ames
   sponsors can testify that these students provide outstanding support
   and are a welcome addition to the Ames community. Contact: Brenda
   Collins (650) 604-3540.
   Scholarships: Does NASA give scholarships to students? NASA does not
   directly award scholarships. However NASA does fund state consortia
   under the Space Grant and EPSCoR programs, and these consortia do have
   scholarship programs for students in member schools. Look for your
   state consortia and contact your state consortia directly.
