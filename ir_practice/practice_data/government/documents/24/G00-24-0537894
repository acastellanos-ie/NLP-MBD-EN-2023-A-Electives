   About the New APPL Web
   Erst kommt das Fressen, dann Kommt die Moral.
   First comes the belly, then morality.
        Bertolt Brecht, Three-Penny Opera
   Welcome to the new Academy of Program Project Leadership (APPL) web.
   I think Brecht was stating a fundamental challenge of humanity here-the
   hierarchy of needs. It is obvious that for anything to have value it
   must meet the needs and wants of the audience.
   The original APPL web site has generated a significant amount of
   feedback from its audience, helping us identify what our users really
   want-from improved information design to more timely and relevant
   content for practitioners. The new APPL site is a product of this
   feedback.
   The goal of the APPL web is to continually meet the needs and wants of
   project practitioners. It is intended to be a meeting place for leaders
   who want efficient and meaningful information on:

     * the latest research
     * status of training offerings
     * stories from leading experts
     * knowledge sharing
     * links to important sites
     * project tools
     * hot topics
     * learning strategies

   A key consideration of this upgrade is its design. Far more than an
   issue of looking good, a useful design provides ease of access and the
   desire to continue searching and ideally learning. The upgrade also
   provides the foundation for a significant expansion toward e-learning
   and web-based tools and materials.
   As with everything we do, it will only be successful with the active
   involvement of the program and project community. Continue to provide
   us with constant feedback of what you like and what you don't. We will
   continue to look to improve our site to meet the needs and wants of our
   customers.
   Enjoy the site and let us know what you think.
   Thanks,
   Ed [spacer.gif] [spacer.gif] [spacer.gif]
