   Privacy and Security

   The privacy of our customers has always been of utmost importance to
   the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA has a long history of
   protecting your privacy and our concern for your privacy is no
   different in the electronic age. Our Internet privacy policy is:
     * You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site.

     * We will collect personally identifiable information (name, email
       address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier) only
       if specifically and knowingly provided by you.

     * Personally identifying information you provide will be used only in
       connection with VA programs and services or for such other purposes
       as are described at the point of collection.

     * Information is collected for statistical purposes and VA sometimes
       performs analyses of user behavior in order to measure customer
       interest in the various areas of our site.

     * We do not give, sell or transfer any personal information to a
       third party.

     * We may enable "cookies." A "cookie" is a file placed on your
       personal computer's hard drive by a Web site that allows it to
       monitor your use of the site.

   information on the Federal government's Web Site Privacy Policy, see
