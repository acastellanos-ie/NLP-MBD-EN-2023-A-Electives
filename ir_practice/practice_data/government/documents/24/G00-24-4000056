   * A global nutrient (e.g., phosphate, nitrate, and silicate) database
   is also available online in the NODC Oceanographic Profile DataBase:
   search for oceanographic profiles by parameter, geographic location,
   and time; produce station location charts, parameter vs. parameter
   plots, and create datasets that can be downloaded via FTP.

   * Customized datasets of nutrients can also be obtained by contacting
   NODC User Services.
