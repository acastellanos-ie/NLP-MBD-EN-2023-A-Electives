   Sweet Home... Buying a home can be intimidating. You probably have a
   lot of questions about how to find the right home, how to finance your
   new home, and much more. "100 Questions and Answers About Buying a New
   Home" on page 8 offers some advice to guide you through this process.
   66 Ways to Save Money... Saving money can be challenging-every penny
   counts. But there is help. "66 Ways to Save Money" on page 10 offers
   prac- tical advice to help you put aside some extra cash. With these
   useful tips, saving hundreds of dollars can be as easy as shop- ping
   around for the cheapest car loan or having an energy audit performed on
   your house. Use this guide to find out about saving on transportation,
   credit, housing, food, and more. Let's Get Physical... Regular,
   moderate physical activity can help improve the way you look, feel and
   work. "Exercise and Your Heart" on page 7 provides information on the
   effects of physical activity on your heart and practical guidelines for
   starting and staying on your own exercise program. The Federal Consumer
   Information Center (FCIC) was established to help Federal agencies and
   departments develop, promote, and distribute useful consumer
   information to the public. One of the ways we do this is by publishing
   a new Consumer Information Catalog four times a year. Each quarter, we
   search out the best new consumer booklets and review those already
   listed in the Catalog for accuracy. Please be assured that FCIC does
   not share or sell any information obtained from you with any other
   organization. 2 See the full text of these publications & more at

   50¢. PUBLICATION PRICING As you look through the Catalog, you'll see
   that some booklets have an individual price and others do not. Booklets
   are offered without individual charge to the consumer if the sponsoring
   agency pays the printing and distribution costs. When a booklet has a
   sales price, the Government Printing Office (GPO) sets the price to
   cover these costs; prices vary accordingly. When a booklet is 50¢, the
   sponsoring agencies cover some of the costs paid by GPO. 12 See the
