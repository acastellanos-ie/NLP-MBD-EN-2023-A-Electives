   The Nuclear Waste Issue

   Nuclear waste is predominately comprised of used fuel discharged from
   operating nuclear reactors. In the United States, the roughly 100
   operating reactors (which currently produce about 20% of the nations
   electricity) will create about 87,000 tons of such discharged or
   spent fuel over the course of their lifetimes. Sixty thousand tons of
   this waste is destined for geologic disposal at the Yucca Mountain site
   in Nevada, along with another ~10,000 tons of so-called defense waste.
   Worldwide, more than 250,000 tons of spent fuel from reactors currently
   operating will require disposal.

   These numbers account for only high-level nuclear waste generated by
   present-day power reactors. Rather conservative projections of nuclear
   power growth worldwide in the coming decades indicate that by year
   2050, almost 1 million tons of discharged fuel requiring disposal could
   exist. Such projections would indicate the need to build and commission
   a repository on the scale of Yucca Mountain somewhere in the world
   roughly every three to four years.

   Nearly all issues related to risks to future generations arising from
   long-term disposal of such spent nuclear fuel is attributable to ~1% of
   its content. This 1% is made up primarily of plutonium, neptunium,
   americium, and curium (called transuranic elements) and long-lived
   isotopes of iodine and technetium created as products from the fission
   process in power reactors. When transuranics are removed from
   discharged fuel destined for disposal, the toxic nature of the spent
   fuel drops below that of natural uranium ore (that was originally mined
   for nuclear fuel) within a period of several hundred years. Removal of
   plutonium and other transuranics from material destined for geologic
   disposal also eliminates issues related to long-term (centuries) heat
   management within geologic environments. The removal of neptunium,
   technetium, and iodine render negligible the possibility of radioactive
   material penetration into the biosphere far in the future. Finally,
   removal of plutonium negates any incentive for future intrusion into
   repositories driven by overt or covert recovery of material for nuclear
   proliferation.

   In brief, a large nuclear waste-disposal challenge is driven by a
   relatively small amount of long-lived materials. Their removal makes
   long-term disposal of remaining, more benign materials increasingly
   straightforward and robust. The problem of addressing the long-term
   residues can be done in controlled environments having time scales of a
   few centuries rather than millennia.

   Transmutation of Nuclear Waste

   Transmutation Explained - Transmutation is defined as nuclear
   transformation and describes processes that have occurred naturally
   since the origin of the universe. Radioactive dating of fossils is
   based on a measurement of the natural decay of carbon-14 to nitrogen,
   reflecting the amount of transmutation that has occurred over time, and
   thereby implying how much time has passed since the object was formed.
   Transmutation occurs every time the nucleus of an atom changes because
   of natural radioactive decay, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, neutron
   capture, or numerous other processes.

   Man has had the ability to cause transmutations to occur throughout
   most of the twentieth century, relying on the fission transmutation
   process to release and harness nuclear energy since the 1950s. Most
   transmutation processes that are induced involve the use of nuclear
   reactors or particle accelerators. For example, many radioisotope used
   in medical procedures today are produced in reactors or by using
   particle beams from accelerators. In principle, any radioisotope can be
   produced or destroyed using nuclear transformations, although some
   transmutations are easier to induce than others.

   Advantages of Transmutation - Used nuclear fuel contains several
   unstable nuclei in sufficient quantities to render the material quite
   hazardous for a prolonged period of time. The process of disposing of
   the spent nuclear fuel carries an obligation to isolate these materials
   from the environment for a period estimated to range from 10,000 years
   to perhaps millions of years. These time periods challenge mans
   abilities to engineer long-lasting containers and barriers, and
   therefore force some reliance on predictions of geologic behavior to
   assure the required long-term isolation from the environment.

   Nuclear waste transmutation is an option that arises when one examines
   the hazards in the spent nuclear fuel. The long-term hazards are posed
   by about 1% of the content of the spent fuel, including the plutonium,
   neptunium, americium, curium, iodine, and technetium, leaving the other
   99% relatively harmless over the long term. Further, the isotopes that
   are present in the problematical 1% can be converted to either stable
   or short-lived hazards when exposed to neutrons in an appropriate
   energy range. Finally, most of the materials in the 1% (the
   transuranics) will fission, releasing large amounts of energy.

   There are three major beneficial impacts that can result from
   transmuting these problematic waste components. First, we can greatly
   reduce the amount of long-lived hazards and the need to provide for
   nearly total isolation for many thousands (perhaps millions) of years.
   It also reduces the need to attempt to provide control of geologic (and
   climatic) behavior in the distant future, shifting the isolation burden
   into the time frame of man-made containers and barriers. Second, the
   partitioning and transmutation process allows for the use of optimized
   waste forms, which can be highly resistant to leaching and other
   natural processes that might transport hazardous materials. Third, by
   transmuting most of the transuranics, such as plutonium, one greatly
   reduces any incentive for future generations to re-enter (or mine) the
   repository.

   Summary - In brief, transmutation applied to nuclear waste allows us
   to:
     * reduce the volume, toxicity, and fissile content of waste now
       requiring repository disposal;
     * reduce materials that create proliferation and environmental risks;
       and
     * support a simpler repository.
