      Cyclophosphamide is an important alkylating agent that has a curative
      potential for various malignant tumors. DNA interstrand cross-links appear
      to be the primary cytotoxic adduct and the base of anti-tumor activity of
      phosphoramide compounds. Many studies have suggested that DNA interstrand
      cross-links induced by alkylating agents prevent the separation of the
      strands of the DNA helix and thus inhibit DNA replication. The figure
      shows a snapshot from a molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry study,
      with complementary experiments, in learning how a nitrogen mustard cross
      link forms in DNA. For further infomation, please write for reprints of
