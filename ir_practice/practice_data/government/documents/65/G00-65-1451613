     Court Governance


       Utah Judicial Council

       The Utah Judicial Council is the policy-making body for the
       judiciary. It has the constitutional authority to adopt uniform
       rules for the administration of all the courts in the state. The
       Council also sets standards for judicial performance, court
       facilities, support services, and judicial and non-judicial staff
       levels.

       The Council consists of fourteen members. The Chief Justice of the
       Supreme Court chairs the Council. The other members include: a
       Supreme Court Justice; a judge of the Court of Appeals; five
       District Court judges; two Juvenile Court judges; three Justice
       Court judges; a state bar representative; and the State Court
       Administrator, who serves as secretariat to the Council. The judges
       serve three-year terms, and the state bar representative also serves
       three years. List of current Judicial Council members.

       By rule, the Judicial Council established a Board of Judges for each
       level of court. Boards of Judges adopt administrative rules in
       accordance with the guidelines of the Council, advise the Council,
       supervise the implementation of Council policies and serve as
       liaisons between judges and the Council.

       The Judicial Council holds monthly meetings throughout the state.

       They provide an opportunity for other branches of government,
       federal agencies, and citizens to present issues and concerns
       directly to the judiciary.

       The Administrative Office of the Courts

       The Court Administrator Act, passed in 1973 and revised in 1986,
       provides for the appointment of a State Court Administrator, an
       individual with professional ability and experience in the field of
       public administration and an understanding of court procedures and
       services. The State Court Administrator is assisted by a Deputy
       Administrator, District, Juvenile, and Justice Court Administrators,
       trial court executives, and management personnel in the following
       areas: Human Resources, Public Information, Planning and Research,
       Finance, Information Technology, Information Services, Audit and
       General Counsel. The Administrative Office of the Courts serves as
       staff to the Judicial Council, rules committees, boards of judges,
       standing and ad hoc committees, and nominating commissions and
       provides support to Clerks of Court and Trial Court Executives
       throughout the state.
