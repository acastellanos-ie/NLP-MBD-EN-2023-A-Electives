     In July 2001, NRCS hosted six public meetings to gather comments on
   the role of private sector vendors in helping owners and operators of
   animal feeding operations develop and implement comprehensive nutrient
   management plans. Topics included:
     * Manure and wastewater handling and storage
     * Land treatment practices
     * Nutrient management
     * Record keeping
     * Feed management
     * Other manure and wastewater utilization activities

   The public was encouraged to provide answers and comments to the
   following questions:
    1. What do you believe the role of private sector vendors should be in
       providing technical services to animal feeding operation/confined
       animal feeding operation (AFO/CAFO) owners and operators with the
       development and implementation of their comprehensive nutrient
       management plans (CNMPs)? Is there a distinction in this role as
       regards to regulated versus non-regulated AFOs?
    2. What are the technical capabilities and capacities of private
       sector vendors in relation to the skills, knowledge, and experience
       needed to provide technical services associated with the
       development and/or implementation of CNMPs?
    3. How do you see the capabilities and capacities of the private
       sector vendor community changing over the next few years? Over the
       next decade?
    4. What is needed for a successful public/private partnership that
       will facilitate AFO/CAFO owners and operators development and/or
       implementation of CNMPs?
