     New Individual Short Application For Insurance License is Available
                        [For Current Licensees Only]

   The California Department of Insurance's (CDI) Producer Licensing
   Bureau is continually looking for ways to make your application process
   faster and easier.   In that regard, we have created an Individual
   Short Form 441-17* application.  Current licensees who would like to
   add another license type may use the California Department of
   Insurances new Short Form 441-17*.  bs01064_.wmf (8916 bytes)
              _________________________________________________

   Short Form - Ease of Use

   The Short Form (441-17*) has only two pages for the applicant to
   complete in order to add another license type to his or her license.  A
   life agent, for example, would complete only a two-page application
   (Short Form, 441-17*) to add a fire and casualty license type to his or
   her license instead of having to complete the six page Individual
   Application (Form 441-9*). It is no longer necessary for the licensee
   to provide the background information that Individual Application (Form
   441-9*) requires each time the licensee adds a new license type to his
   or her license.  That information is already in the CDI's licensing
   database. The Short Form's (441-17*) two-page application is convenient
   for licensees and, saves time and paper work.
