            Welcome To The B N L Tandem Van de Graaff Accelerator
                             TVDG LET Calculator

   This program calculates the Peak LET, Corresponding Energy and Range as
   well as the LET and Range at the Specified Energy for the Specified Ion
   in the Specified Target.
     * Select the Target Material from the dropdown list.
     * Select the Ion Specie from the dropdown list.
     * Enter the Ion Energy in the text box.
     * Click the 'Calculate' button or press the 'Enter' key.

   The Peak LET, Corresponding Energy and Range as well as the LET and
   Range at the Specified Energy for the Specified Ion in the Specified
   Target will be returned.

   Select your Target from the list
   [Silicon_________] Select your Ion from the list
   [1 Hydrogen 1____] Enter Ion Energy
   ______ MeV

Terms and Definitions

   LET
          Linear Energy Transfer is the energy absorbed by the target
          through which a particle is traveling per unit length of the
          track of the particle. For the purposes of this calculator, the
          LET is expressed in units of MeV/mg/cm^2 (Million electron volts
          per milligram per square centimeter).

   Range
          The distance a particle of a given energy will travel through
          the target until it is stopped. For the purposes of this
          calculator, the Range is expressed in microns.

   Peak LET
          The maximum value the LET can assume with the specified
          materials (ion and target).

   Energy for Peak LET
          The energy at which the Peak LET occurs.
