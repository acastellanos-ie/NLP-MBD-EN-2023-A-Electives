   Welcome to the Home Page for the U. S. Department of Energy's Spectrum
   Management Program.

   The purpose of this Web site is to promote and publicize Spectrum
   Management, which is quite possibly the single most critically
   important Program in the Department of Energy (DOE).  Without the
   Spectrum Management Program, which manages the licensed use of the
   electromagnetic spectrum in support of every business line in DOE,
   critical mission functions would not be allowed to operate.  Just as
   the highest technology automobile is of little use if the vehicle is
   not registered with the proper authority, and the vehicle cannot be
   operated without a driver's license, the Department's radio
   communication and spectrum-dependent systems cannot be planned,
   procured, or constructed without certification from the National
   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and cannot
   operate or transmit radio frequency energy without a license.  This is
   mandated by Public Laws, United States Code, Presidential Executive
   Order, OMB policy, and national regulation.

   The mission of the Spectrum Management Program is to see to it that DOE
   systems get certified, frequencies get licensed, and most importantly,
   that DOE positions are defended by a voting member Representative on
   the national and international policy-making forums that govern the
   regulated use of the spectrum.  Every DOE office, field site, compound,
   national laboratory, and weapons facility depends on the spectrum to
   support their operations, whether for power grid control, electricity
   transmission, satellite control for nuclear proliferation detection,
   Nuclear Emergency Search Team deployment, radiological assistance,
   transportation safeguards, perimeter protection, intrusion detection,
   environmental remote sensing, wildlife monitoring, seismic monitoring,
   radar, fusion energy research, cyclotron operation, remote controlled
   robotics and machinery operation, land mobile radio, wireless networks,
   or paging services.  DOE has the largest government-owned and operated
   VHF trunked radio system, is the largest Federal user of pagers,
   controls power grids for over half of the land mass of the continental
   United States, and supports global nuclear proliferation detection, all
   of which are dependent on the spectrum.

   We hope this Web site will help advance the understanding of just how
   critically important the Spectrum Management Program is to the core
   business lines and mission function operations of DOE.  For more
