   [dot_green.jpg]  Introduction: Searching the DMS

   Docketed information is stored in the DMS database. This information
   can be located by performing a search on the database. There are
   several ways to define a search on the database, some of which are
   explained in detail below.  To find out more about Dockets go to our
   About Dockets information page.

                                     TOP
   [dot_green.jpg]  Defining a Search:   Most searches fall into two
   categories.  The first is a specific search where you know some
   information and want to find out the details.  For example, if you want
   to find out about a recall recently made for your automobile, or, when
   planes are allowed to land at your airport.  The second search is
   general, where you want to find out more information about a subject.
   For example, airbag legislation or accident statistics.

   [dot_green.jpg]  Search the DMS Web

   [dot_blue.jpg]  By Docket ID: The identifier for a docket.
       * This is the quickest and easiest way to perform a search.
       The Docket number is comprised of three parts and the Item Number
       (or Document ID) adds a fourth part, identifying its place within
       the docket.  When you want to search the system with an ID, you
       must break the number into its components.  The hyphenated
       components are AGENCY - CY (Calendar Year) - DOCKET ID - ITEM
       NUMBER and it will appear similar to this:

                              OST-1999-1234-56
       For a Docket ID search you may ONLY enter 1234 into the Docket ID
       field.
       Once you have searched for a Docket number your search results will
       be displayed on the Hit List.  Please proceed to the Hit List
       section of this tutorial by following the link to the Hit List
       help.

   [dot_blue.jpg]   By Keyword: A word that appears ONLY in the Docket
       Subject, Docket Title and Document Title
       * This is search takes longer than a search by Docket ID..
       All Dockets are titled.  They also have a subject to quickly
       describe the content of the Docket.  Every Document with a Docket
       is titled as well.  With a keyword search you may enter a word (or
       words) into the keyword field and search the three areas at once.
       This is especially useful if you do not have a Docket Number but
       know the content of the Docket or Document.
       Once you have searched for a keyword your search results will be
       displayed on the Hit List. Please proceed to the Hit List section
       of this tutorial by following the link to the Hit List help.

   [dot_blue.jpg] By Search Form: The most complete way to perform a
       search.
       The DMS Search Form allows you to search every variable within our
       database.  If you know only certain facts about a Docket/Document
       you may need to use this form.  This is also useful if you want to
       find other Dockets/Documents that have similarities in any way.
       Continue reading to learn more about performing a search using the
       Search Form.

                                     TOP

   [dot_green.jpg]  The Search Form

   [dot_blue.jpg]  The Parts of the Search Form
       Each Docket has several amounts of information stored into our
       database.  Each Document also has information that is stored there.
       If you go to the search form page you will see a representation of
       all the information that is searchable in our database.  The
       following section will explain some of the commonly searched areas
       of the search form.
       There are two halfs to the Search Form.  The top half is the Docket
       Information.  All the information about a Docket is searchable
       through the top most half.   The lower half is the Document
       Information. This information is specifically about the Document.
        [dot_blue.jpg]  By Docket ID:  The identifier for a Docket.
            * This is the quickest and easiest way to perform a search.
            The Docket number is comprised of three parts, Agency,
            Calendar Year (CY) and Docket ID number. If there is an Item
            Number (or Document ID) it will add a fourth part, identifying
            its place within the docket.  When you want to search the
            system by a Docket ID, you must break the number into its
            components.  The hyphenated components, in order, are AGENCY -
            CY (Calendar Year) - DOCKET ID - ITEM NUMBER and it will
            appear similar to this:

                              OST-1999-1234-56
            For a Docket ID search you need only enter 1234 into the
            Docket ID field.
            In addition to the Docket ID you may also search with the Item
            Number.  This is the position of the Document with in the
            Docket.  If you have the number of one particular document you
            may enter it in to the field called "Item #".  This can make
            your search results more focused and have fewer inaccurate
            matches.
            With the Docket ID and Item # you will be able to find a
            specific document.  The Agency and Calendar Year are
            redundant.  Each Docket has a unique Docket ID but there may
            be many Documents within a single Docket. So there could be
            several Documents with same Docket ID but each Document has a
            unique Docket ID and Item # combination. So when used together
            you can find a single document.
            Try this search.

   [dot_blue.jpg]   By Agency:The Office within DOT to whom the docket
       belongs.
       There is an agency list online which also shows how many dockets
       each agency currently has in the system.  An agency search alone
       will return many results, so you should combine selection of an
       agency with other search criteria to help focus your search.
       Use the drop down menu by clicking on the down arrow on the right
       hand side of the box. Select the Agency you wish to search on and
       then click on the "Search" button in the upper right hand corner.
       This will return all the dockets/documents that Agency currently
       has in the DMS.
       Try this search.

   [dot_blue.jpg]  By Category:  The type of docket being entered into the
       system
       Each docket data entered into the DMS is listed under a specific
       category of information. The category describes what type of
       information is contained in a particular docket or document.  These
       categories are predefined in the DMS and can be accessed via a
       drop-down list box on the Category field.   To view the list, click
       on the down arrow in the field. Select the Category you wish to
       search for and click on "Search" in the upper right hand corner.
       Try this search.
       Categories are agency specific, meaning they vary between the
       different agencies in the DMS.  There is a full list of all
       agencies and their categories.

   [dot_blue.jpg]  By Data Entry Date:  The date the document was entered
       into the DMS
       There are several ways this field can be used to search for a
       docket/document.
        1.  Enter the exact date you wish to search. The date format used
            for this is dd-mon-yyyy. For example, if you wish to search
            for dockets/documents entered on January 1, 2000 you would
            insert the date in the Data Entry Date field as 01-JAN-2000.
            Try this search.
            2. You can search for a date that is greater than a date. For
            example, if you wish to find all the dockets/documents that
            were placed into the DMS after January 1, 2000, you would
            enter the date in the Data Entry Date field using the greater
            than sign (>) and the date (remember the date is dd-mon-yyyy).
            >01-JAN-2000
            Try this search.
            3. Likewise, you can do a search for the dockets/documents
            entered in the DMS before a certain date. As an example, if
            you wish to get a list of all the dockets/documents in the DMS
            before January 1, 2000 you can enter the date using the less
            than sign (<). <01-JAN-2000 NOTE: If you choose to use this
            form of date search, we suggest you further narrow the search
            criteria by selecting an Agency or Docket Subject to add to
            your search. Otherwise, the search will take quite a bit of
            time and return a very large number of results.
            Try this search.

   [dot_blue.jpg]  By Docket Subject:  A brief description of subject
       matter.
       The Docket Subject describes what the case (or docket) is about.
       For instance, you want to search for all the dockets/documents that
       have anything to do air bags in vehicles. The easiest way is to do
       a "wild card" search. This is done by surround the word or words
       you enter in the field with percent signs (%). So, to search for
       dockets/documents about air bags you would type %Air Bag%.
       Additionally if you select "dockets only" at the top left hand
       corner of the search form, you will see only the dockets listed.
       You can, however, have both the dockets and documents listed (this
       would be a very long list and take some time for you to find what
       you were looking for).
       Try this search.

   [dot_blue.jpg]  By Other Docket/Document information:
       You can find a brief description of all other entry information on
       the search form by clicking on the field names.  If you are having
       any problems or have any additional questions you may contact us
       through our support page.

   [dot_green.jpg]  Search Results or The Document Hit List

   Once matches to your search have been found they are displayed in a
   list.  This list is known as the Document Hit List.  There is also a
   possibility of getting no results. In this case, you should be less
   specific with your search criteria.

   The information contained in the Document Hit List is:

   [dot_blue.jpg]  Docket/Document Number::
       This character/number combination is the complete Docket ID. It
       consists of the Agency-Calender Year (year in which the docket was
       created)-numeric Docket ID, and, if it is a document search, the
       Item Number of the document. A complete description of Document ID
       format is available above. The item number is generated
       sequentially by the system each time a new document is added under
       a docket.  The item number will not be present if you select the
       "Search Dockets Only" radio button since only dockets will be
       listed.
       [dot_blue.jpg]  Document Type:
       This refers to the category to which the docket or document
       belongs.
       [dot_blue.jpg]  Document Title:
       Full title of the document.

   If you only listed dockets, an intermediate docket only list will
   appear before the docket/document list.  Once the desired document is
   located in the Hit List, click on the Docket/Document ID to view the
   Docket/Document Information page.
                                     TOP
   [dot_green.jpg]  The Docket/Document Information Screen

   Once a document has been selected, all of the docket information as
   well as the document information is listed on the Docket/Document
   Information screen.  The top half of the screen displays the docket
   information and the bottom half displays the document information.
   Following is an explanation of the buttons you will see on screen (most
   are on the bottom).

   [dot_blue.jpg]  Hide/Show docket Info:
       When using the prev and next buttons, you are moving between the
       documents within a docket. Since the docket information will stay
       the same, this button gives you the option of hiding the docket
       information so that you do not have to scroll down to see the
       document information.
       [dot_blue.jpg]  New Search:
       Use this button to return to the search form and execute a new
       search.
       [dot_blue.jpg]  Prev:
       Use this button to go to the previous document within the docket -
       not within your search results. If there is no previous document as
       with Item number 1, the button will not appear.
       [dot_blue.jpg]  Next:
       Use this button to view the next document within the docket - not
       within your search results. If there are no additional documents,
       the button will not appear.
       [dot_blue.jpg]  View Image:
       Use this button to see the scanned images of a document.  All
       images are currently in TIFF format and Adobe PDF format, so you
       will need a viewer or plug-in.
       [dot_blue.jpg]  Image Size:
       This link will show you the size of the image for both the PDF and
       TIFF files.
       [dot_blue.jpg]  Dok/Doc Abstract:
       Use this button to read summary and/or reference information for a
       docket/document. These buttons will not appear if an abstract is
       not available.

                                     TOP
   [dot_green.jpg]  Printing a Document

   Your Internet Browser's printing option can be used to print
   documents.  There is usually a print button in the toolbar and under
   one of your menu items.  If you are viewing a TIFF image, you should
   still be able to print the page, but that will be dependent upon the
   TIFF viewer or plug-in you have selected.
