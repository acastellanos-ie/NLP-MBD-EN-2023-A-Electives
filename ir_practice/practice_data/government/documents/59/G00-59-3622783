            of the Branch are to identify and quantify the risk of cancer
            in populations exposed to ionizing radiation, alone or in
            combination with cytotoxic drugs, and to explore and formulate
            models of radiation carcinogenesis that may help define basic
            mechanisms of cancer induction. Approaches include the
            integration of experimental findings with epidemiologic

                 leads the Department of Energy's efforts to tell the
                 agency's Cold War story of radiation research using human
                 subjects. We have undertaken an intensive effort to
                 identify and catalog relevant historical documents from
                 DOE's 3.2 million cubic feet of records scattered across
                 the country. Internet access to these resources is a key
                 part of making DOE more open and responsive to the
                 American public.
               o Office of Human Radiation Experiments, Final ReportThe
                 final report of the committee contains a historical
                 perspective on the ethics of research using human
                 subjects, case studies of the particular experiments that
                 were performed on Americans during the period 1944-1974,
                 an inquiry into the current state of human subjects
                 research and the policies governing it, and the
                 committee's findings and recommendations. Also included
                 are the reservations of committee member Jay Katz, who
                 argues that the recommendations of the committee do not
                 fully address the problems of human subjects research.
                 Appended to the report is the executive order that
                 created the committee, and its charter, as well as
                 glossaries and a selected bibliography. A search feature

            available, and can be searched on those criteria. Search help

            beginning their searches through the vital records at the

            site. Organized by state and then by county, these pages
            present instructions on how to make inquiries concerning vital
            records. In addition to general guidelines on what data to
            include in a request for birth, marital, and death records,
            each state's page has addresses for both state and county
            records offices and information about fees. All fifty states
            and several US possessions are included. There are also links
            to other local and national genealogy resources, as well as
            state and local historical societies, which can often be a
            good source for genealogical information.
