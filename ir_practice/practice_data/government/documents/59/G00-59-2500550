ITS Mission

   The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences is the chief research and
   engineering arm of the National Telecommunications and Information
   Administration (NTIA). ITS supports such NTIA telecommunications
   objectives as promotion of advanced telecommunications and information
   infrastructure development in the United States, enhancement of
   domestic competitiveness, improvement of foreign trade opportunities
   for U.S. telecommunications firms, and facilitation of more efficient
   and effective use of the radio spectrum.

   ITS also serves as a principal Federal resource for solving the
   telecommunications concerns of other Federal agencies, state and local
   Governments, private corporations and associations, and international
   organizations.

   Cooperative research agreements based upon the Federal Technology
   Transfer Act of 1986 are the principal means of aiding the private
   sector. This Act provides the legal basis for and encourages shared use
   of Government facilities and resources with the private sector in
   advanced telecommunications technologies. These partnerships aid in the
   commercialization of new products and services.

History of ITS

   The Institute began in the 1940s as the Interservice Radio Propagation
   Laboratory, which later became the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory
   (CRPL) of the National Bureau of Standards in the U.S. Department of
   Commerce. In 1965, CRPL became part of the Environmental Science
   Services Administration (ESSA) and was renamed the Institute for
   Telecommunication Sciences and Aeronomy (ITSA). In 1967, the
   telecommunications function of ITSA was transferred into the newly
   formed Office of Telecommunications (OT) which was operated directly
   out of the White House.

   Finally, under the President's Reorganization Act #1 of 1977, OT and
   the Office of Telecommunications Policy merged to form the National
   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Since that
   time, ITS has performed telecommunications research and provided
   technical engineering support to NTIA and to other Federal agencies on
   a reimbursable basis.

   Over the past decade, ITS has expanded its historical role by
   conducting cooperative research and development with U.S. industry and
   academia under the provisions of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of
   1986.
