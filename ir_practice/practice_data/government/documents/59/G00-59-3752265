                                   Imaging

      NASA's images can be extremely colorful, but it is not possible to
   describe once and for all the significance of the many colors in these
    images. Their meaning varies, depending on what the colors are being
                  used to represent in a particular image.
   Are you a scientist working on a NASA project, and do you have an image
      gallery you would like to share with visitors to our site? If so,
       please send us the URL for review and possible inclusion on the
                             Oceanography site.

                             Imaging Background

     False Color Imagery: Ocean observing satellites collect raw data that
   measures a specific geophysical feature of the state of the ocean using
   radar, or light not in the visible spectrum. These streams of raw data
     are then converted into color-coded maps that represent a specific
   condition of the ocean in a moment in time, over the course of a week,
         month, year, decade - whatever the time span being studied.
   Calibration and Validation: In order to ensure that the satellite data
     are accurate, scientists use calibration and validation methods. By
     collecting data directly from the ocean surface and from within the
      ocean scientists can then compare these in-situ measurements with
   satellite measurements. Thus calibration and validation techniques help
           us assure the accuracy of the satellite-collected data.
   Time Studies: Once scientists believe they have modified the satellite
    data to create the most accurate representations of the condition of
    the ocean they can then study changes over time. The review of these
   changes help scientist then predict what the ocean may do in the future
                  and the impact it will have on our lives.
     Simulations: Important in the review of data over time is that this
     enables scientists to create simulation packages that will help us
    predict what the ocean will do in the future. By utilizing simulation
    techniques that chronicle and predict ocean activities scientists are
     better able to anticipate the oceans' role in weather and climate.

        NASA's Earth Observatory showcases NASA's latest Earth science
      research, focusing on global climate change, remote sensing, and
                               unusual events.

                     Ocean Images from the Space Shuttle

         Although we often use color-coded images to represent various
    characteristics of our oceans, NASA has also collected many beautiful
    true-color images of our oceans and coastal areas. Below are links to
           some of NASA's photo galleries that feature our oceans:
