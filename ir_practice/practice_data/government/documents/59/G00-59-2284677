   The President and Vice President's strategy of fiscal discipline
   combined with opening foreign markets and investing in the American
   people has led to unprecedented economic progress. The United States is
   enjoying the longest economic expansion in history; the lowest
   unemployment rate in 30 years; the most new jobs ever created under a
   single administration; the highest homeownership rate in history; the
   lowest poverty rate in twenty years and the largest five-year drop in
   child poverty since the 1960s.
