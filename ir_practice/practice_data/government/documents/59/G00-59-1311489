   Data and Products

      Where can I obtain IGS data/products? From [year]?
             Tracking data and orbit products are archived at the IGS Data
             Centers. Access and directory information for each DC is
             available in the Data & Products area of this site. Products are
             also available directly from the Central Bureau here.

      Are there costs/restrictions?
             Data and products are currently available, free of charge, to
             all users. Although the IGS strives for the highest quality of
             data and data products, it can not make any warranty, express or
             implied, or assume any legal liability or responsibility for the
             accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information or
             product. Use of the IGS data and products is the sole
             responsibility of the user.

      How accurate are they?
             You can find a table of product accuracies on the Products page.

      What are qualitative/quantitative differences in Analysis Center
             products?
             Each of the Analysis Centers employs different software and a
             unique set of measurement and orbit models to produce weekly
             solutions, which are then used to generate the IGS orbit
             combination. Summaries of various AC processing strategies are
             provided here, along with contact information and technical
             references for further study. Weekly reports from the ACs and
             combination reports from the AC Coordinator are distributed via
             IGS Report. (See a sample combination report for week 1134.)

      Where can I find GPS navigation message files?
             Both RINEX observation and navigation files are available from
             most Data Centers. Go to the Data page for more information.

      Meteorological observation files?
             These are provided in RINEX format by several of the Data
             Centers (currently CDDIS, GODC, IGN and NRCan). Go to the Data
             page for more information.

      Specifications for the [...] data format?
             Information on RINEX, SINEX, SP3 and other data formats used
             within the IGS can be found here.

      Software for [...]?
             Look here for data verification and compression tools developed
             for various platforms. An Analysis Center may be able to offer
             assistance on more complex needs (data conversion, processing,
             etc.). Get AC contact information here.

      Information on the GPS constellation status?
             The Central Bureau maintains current GPS constellation
             information here.

   Stations

      Where can I find coordinates/velocities for station [...]?
             Approximate coordinates for each site are listed on the Stations
             page. Precise coordinates, in the ITRF reference frame, are
             available here. In addition, station solutions in SINEX format
             are produced by Analysis Centers and Associate ACs participating
             in the Densification Project. These weekly SINEX files are
             available at the CDDIS and IGN Data Centers.

      In the [...] reference frame? At epoch [...]?
             The IGS is committed to improving and extending the IERS
             Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). Station coordinates from
             ITRF92 through ITRF96 are available here, and transformation
             source and documentation are available at NRCan. The WGS 84
             reference frame is coincident with the ITRF at a level better
             than 2 cm.

      What is the status of station [...]?
             For the most current information -- logs, performance, mail and
             pictures -- go the Stations page and click on the corresponding
             site .

      Do you have sites in the vicinity of [...]? Is there one being planned?
             View the clickable map in the Network area of this site. This
             map is updated daily and reflects the most current configuration
             of the network. Ask us regarding stations which are resolving
             communications and data paths.

      How can my site become an IGS station? What are your implementation
             procedures and requirements?
             Read the full procedure here. At some point it will be necessary
             to fill out and submit a site log to the Central Bureau.

      Whom should I contact with my satellite-, receiver- and
             antenna-specific questions?
             Send your questions to the Central Bureau and we'll do our best
             to answer them. If we can't we will forward your query to the
             appropriate contacts within the IGS.

      Why does the official IGS igs_01.pcv table differ from the NGS
             calibration tables? Which one should I use?
             igs_01.pcv is the official table to be used in IGS analysis. And
             yes, it does differ from NGS' latest table, and even if you look
             closely, also from NGS' previous table. The history is that some
             years back, NGS and other groups doing calibrations collaborated
             to make a definitive IGS table by averaging the various
             measurements available. Some time later the NGS table you see
             now came out. We have not updated the IGS values to NGS' latest
             in all cases for a few reasons:

             + we want to limit changes in IGS analysis to avoid jumps
             + need new effort to determine "best" values to use (it is
               thought now that averaging might mask some information)

             We currently have an ad-hoc committee which is working to obtain
             quality satellite pcv tables, which would enable use of absolute
             rather than relative calibrations in a future update of the
             igs_01.pcv file.

             At present, when we get an antenna not yet in igs_01.pcv, we
             inquire with a few regional networks such as EUREF whether they
             have any calibrations for it, and if not, we add the current NGS
             value.

             In short, if you are doing IGS analysis you should be using
             igs_01.pcv. If not you should just be certain whatever you
             choose is consistent with your requirements.

   Mail and Publications

      Do you have regular mailing lists?
             The Central Bureau maintains several mailing lists: IGS Mail --
             updates and announcements; IGS Report -- regular Analysis and
             Data Center reports; IGLOS Mail -- pertaining to the
             International GLONASS Service Pilot Project; AFREF Mail -- mail
             for discussion of an African GPS initiative, and SCIGN Mail --
             mail for the Southern California Integrated GPS Network. Receive
             them automatically or browse them in the Mail area of this site.

      I am a station operator; when should I send IGS Mails?
             Please see Standards for IGS Stations and Operational Centers
             for some guidelines.

      How do I send e-mail to the mailing lists?
             To send a message to an IGS mailing list, email it to
             listname@igscb.jpl.nasa.gov , substituting the listname
             (igsmail, iglosmail, igsleo, or afref) for listname. Please
             ensure the first line of the body of your message starts with
             the string "Author: " followed by the names of the author(s) of
             the message. Also, the Subject field of the email should not be
             blank.

             + Send plain ASCII text only
             + Do not send attachments
             + Do not send HTML mail

             For example, the following text between the horizontal lines
             meets the format (if not content) requirements for IGS Mail if
             sent in a plain text email with a non-null Subject field.
