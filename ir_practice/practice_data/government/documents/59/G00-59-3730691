                                            The following web pages have been offered by "teachers for teachers".
   Some of the web pages are educational topics while others are just
   fun stuff! If, as a teacher, you would like to post something of
   general interest or for classroom use, please email it in text format,
   clarisworks format or word format to NEWTON's Curriculum Coordinator.
   We will develop the web page for you and post it. Pictures may be
   attached files.
