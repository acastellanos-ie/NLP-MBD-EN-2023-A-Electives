          Nutrients(12MAR01)

     Data from the Census of Agriculture were used to estimate
     populations of beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and poultry,
     quantities manure produced, and land available for manure
     application A descriptive analysis is presented of the temporal and
     spatial changes in the number, size, and kind of livestock
     operations, and the changes in animal units, quantity of manure
     nutrients produced, land available for manure application, and
     excess manure nutrients at both the farm level and the county level.
