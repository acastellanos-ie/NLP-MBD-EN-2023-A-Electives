   Area Served

   The Southwestern Cotton Ginning Research Laboratory serves the
   irrigated Southwestern Region of the Cotton Belt made up of Arizona,
   California, New Mexico and the extension District 6 area of El Paso and
   Pecos, Texas. Known for its long growing season, this region produces
   upland cottons and extra-long-staple Pima cotton, famous for its
   high-quality fibers which grow well in the dry, sunny climate of the
   Southwest.

   Why Ginning Research?

   Ginning research is vital to the growth and well-being of the cotton
   and ginning industries, which depend on research developments to make
   ginning easier and more profitable. Consumers also benefit from ginning
   research developments. New developments mean better ginning methods,
   and better ginning methods result in more affordable and higher-quality
   textile products for everyone.


   Research Studies Develop, Test, and Adapt New Ginning Methods and
   Equipment

   At the Southwestern Cotton Ginning Research Laboratory, we continually
   seek ways to improve every aspect of ginning. Our research programs in
   saw and roller ginning cover all major stages of the ginning process,
   from seed-cotton conditioning and cleaning, to ginning and lint
   cleaning. Conducted by our team of engineers, physicists, and shop
   personnel, the aim of these research studies is to develop, test, and
   adapt new ginning equipment and techniques that will: (1) increase lint
   production and its value, (2) preserve the quality of the cotton fiber,
   and (3) reduce or eliminate the air pollution associated with cotton
   ginning, at minimum cost to the farmer and the cotton gin.

   Many of our research programs are conducted in cooperation with the
   USDA ginning laboratories in Stoneville, Mississippi and Lubbock,
   Texas. Together we work on research projects to benefit the ginning
   industry throughout the Cotton Belt, but with an emphasis on solving
   those problems unique to the area we serve.

   In order to deal more effectively with the problems associated with
   cotton ginning, our research staff also works with a number of other
   government and independent organizations throughout the U.S.
   Organizations, such as Cotton Inc. and the USDA Agricultural Marketing
   Service, as well as ginning equipment manufacturers and privately-owned
   gins, contribute to the success of our research programs with their
   knowledge and firsthand experience. Other organizations whose input
   also proves useful to our research programs include the National Cotton
   Council, Supima Association of America, and national and state Cotton
   Ginner's Associations.


   Research Facilities

   For ginning research to be successful, experimental conditions at the
   research lab must reflect operating conditions at the commercial gin
   plant. So that we can conduct and evaluate our research programs more
   effectively, research facilities at the Southwestern Cotton Ginning
   Research Laboratory include a saw- and roller-ginning laboratory fully
   equipped with seed cotton driers and cleaners, saw- and roller-gin
   stands, as well as lint cleaners and bale presses. Research facilities
   at the lab also include a machine shop where we construct our own
   experimental machines, complete with sheet-metal tools, welders, and
   wood-working tools.
