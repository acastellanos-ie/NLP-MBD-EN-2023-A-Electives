         Do you want information about USGS water-quality activities?
PROGRAMS USGS offices in every State conduct studies of surface-water
         and ground-water quality in cooperation with local and State
         governments and with other Federal Agencies. Contacts are available in
         each state to assist with any questions. National Programs that address
         water-quality issues include: Drinking Water Programs, Hydrologic
         Benchmark Network, National Atmospheric Deposition Program, National
         Irrigation Water Quality Program, National Stream Quality Accounting
         Network, National Water-Quality Assessment Program, Toxic Substances
         Hydrology Program, which includes the Abandoned Mine Lands Initiative,
         and USGS Assistance for TMDLs.

   PUBLICATIONS Information about the quality of the Nation's
   surface-water and ground-water resources is available through On-Line
   Water-Resources Reports, Selected Water-Resources Abstracts and other
   USGS Publications and Products.

   DATA The USGS collects, analyzes, archives, and disseminates data and
        information describing the quality of the Nation's surface-water and
        ground-water resources.

   LABS The National Water Quality Laboratory provides a large suite of
        analyses for water and biological samples. Additional laboratories
        provide specialized services and analyses: Ohio District Microbiology
        Laboratory.

   TECHNIQUES Scientists and technicians of the USGS are active in the
   development, documentation, and implementation of field procedures,
   laboratory methods, and interpretive techniques for water-quality data.
