   Division of Developmental Disabilities

   Message from the Director: People with developmental disabilities and
   their families are valued citizens of the state of Washington. The
   Division of Developmental Disabilities strives to develop and implement
   public policies that will promote individual worth, self-respect, and
   dignity such that each individual is valued as a contributing member of
   their community.

   the community.

   The mission of the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) is to
   endeavor to make a positive difference in the lives of people eligible
   for services, through offering quality supports and services that are:
   individual/family driven; stable and flexible; satisfying to the person
   and their family; and able to meet individual needs. Supports and
   services shall be offered in ways that ensure people have the necessary
   information to make decisions about their options and provide optimum
   opportunities for success.

   These core values guide us in fulfilling our mission:

   Individual worth and development: People will be served with dignity
   and with respect for individual differences and be supported to
   experience: the benefits of relationships with friends and families;
   personal power and choice; personal value and positive recognition by
   self and others; integration; competence to manage daily activities and
   pursue personal goals; and health and safety.

   Continuity and coordination of services: Services will be provided in a
   flexible system, which enables people to remain in their own homes and
   communities wherever possible.

   Community participation and partnership: Services and supports will
   promote the participation and partnership of consumers, parents,
   service providers, advocates, local governments, citizens, and
   businesses.

   Respect for Employees: Employees are treated as the division's most
   valuable resource.

   Services quality and performance accountability: The division is
   accountable to the public for effective and prudent use of resources.
   The division will conduct regular review, evaluation and modifications
   of programs and services.

   Nondiscrimination: The division will not discriminate on the basis of
   gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, or
   sexual orientation/perceived sexual orientation in admission and access
   to services, treatment, or employment.
