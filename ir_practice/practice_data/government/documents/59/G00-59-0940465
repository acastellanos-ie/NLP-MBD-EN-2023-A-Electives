Status

   GOES-11 is in cold on-orbit storage at 104 W. It will be revived at
   least once per year for orbit adjustment until it is needed to replace
   GOES-EAST or GOES-WEST.

   Post-launch testing was more uneventful than any of the previous
   satellites in the series. There is at least 10 years worth of
   station-keeping fuel on board. There are no significant concerns with
   the instruments or spacecraft.

GOES-11 Status

On August 15, 2000, at approximately 06:16 Z, the GOES-11 spacecraft was
successfully placed in the Z-Axis Precession (ZAP) storage mode. Flight
data shows that the actual major axis and desired spin-up rates were
extremely close to those predicted. The initial maximum nutation cone was
approximately 2.5 degrees, indicating a good spin maneuver and an accurate
mass property prediction from the spacecraft manufacturer, SS/L. The
target angular velocity magnitude was 0.7 deg/sec and 0.698 deg/sec was
achieved.

Further analysis will reveal long term attitude and thermal stabilization
performance, but it is expected to be excellent. Ranging results show
that GOES-11 is now located at 104.2 deg W longitude with a West drift rate
of 0.01 deg/day. The GOES-11 orbit will turn around at 106.7 deg W
longitude in July 2001. The event marks the 7th ZAP storage maneuver for
the GOES constellation and a further validation of the robustness of the
storage mode design.

    ANOMALIES/CONCERNS

   1) Notch Filter 2 Occurred May 12.
   An upgrade to the attitude control software designed to minimize
   resonances between the spacecraft and solar panel did not work
   properly. (It will remain disabled until further notice)

   2) Sounder Filter Wheel Back-EMF anomaly occurred May 18.
   Sounder FW current and un-powered winding voltage showed YH TLM
   violation. Sounder FW current and voltage problems were corrected by
   cycling the Sounder electronics ON. Both current and voltage went back
   to the nominal values.

   3) AOCS FMT change anomaly occurred May 18.
   When commanded to switch to FMT 126, FMT 126 was not received. The
   problem was isolated to the Santiago ground network station and their
   operation method for energizing the 16 kHz sub-carrier just before a
   command up-link and dropping it immediately after the command is sent.

   4) Attitude Deviation on June 16.
   An attitude fluctuation of 0.01 degree was observed in yaw (east-west).
   The cause is not yet understood.

Spacecraft

   In mid-1998, the GOES-L spacecraft completed thermal-vac testing at
   Space Systems/Loral in Palo Alto, California. GOES-L was shipped to
   Cape Canaveral in mid-December 1998. There are no significant issues
   with the spacecraft and instruments, which were stored at the Cape for
   18 months.

Imager

   Imager SN06 was constructed and tested at ITT in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
   It was shipped to SS/L for integration onto the spacecraft in August
   1997.

Sounder

   Sounder SN06 has been constructed and tested at ITT in Fort Wayne,
   Indiana. It was shipped to SS/L for integration onto the spacecraft in
   August 1997.

Launch Saga

   After being assembled and tested during 1997-98, GOES-L was to be
   launched in the spring of 1999 and used to replace GOES-8 in 2000.

   The expected launch date was 15 March 1999, but then it was moved up to
   15 May 1999 to accomodate another launch.

   The expected launch date was then moved to 23 May 1999, due to concern
   about the second stage rocket.

   The GOES-L May launch was then put on hold throughout the summer of
   1999 due to a spate of rocket failures in similar second stage rockets.

   The rockets were cleared for use in August of 1999, and GOES-L was
   re-scheduled for mid-November 1999 and then mid-December 1999.

   The late 1999 launches which were both pre-empted by other launches.

   In January 2000, GOES-L was given a firm launch data of 3 May 2000.

   However, a Shuttle launch during the last week of April 2000 was
   delayed by weather. It could have pre-empted the GOES-L launch in the
   first week of May. Fortunately, GOES-L was given the green light on
   April 29th.

   Finally, GOES-L did launch sucessfully on 3 May 2000, at 3:07 am EDT,
   just 40 minutes after the planned launch time of 2:27 am.

   After about 3 months of post-launch checkout at 104W, NOAA put GOES-11
   into on-orbit cold storage in mid-August 2000.

   We hoped that NOAA would use GOES-L to perform continuous rapid scans
   of the south Atlantic and Caribbean during the Y2K hurricane season,
   before being turned off.
