   A drawing of a fictitious woman's face with the caption "Hi, I'm Edie!"
        The woman is waving hello. The name "Edie" is an acronym for
   "Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator." A drawing of Edie's face with
   various expressions, sometimes including hand gestures, is displayed at
     the upper left of every page on this website. Sometimes the drawing
       indicates the status of the page or the result of your entry of
   information into the web page. Sometimes the drawing is just a smiling
                      face that has no special meaning.
