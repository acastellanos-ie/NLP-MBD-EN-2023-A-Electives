     Geographic distribution of excess agricultiural nitrogen in the
     Mississippi River Basin
     Michael R. Burkart and David E. James

     This paper defines the distribution, by hydrologic unit, of major
     sources, dominant losses, and immobilized nitrogen attributible to
     agriculture.

     Agricultural Nitrogen Trends in the Mississippi Basin, 1949-1997
     Michael R. Burkart and David E James

     This paper provides an estimate of temporal trends and the
     geographic distribution of a variety of agricultural-nitrogen
     sources, losses, and immobilization.

     Plant-Soil-Microbe N Relationships in High Residue Management
     Systems
     Dana Dinnes

     Agriculture and Water Quality: A National Perspective
     Jerry L. Hatfield

     Emerging Challenges in Land Management: An American Perspective on
     Efficiency
     Jerry L. Hatfield
     Water Quality and Farming Practices in an Agricultural Watershed
     Jerry L. Hatfield, Daniel B. Jaynes, Michael R. Burkart, and M.A.
     Smith

     Regional Spatial Analysis using the National Resources Inventory
     David James, Michael Burkart, Mason J. Hewitt III

     This paper describes an analytical tool developed to allow people
     unfamiliar with ARC/INFO to explore the NRI. This paper was
     presented at the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)
     conference in May of 1995.

     (Requires Adobie Acrobat Reader) Management and Maintenance of
     Earthen Manure Structures: Implications and Opportunities for Water
     Quality Protection
     Tom L. Richard, Sandra Pollard, and Katundra Shears

     This study used a detailed on-site survey to observe actual
     operational practices and identify possible mechanisms for ground
     and surface water contamination at 33 earthen manure structures,
     including 19 storage basins, 13 anaerobic lagoons, and 1 aerobic
     lagoon.
     *This paper was not written by NSTL staff, but is part of a series
     of studies that is related to "Hydrogeologic Settings of Selected
     Earthen Waste Storage Structures...".

     Hydrogeologic Settings of Selected Earthen Waste Storage Structures
     Associated With Confined Animal Feeding Operations in Iowa
     William W. Simpkins, Michael R. Burkart, Martin F. Helmke, Trenton
     N. Twedt, David E. James, Robert J. Jaquis, Kevin J. Cole

     This is a report on the soils, geologic materials, aquifers, and
     hydrologic conditions surrounding 34 representative lagoons and
     basins in Iowa. Qualitative interretations are presented on the risk
     these sites pose to ground and surface water resources.
