   Special Programs
   Several of the Department's programs target specific veteran
   populations, and we hope you will take advantage of the resources they
   offer.

     * Disabled Veterans
       This page includes information on Web site accessibility, the
       President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities,
       and links to sites that deal address other accessibility issues.

     * Homeless Veterans
       The homeless program promotes the development and provision of
       housing and other supportive services. Homeless veterans achieve
       residential stability, increase their skill levels and/or income,
       and obtain greater self-determination.

     * Military Services
       Outreach to active duty service members and veterans is an integral
       part of the Veterans Benefits Administration. We provide
       information that will prove helpful to the separating service
       member as well as the veteran.

     * Minority Veterans
       The unique circumstances and special needs of minority veterans are
       addressed by the Center for Minority Veterans' staff.

     * Women Veterans
       The Center for Women Veterans ensures women veterans have access to
       VA benefits and services and that VA health care and benefits
       programs are responsive to the gender-specific needs of women
       veterans.
