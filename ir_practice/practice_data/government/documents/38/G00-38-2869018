   Aviation Update

   Friday,  November 9, 2001
   2 p.m. Eastern Time

   FAA Restores General Aviation in 12 More Major Metropolitan Areas

   On Oct. 21, the FAA announced that private aircraft may resume flying
   this week in the airspace around 12 major metropolitan areas, in
   addition to the 15 metropolitan areas announced last week. This week,
   flights under visual flight rules (VFR) may resume according to the
   following schedule:

   - Monday, October 22 at 7:00 a.m. eastern time:  Atlanta, GA; Las
   Vegas, NV; Los Angeles, CA: Miami, FL, and San Francisco, CA.
   - Tuesday, October 23 at 7:00 a.m. eastern time:  Denver, CO; Detroit,
   MI; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA, and San Diego, CA.
   - Wednesday, October 24 at 7:00 a.m. eastern time:  Chicago, IL and
   Orlando, FL.
   In keeping with procedures established last week, aircraft with
   encoding transponders will be able to fly VFR in the Enhanced Class B
   airspace around these areas. Pilots of aircraft with radio capability
   are instructed to monitor the guard frequency (121.5 MHz) while in
   Enhanced Class B airspace.  Aircraft without transponders will be able
   to fly in Enhanced Class B if pilots first obtain a waiver. Enhanced
   Class B airspace is at least a 20-nautical-mile (22.7 statute mile)
   radius around a major airport and extends from the ground to 18,000
   feet.
   Current restrictions on VFR flying in three other major metropolitan
   areas Boston, New York and Washington, DC remain unchanged.

   General Aviation Flights and NOTAMS

   Special interest NOTAMS - Notices to Airmen - issued since Sept. 11 are
   available online at www.faa.gov/NTAP/. This is a resource for pilots -
   especially general aviation pilots and operators. If you are a general
   aviation pilot and unsure of your authorization status, please contact
   your local Flight Service Station at 1-800-WXBRIEF. Pilots flying under
   visual flight rules must receive a full briefing from their Flight
   Service Station or DUATS.

   The FAA appreciates the patience and understanding of the general
   aviation community as the FAA works to restore the nation's aviation
   system after the devastating attacks of Sept. 11. The FAA is deeply
   concerned about the hardships caused by the current restrictions on VFR
   flights. These restrictions are being implemented due to high-level
   decisions based on security considerations.

   Administrator Jane Garvey Speaks About the New World of Aviation

   On October 17 in a speech to the National Press Club, FAA Administrator
   Jane Garvey spoke about the changes in civil aviation following
   September 11s terrorist attacks. She outlined the steps the FAA and the
   aviation community is taking to assure the safety and security of the
   U.S. aviation system. You may read the speech by following this link or
