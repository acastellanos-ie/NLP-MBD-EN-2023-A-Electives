      Frequently Asked Questions
        * Q: Does the Clean Cities Program provide funding to designated
          Clean Cities?
          A: No, not directly. The Clean Cities Program is not a grant or
          funding program. However, DOE does act as a clearinghouse for
          information on a variety of funding sources, and guides the award
          of federal funds and grantsas availabletoward Clean Cities.
        * Q: How can communities get information on funding?
          A: The Clean Cities Hotline (800-224-8437) is available to answer
          questions on various funding options. DOE has available the Clean
          Cities Guide to Alternative Fuel Vehicle Incentives and Laws, which
          includes information on the various types of funding used by and
          available for Clean Cities.

      Fleet Tools (Credits/Incentives)
        * Some fleets are eligible for credits or other incentives based on
          their type and location. The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's
          Guide helps fleet managers make informed AFV purchase decisions
          based on mandates, incentives, vehicle prices, refueling
          availability, etc.
        * The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Acquisition and Credits Database is
