   If you having problems with your case, CAP is designed to help you
       understand your rights and responsibilities and assist you in
       presenting your concerns to DOR.
       If you are dissatisfied with any action or decision of the
       Department, and have tried to work with your counselor and the
       counselor's supervisor, you should contact the Client Assistance
       Program (CAP).
       CAP advocates are not employees of the Department. They serve as
       independent advocates. If you cannot achieve resolution to your
       concerns at the local level, CAP may help you request and prepare
       for mediation, an Administrative Review or Fair Hearing. Advocates
       can help you with :

   Information about services available under the Rehabilitation Act.
       Assistance in negotiating mutually acceptable solutions to
       disagreements.
       Representation at administrative reviews and fair hearings. (The
       agencies holding the reviews and hearings must be funded by the
       Rehabilitation Act in order for this service to be provided).
       Post Appeal/Hearing Reviews upon request including assistance in
       obtaining legal counsel in some cases.
