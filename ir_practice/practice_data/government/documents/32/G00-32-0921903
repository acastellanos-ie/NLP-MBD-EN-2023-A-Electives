    Research Interests:

    My research interests are focused on developing and using X-ray
    crystallographic and other methods to investigate protein
    structure-function relationships in systems that are both intriguing
    from a scientific perspective, and of clear importance from a
    humanistic perspective. My current interests are:

   I) Methods in membrane-protein structure determination

   In a presentation to the Biology Working Group at the Workshop on
   Fourth Generation Light Sources held at Argonne National Laboratory on
   October 27-29, 1997, I proposed that it may be possible to determine
   structures of membrane proteins in 2-dimensional crystals by using hard
   X-ray from a Free Electron Laser, such as those planned for development
   at SSRL-SLAC and at DESY. I have since elaborated further on this
   proposal at several workshops and meetings, and I am pursuing
   feasibility and developmental studies, using current and evolving
   technologies, towards realizing this goal once useable X-ray FEL beams
   become available in the future. In addition to the aim of improving
   capabilities for integral-membrane protein structure determination,
   another motivation for this work is that a combination of data from
   these types of experiments with data from high-resolution electron
   crystallography on similar samples may lead to direct experimental
   determination of protein dielectric properties.

   I am also interested in developing novel expression systems to obtain
   integral-membrane proteins in high yield for crystallographic and other
   studies.

   II) Systems: Neurobiology, Malaria, Photosynthesis

   I have general and specific interests in the areas of neurobiology,
   malaria, and photosynthesis, involving both membrane proteins and
   water-soluble proteins.

   Beamline Responsibilities:

   [M_Becker_X25_icon.jpg] My principal responsibilities are to manage
   operations of the Macromolecular X-Ray Crystallography program at the
   NSLS wiggler Beamline X25. I share this responsibility with Lonny
   Berman of the NSLS, who is the spokesperson for the multidisciplinary
   program at X25.

   Finally, along with Lonny, I am organizing a workshop on Frontiers in
   Structural Biology at High-Brightness X-Ray Sources for the Annual NSLS
   Users Meeting on May 21-24, 2001.
