   Mission Statement

   The mission of Argonne National Laboratory's Emergency Preparedness
   group is to help increase the knowledge, skills and effectiveness of
   emergency managers, planners, and responders in the United States and
   overseas who are dealing with technological and natural disasters. Key
   goals are to help develop and improve capabilities for mitigating
   safety and heath impacts to those affected in communities affected by
   an emergency.

   consequence management and radiological assessment. It incorporates a
   variety of analytical tools and methods, such as
     * Exercise planning, evaluation, and review
     * Planning standards and criteria
     * Response planning models
     * Classroom and field training
     * Computer simulations
     * Guidance and policy manuals
