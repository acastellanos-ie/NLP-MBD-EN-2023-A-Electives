   Johanna Duncan-Poitier

   Johanna Duncan-Poitier is a leader with more than 25 years' experience
   in managing organizational change. Her focus has been on action to
   achieve results efficiently, creating linkages to maximize resources
   and increase coordination. As Deputy Commissioner for the Professions
   in the New York State Education Department, she oversees an office that
   protects the public by regulating practice in 38 professions licensed
   under Title VIII of the State Education Law (including the health,
   design and accounting professions). The Office licenses and registers
   over 600,000 professionals and thousands of professional corporations
   and pharmacies. It handles over 6,000 allegations of professional
   misconduct and illegal practice each year.

   Under her leadership, the Office of the Professions has been recognized
   as a national leader in professional regulation. The Office of the
   Professions became the first comprehensive licensing agency in the
   nation to place on the World Wide Web every professional's licensure
   and registration status and every final decision made since 1994 by the
   Board of Regents in professional discipline cases. As a result, the
   public has access to vital information about the professions on whom
   they rely. Ongoing efficiencies in the Office's processes include:
   reducing the time required to reregister licensed professionals from
   six weeks to one day; overhauling the entire license restoration
   process; and, in a recently enacted pilot project, reducing by 86% the
   average time required to settle a professional discipline case from the
   time the complaint is made. She continues to lead the Office of the
   Professions in improving efficiency and quality by streamlining its
   processes and incorporating appropriate technology. This is
   accomplished with the supportive partnership role of the 25 State
   boards and various professional organizations. Most recently, Johanna
   received the single Achievement Award for excellence in professional
   regulation from the National Council on Licensure, Enforcement and
   Regulation (CLEAR). Also, under her leadership, the Office of the
   Professions most recently received the Work Force Champions Award from
   the Governor's Office for its outstanding accomplishments.

   Before accepting her present post, Ms. Duncan-Poitier served as
   Assistant Commissioner for Workforce Preparation and Continuing
   Education. She led such initiatives as securing the largest Federal
   School-to-Work implementation grant awarded to any state in the nation;
   oversight of more than $250 million in federal and state resources;
   securing more than 5,000 employment opportunities; and directing
   Federal legislation activities for the 1992 Vocational Education Act
   amendments, which resulted in the reallocation of significant resources
   to employment initiatives with business, industry, and organized labor.
   Ms. Duncan-Poitier has received numerous other awards including the
   Jean Coon Memorial Award for Excellence in Management and citations for
   her dedication and service to the public and professional community.
   Her previous positions included the Director of Policy Development in
   the Office of Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals with
   Disabilities (VESID) and more than ten years in high-level leadership
   positions with the City University of New York.

   Ms. Duncan-Poitier earned a baccalaureate degree at Queens College; a
   Master's in Public Administration at Bernard M. Baruch College; and a
   Certificate in Advanced Management and Leadership Training at the
   National Center for Leadership, Atlanta University.
