                SNfactory Discovery and Follow-up Simulations

   [redshift_distrib.jpg] Here is shown the redshift distribution for Type
   Ia supernovae the SNfactory expects to find using the NEAT dataset. A
   limiting magnitude of B = 18.7 has been assumed. The central, solid
   curve corresponds to a "typical" Type Ia with stretch = 1. The other
   two curves correspond to the redshift distributions for the most
   overluminous and most unluminous Type Ia supernova. This redshift
   distribution results from an interplay between the increasing volume
   element at larger redshifts and the shortened time during which a
   rising supernova is above the detection threshold. The cut-off redshift
   corresponds to a Type Ia supernova at peak.
