   Model Clean Air Vehicle Ordinance
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Air District has adopted a Model Clean Air Vehicle Ordinance. This
   model ordinance is part of the Districts strategy to work with local
   governments to promote the use of advanced technology, clean air
   vehicles in the Bay Area. This page provides information regarding:

   Benefits of Clean Air Vehicles

   The Role of Local Agencies

   Summary of Model Clean Air Vehicle Ordinance

   Background:
   Motor vehicles emissions are the primary source of air pollution in the
   San Francisco Bay Area. Improved emission control devices and cleaner
   fuels have greatly reduced vehicle emissions on a per mile basis over
   the past twenty years. However, this progress has been offset, in part,
   by the tremendous growth in the total vehicle miles of travel in the
   region.

   In recent years there has been major progress in the development of low
   emission, alternative fuel vehicles, including electric and hybrid
   electric vehicles, natural gas vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. Much
   of this progress toward advanced technology vehicles has been spurred
   by the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate adopted by the California
   Air Resources Board (see www.zevinfo.com). The ZEV mandate requires
   automakers to produce electric vehicles, and other advanced technology
   clean air vehicles.

   Benefits: Alternative fuel, clean air vehicles offer many benefits.
   They improve air quality because they produce less tailpipe emissions
   and evaporative emissions, and reduce the emissions associated with
   petroleum refining and gasoline dispensing. They also help to reduce
   water and noise pollution, and CO2 emissions that contribute to global
   warming. Alternative fuel vehicle users typically experience lower
   maintenance and operating costs. And alternative fuel vehicles can be
   part of the long-term solution to our energy requirements by reducing
   our dependence on petroleum-based fuels.

   The Role of Local Agencies:  In the Bay Area, many local public agency
   fleets have been working to incorporate clean air vehicles in their
   fleets. The Air District has provided both funding and technical
   support to encourage these efforts. The Air District believes that
   cities, counties and other public agencies can play an important role
   in ensuring the successful introduction of electric vehicles and other
   clean air vehicles in their communities.

   In April 2001, the Air Districts Board of Directors approved a Model
   Clean Air Vehicle Ordinance. The model ordinance is intended to provide
   a comprehensive set of policies and actions that public agencies can
   implement to promote the use of electric vehicles (EVs) and other light
   duty clean air vehicles. The model ordinance contains provisions
   relating to:
    1. acquisition of clean air vehicles by public agency fleets,
    2. providing public-access electric vehicle (EV) charging stations,
    3. installing EV-ready wiring in new residential and commercial
       developments,
    4. enforcement of EV parking to discourage drivers of non-electric
       vehicles from using parking spaces reserved for electric vehicles

   The District also adopted a Model Clean Air Vehicle Acquisition Policy
   for special purpose agencies. The Policy is an abbreviated version of
   the model ordinance, and focuses on acquisition of clean air vehicles
   by agency fleets.


   The District encourages local governments to adopt the model ordinance.
   Adoption of the model ordinance is strictly voluntary on the part of
   local governments.

   Potential benefits to local agencies include:
     * Cleaner air for their citizens and workforce
     * Reduced vehicle operating costs
     * Greater diversity in energy sources

   Summary of Model Clean Air Vehicle Ordinance

   The model ordinance contains both "core provisions" and "optional
   provisions." Local agencies can select the provisions that are most
   relevant or feasible within their jurisdiction. They can also modify
   the specific language of the model ordinance to suit local needs and
   circumstances. A summary of proposed provisions is provided below.

   Core Provisions of Model Ordinance

   Create Clean Air Vehicle Program
   : Each local agency should create a Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) Program
   with a designated Program Manager who is responsible for developing and
   implementing a CAV acquisition plan for all departments; developing an
   electric vehicle infrastructure plan; and preparing an Annual Progress
   Report to the local governing board.

   Vehicle Applicability
   : The ordinance addresses light and medium duty vehicles (cars, pick-up
   trucks, and vans) with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 8,500 pounds or
   less. Emergency response vehicles (e.g. police, fire, paramedic) are
   exempt.

   Vehicle acquisition targets
   : The ordinance has two main provisions regarding procurement of clean
   air vehicles with a GVW of 8,500 pounds or less. Both provisions should
   be included in the local ordinance.


    1. Zero Emission Vehicles: The local ordinance should include specific
       numerical targets for acquisition of ZEVs. Attachment A of the
       model ordinance provides recommended targets for ZEV / PZEV
       acquisition based upon the CARB ZEV mandate. The recommended
       targets begin at 6% of new vehicles acquired during the 2003-2005
       period, using the vehicle credit factors provided in Attachment A
       of the model ordinance. Alternatively, the public agency may choose
       to develop its own numerical ZEV targets. This provision allows for
       multi-year averaging, at the discretion of the public agency, and
       also defines specific exemptions based upon cost of ZEVs or lack of
       available ZEV product.

     2) Clean Air Vehicles: The local ordinance should require that all
     new light duty vehicles of any fuel type procured by local agency
     achieve the either the ULEV, SULEV, or ZEV emission standard. Police
     and emergency response vehicles would be exempt. The Program Manager
     could grant exemptions to this provision when no ULEV, SULEV, or ZEV
     is available that meets the essential vehicle requirements or
     specifications.

   Provisions Re: Electric Vehicle Infrastructure:

   EV chargers at city facilities:
   Each local agency should develop a plan to install publicly-accessible
   EV charging stations at city-owned facilities, such as parking lots and
   garages, civic center complexes, convention centers, etc.

   EV ready wiring:
   The local agency should amend its building/planning codes to require
   that all new residential and commercial construction be equipped with
   EV-compatible wiring (220 volt, 40 amp conduit) and breakers in vehicle
   parking areas. Providing EV-ready conduit at the time of construction
   is a low-cost measure that will greatly reduce the cost to install EV
   charging equipment at a later date as demand warrants.

   EV chargers at major new development projects:
   The local agency should develop requirements for installation of
   publicly-accessible EV charging stations at major new development
   projects.

   EV Parking Enforcement
   : The local agency should amend its parking enforcement code to 1) levy
   fines for non-electric vehicles that park in EV charging spaces or
   other parking spaces specifically reserved for EVs, and 2) allow for
   towing of non-electric vehicles that are parked in EV charging spaces
   or otherwise blocking access to parking spaces equipped with EV
   chargers.

   Optional Provisions of Model Ordinance:

   Advisory Committee:
   Appoint a Clean Air Vehicle advisory committee to assist in
   development, implementation, and oversight of the local clean air
   vehicle program.

   Encourage ZEVs and Clean Air Vehicles in Private Fleets:
   The local jurisdiction could take measures to encourage private fleets
   to procure ZEVs and other clean air vehicles. In particular, the local
   agency could encourage or require clean air vehicles in fleets that
   operate under permit or contract to the local agency.

   EV parking:
   The local agency could conduct an inventory of parking areas and
   develop a plan to allow small electric vehicles ("city EVs" and
   "neighborhood EVs") to park in curb areas that are too small to
   accommodate regular size cars.

   Reduce required parking:
   The local agency could provide an incentive for developers to install
   EV charging equipment by agreeing to reduce the number of parking
   spaces required at new developments, if the developer agrees to install
   public-accessible electric vehicles chargers (or to install additional
   chargers over and above the number required by the local agency).

   Free parking for clean air vehicles
   : The local agency could allow clean air vehicles to park for free in
   metered spaces or other public parking lots or garages. [The easiest
   way to implement this would be to allow free parking for any vehicle
   equipped with the DMV decal that allows qualifying clean air vehicles
   (i.e. electric vehicles and natural gas vehicles) to use the HOV lane
   network on freeways.]
