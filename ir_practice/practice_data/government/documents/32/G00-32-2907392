                       Coal mining without reclamation

   Prior to passage of the Surface Mining Law in 1977, coal mining often
   left a barren, unreclaimed landscape such as this view in eastern
   Tennessee. Although significant improvements in reclamation have
   occurred, many people incorrectly envision today's surface coal mining
   as looking this way.

                        Current coal mine reclamation

   Reclamation at this 200-acre steep-slope contour mine in Eastern
   Kentucky exemplifies the intent of the Surface Mining Law. Initially
   the land was regraded, topsoil spread on the slopes, and grass planted.
   Today, native trees and shrubs cover the slopes and reforestation is
   quickly progressing.

                      Ponds created during reclamation

   Permanent impoundments included in the reclamation provide farmers with
   water for livestock and greatly add to the wildlife habitat. During
   mining this pond prevented off site pollution by catching
   sediment-laden water flowing from the mine site. With reclamation
   complete it now provides an aquatic habitat where none existed before
   mining.

                       Productive reclaimed mine site

   In 1990 the trees used for the National Christmas Pageant of Peace
   tree-lighting ceremony, on The Ellipse in Washington, D.C., were grown
   at this tree farm located on reclaimed mine land in Maryland. Following
   the month-long pageant, the trees were transplanted to permanent
   locations in parks throughout the Washington, D.C. area.

                          Western mine reclamation

   Mine reclamation at this large Montana coal mine includes planting
   native grasses, shrubs, and trees to return the land to its pre-mine
   rangeland condition. Here young trees grow on the reclaimed land that
   blends into the unmined adjacent forest.

                         Abandoned surface coal mine

   Before the Surface Mining Law was passed, mile upon mile of bare
   highwalls scarred the Appalachian skyline, as shown at this
   Pennsylvania abandoned mine site. Under the Law coal mines must be
   reclaimed so the land surface is back to its approximate original
   contour.

                      Wetlands at a reclaimed coal mine

   This Illinois abandoned mine site was often referred to as the nation's
   worst example of pre-Law acid soil and water problems associated with
   surface coal mining. The reclamation eliminated the sources of acid
   runoff and constructed a wetland over much of the 8,000 acre site.
   Today this is one of the best examples of wildlife development on
   surface-mined land.

                        Reclaimed abandoned coal mine

   Reclamation at this West Virginia abandoned mine site eliminated 6,000
   linear feet of highwall and sealed four mine openings. Today this
   landscape bears little resemblance to its appearance before the
   abandoned highwalls and spoil were reclaimed.
