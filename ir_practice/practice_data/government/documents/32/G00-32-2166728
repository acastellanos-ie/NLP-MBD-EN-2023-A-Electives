   About FOIA
   Provided by the Bureau of Administration (A/RPS/IPS)

Introduction to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Guide

   The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA)
   was signed into law on October 2, 1996. The amendments require agencies
   to prepare a guide for requesting access to information from the
   Department.  Consistent with these requirements, the Department has
   prepared this E-FOIA Guide. The E-FOIA Guide provides links to helpful
   reference guides and explains how you can obtain additional information
   from the Department.

1996 FOIA Highlights

   The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal statute. FOIA
   generally provides that any person has a right to request access to
   federal agency records, except to the extent the records are protected
   from disclosure by any of nine exemptions contained in the law or by
   one of three special law enforcement record exclusions. There are
   several point to keep in mind regarding the FOIA.

   Your request must be made in writing and you must provide a "reasonable
   description" of the records you are seeking.

   Agencies have 20 working days to provide an initial response.

   Agencies and requesters are encouraged to work together to define the
   scope of the request and the timing of the response.

   Agencies may establish "multi-track" response systems to facilitate the
   processing of simpler requests, rather than putting all requests in a
   single "queue."

FOIA Documents in the Electronic Reading Room

   The FOIA was recently amended by the Electronic Freedom of Information
   Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA). Among other things, E-FOIA grants the
   public access to government documents via computer telecommunications.
   The provisions of the FOIA, as amended by E-FOIA, can be found at 5
   U.S.C. 552.

   In response to the requirements of the FOIA, the Department has
   established a FOIA Electronic Reading Room on the Internet. Here are
   some important points to consider regarding the EFOIA:

   Not all documents released in response to a FOIA request are placed in
   the Electronic Reading Room, only those which are or  likely to become
   the subject of subsequent requests.

   The first documents made available will be those released since
   November 1, 1996. Documents of continuing public interest released
   before that date will be added over time.

   In general, the documents appear as they were released to the original
   requester. Where necessary, however, some information may have been
   withheld to prevent an unwarranted invasion of privacy. Such deletions
   are shown at the place on the document where the deletion has been
   made.

   If you cannot find the information you seek on this site, you may wish
   to file a FOIA request.

Making a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) Request

   These guidelines will help the Department of State respond to your
   request.

   FOIA requests must be made in writing. There are no special forms
   needed for making a request.

   You can mail or fax -- but not e-mail -- your request.

     Fax - (202)261-8590
     Address - Margaret P. Grafeld, Information & Privacy Coordinator
     Office of Information Resources Management Programs and Services,
     A/RPS/IPS, SA-2
     Department of State
     Washington, D.C.20522-6001
     Re: Freedom of Information Act Request

   Write "Freedom of Information Act Request" on the envelope or on the
   subject line of your fax.

   Include a daytime telephone number in case we need to contact you.

   To learn about Department of State records, go to:

     FAM (Foreign Affairs Manual)

     Department of State Records

     Government Information Locator Service (GILS)

     Government Printing Office's Privacy Act Issuances, 1995 Compilation

   Describe the records you are seeking as clearly and precisely as you
   can. If your request is vague or too broad, we may ask you to be more
   specific, and this can delay the processing of your request (See
   22CFR171.10(a))

   State your willingness to pay the applicable fees or provide a
   justification to support a fee waiver (See 22CFR171.15 and Fee
   Structure).

   For information about how the Department of State processes FOIA
   requests, refer to FAQs.

   To understand the scope of the law, refer to Text of the 1996 FOIA.

   To learn what types of records maintained by the Department of State
   may be exempted from disclosure under FOIA, go to 22 CFR 171, section
   171.11.
