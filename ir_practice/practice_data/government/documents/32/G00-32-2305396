  Preparing Children When Parents Deploy
   __________________________________________________________________

   Raising children has always been a difficult task. For families who are
   subject to assignment away from home, additional challenges exist.

   Even with military children who experience frequent relocation, the
   hardest thing that they must deal with is the deployment of their
   parents. Deployment to a location away from home results in a
   separation between service members and their loved ones. Having to tell
   a child that his or her parent is going away can be difficult. Adults
   should stress to children that:

     * They did nothing wrong. Children may think that their parent is
       leaving because of something that they did or did not do. It is
       important for children to understand that this is far from the
       truth. Children need to know that this is their parent's job.
       Firefighters fight fires and the military defends our country.
     * They are not alone. Assist children in finding a support group with
       other children who have parents deployed in the military. It may be
       helpful to children to know that others are experiencing what they
       are going through.
     * Their parent did not abandon them. It's important that children
       know that their parent did not just leave. Statements such as "your
       parent is on assignment" or "your parent is on the job or at work"
       are helpful to communicate to children that their parent did not
       desert them. Continuous communication is also vital to allay fears
       regarding abandonment.

   When a parent is deployed, it can be a stressful experience for
   children. It is important to maintain routine schedules and balance in
   children's everyday lives. Below are some tips to help children deal
   with the fact that their parent is away.

     * Get a calendar to note the days their parent will be gone. Be sure
       to inform children when their parent is coming back. If the
       parent's return will be delayed, tell the children as soon as you
       know.
     * Get a map to show children where their parent is. Do this even if
       their parent is close by. You can use different color flags to
       demonstrate where their parent has been and where he or she is now.
     * If possible, show children where their parent will be staying. If
       children can see where their parents will be sleeping, eating, and
       showering, it may ease their minds. Children may be very concerned
       thinking about how their parents go about their daily routines.

   Remember to take time for yourself. While children are in daycare,
   school, or visiting other relatives and friends, use the time wisely.
   Get some rest, read a book or enjoy a long, warm bath. A stressed out
   parent at home doesn't do children any good while their other parent is
   away.
