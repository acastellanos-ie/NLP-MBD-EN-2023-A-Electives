     On Armistice Day, November 11, 1930, the first patients arrived at
   the new Veterans Administration Hospital in Coatesville, PA. At the
   time of the official dedication, May 12, 1932, all but ten of the
   initial 480 beds were filled.
   Veterans Bureau Regional Director, Harry J. Crossan, and the Regional
   Bureau's Medical Officer had personally inspected 132 locations before
   the park-like, 368 acre Coatesville site was purchased in 1928. The
   deciding factor was the site's proximity to the main line of the
   Pennsylvania Railroad. Being close to the railroad allowed easy access
   for patients, visitors, and suppliers.
   During the medical center's early years, 250 acres were farmed by
   patients as part of their therapy program. In addition to vegetables
   and grain, approximately 350 hogs and 30 steers were raised each year.
   As years progressed and treatment changes occurred, the original farm
   operations were discontinued.
   The main building, Building No. 1, is a replica of Philadelphia's
   Independence Hall. It is situated on a hill 300 feet above Lincoln
   Highway. . . our nation's first transcontinental highway.
