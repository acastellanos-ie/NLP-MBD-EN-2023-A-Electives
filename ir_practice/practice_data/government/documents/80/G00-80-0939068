      Over its thirty five-year history, the Columbia Environmental Research
      Center (CERC) addressed contaminant research in support of sound
      natural resource management of the nation's aquatic and terrestrial
      ecosystems. As the Center grows and matures, the scope of its research
      programs broadened to an integrated approach for even more complex
      resource problems. These complexities encompass several factors
      associated with the biological significance of degraded water quality
      that often includes physical landscape alterations, invasive species,
      and ecosystem restoration activities. Today CERC conducts research in
      support of the Department of Interior agencies, but also works with
      other federal governmental agencies, state, tribal, private, and
      non-governmental organizations to meet common needs and goals.

   U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
       "Science for a Changing World"

           Created by an act of Congress in 1879, the USGS has evolved over
      the ensuing 120 years, matching its talent and knowledge to the
      progress of science and technology. Today, the USGS stands as the sole
      science agency for the Department of the Interior. It is sought out by
      thousands of partners and customers for its natural science expertise
      and its vast earth and biological data holdings. The USGS is the
      science provider of choice in accessing the information and
      understanding to help resolve complex natural resource problems across
      the Nation and around the world.

           The USGS serves the Nation as an independent fact-finding agency
      that collects, monitors, analyzes, and provides scientific
      understanding about natural resource conditions, issues, and problems.
      The value of the USGS to the Nation rests on its ability to carry out
      studies on a national scale and to sustain long-term monitoring and
      assessment of natural resources. Because it has no regulatory or
      management mandate, the USGS provides impartial science that serves the
      needs of our changing world. The diversity of scientific expertise
      enables the USGS to carry out large-scale, multi-disciplinary
      investigations that build the base of knowledge about the Earth. In
      turn, decision makers at all levels of government--and citizens in all
      walks of life--have the information tools they need to address pressing
      societal issues.
