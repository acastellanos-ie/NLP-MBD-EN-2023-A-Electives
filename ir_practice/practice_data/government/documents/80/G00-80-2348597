                          Neutron Stars and Pulsars

                                Neutron Stars

    Neutron stars are about 10 km in diameter and have the mass of about
    1.4 times that of our Sun. This means that a neutron star is so dense
    that on Earth, one teaspoonful would weigh a billion tons! Because of
     its small size and high density, a neutron star possesses a surface
           gravitational field about 300,000 times that of Earth.

   Neutron stars are one of the possible ends for a star. They result from
     massive stars which have mass greater than 4 to 8 times that of our
    sun. After these stars have finished burning their nuclear fuel, they
      undergo a supernova explosion. This explosion blows off the outer
   layers of a star into a beautiful supernova remnent. The central region
   of the star collapses under gravity. It collapses so much that protons
   and electrons combine to form neutrons. Hence the name "neutron star".

     Neutron stars may appear in supernova remnants or in x-ray binaries
       with a normal star. When a neutron star is in an x-ray binary,
    astronomers are able to measure its mass. From a number of such x-ray
     binaries, neutron stars have been found to have masses of about 1.4
      times the mass of the sun. Astronomers can often use this fact to
     determine whether an unknown object in an x-ray binary is a neutron
    star or a black hole, since black holes are more massive than neutron
                                   stars.

                  What is a Pulsar and What Makes it Pulse?

      Simply put, pulsars are rotating neutron stars. And pulsars pulse
                            because they rotate!

                             Diagram of a pulsar
              A diagram of a pulsar, showing its rotation axis
                            and its magnetic axis

    Pulsars were first discovered in late 1967 by Jocelyn Bell Burnell as
     radio sources that blink on and off at a constant frequency. Now we
   observe the brightest ones at almost every wavelength of light. Pulsars
    are spinning neutron stars that have jets of particles moving at the
      speed of light streaming out their two magnetic poles. These jets
    produce very powerful beams of light. For a similar reason that "true
    north" and "magnetic north" are different on Earth, the magnetic and
   rotational axes of a pulsar are also misaligned. Therefore, the beam of
     light from the jet sweeps around as the pulsar rotates, just as the
   spotlight in a lighthouse does. Like a ship in the ocean that sees only
    regular flashes of light, we see pulsars turn on and off as the beam
    sweeps over the Earth. Neutron stars for which we see such pulses are
                              called "pulsars".

                        X-ray Observations of Pulsars

    Some pulsars also emit X-rays. In pulsars which are part of supernova
     remnants, the x-rays result from the jets of material streaming out
   along the magnetic field of the pulsar. For pulsars in x-ray binaries,
    the x-rays are due to material from the companion star streaming down
                             the magnetic poles.

      Below, we see the famous Crab Nebula, an undisputed example of a
   neutron star formed during a supernova explosion. The supernova itself
     was observed in 1054 A.D. These images are from the Einstein X-ray
       observatory. They show the diffuse emission of the Crab Nebula
    surrounding the bright pulsar in both the "on" and "off" states, i.e.
     when the magnetic pole is "in" and "out" of the line-of-sight from
                                   Earth.
