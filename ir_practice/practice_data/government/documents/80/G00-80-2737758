   New Bulletin Issued on Traffic Roundabouts photo of a traffic

   A growing trend in roadway design favors modern roundabouts over
   traditional signalized intersections. While their design varies widely,
   roundabouts feature a circulatory roadway around a central island.
   Entering traffic yields to vehicles already in the circle. Increasingly
   popular in the U.S. because they add vehicle capacity and reduce severe
   vehicular crashes, roundabouts are a common feature in Europe and
   Australia. There is little research about pedestrian safety at
   roundabouts and virtually none about pedestrians who have vision
   impairments.

   Because crossing at a roundabout requires a pedestrian to visually
   select a safe gap between cars that may not stop, accessibility for
   people with vision impairments has been problematic. A new bulletin
   issued by the Board provides guidance on access to roundabouts for
   pedestrians with visual impairments.  This guidance is based on an
   analysis of the problem and on research  sponsored in part by the Board
   at the Department of Blind Rehabilitation at Western Michigan
   University.  The bulletin examines the current state of knowledge in
   regard to the accessibility of roundabouts to pedestrians with vision
   impairments. It also provides information for transportation planners
   and engineers who wish to improve the accessibility of modern
   roundabouts for all users. The bulletin addresses such topics as
   locating sidewalks, non-visual gap detection, roadway design, driver
   behavior, and the provision of detectable warnings.  The Board will use
   this information in developing proposed guidelines on accessible public
   rights-of-way.
