               System Intrusion & Network Attack Response Team

   The System Intrusion & Network Attack Response Team, or SINART, is a
   co-operative initiative between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and
   the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).  Working
   closely with the IRS and their Computer Security  Incident Response
   Center (CSIRC), SINART's mission is to promote the security and
   integrity of all computer systems located within the IRS by providing
   both technical and investigative support.  Approximately two thirds of
   the staff within SINART are Special Agents; the remaining staff
   consists of computer specialists and analysts.

   As a Federal law enforcement agency, our primary mission is to
   investigate crimes committed against the IRS.  However, a significant
   portion of our time is spent conducting proactive computer security
   reviews and network vulnerability assessments.  We also have an active
   research and development effort designed to assess new and emerging
   technologies related to the computer security field and actively
   disseminate this information throughout the computer security
   community.  It has always been our policy to provide expertise and
   resources to other Federal agencies when needed.

   The headquarters for SINART is located in the New Carrollton Federal
   Building in Lanham, Maryland.  For additional information, please
   contact Special Agent Andrew Fried (PGP key).
