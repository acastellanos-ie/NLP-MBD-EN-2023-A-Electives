                   Routine United States Mining Seismicity

   The catalog, "Routine Mining Seismicity in the United States", provides
   listings of routine explosions and planned roof collapses at mines and
   quarries in the United States. For the period May 1997 through March
   2000 the catalog was called "Probable Mining Explosions in the United
   States". In GOAL AND SCOPE OF THE CATALOG, we explain the seismological
   context in which the routine explosions and collapses are recorded and
   their locations calculated: we discuss uncertainties in the magnitudes
   of the cataloged seismic events and variations in the completeness of
   the catalog. In EVIDENCE USED IN IDENTIFYING ROUTINE MINING SEISMICITY,
   we explain the evidence that is used to identify routine explosions or
   planned collapses, and we note that in some areas a few natural
   earthquakes or unplanned rockbursts may be listed in the catalogs of
   routine mining seismicity. EXPLANATION OF CATALOG LISTINGS explains the
   parameters listed in "Routine Mining Seismicity in the United States".
   MINING SEISMICITY SOURCE REGIONS summarizes what we know about mining
   districts from which we have recorded explosions, planned collapses,
   and rockbursts. Funds for the development of this catalog were provided
   by the Verification and Compliance Division of the United States Arms
   Control and Disarmament Agency. Funds for the ongoing cataloging of
   mining seismicity and improvements to the cataloging process are
   provided by the U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction
   Agency.

   Catalogs

   For the period May - September, 1997, catalogs list epicenters for all
   mining-associated seismic events for which we had sufficient data to
   obtain a stable location.

     May, 1997 |June, 1997 | July, 1997 | August, 1997 | September, 1997

   For October - November, 1997, catalogs list principally events for
   which computed magnitudes are 2.0 or higher and for which stable
   calculations of the epicenters can be achieved in several computation
   attempts.

     October, 1997 | November, 1997

   For December, 1997 - April, 1998, we suspended the cataloging of
   mining-associated seismic events except for a few events of special
   interest.

     December, 1997 | January, 1998 | February, 1998 | March, 1998 |
     April, 1998

   May-July, 1998, was a training period for a new analyst ; cataloged
   events were selected for their usefulness in training, rather than
   according to a magnitude criterion.

     May, 1998 | June, 1998 | July, 1998 |

   From August, 1998, to June, 1999, and from October, 1999 to the
   present, mining associated seismic events having magnitude (ML, USGS)
   2.5 or greater in the western U.S., or having magnitude (mbLg, USGS)
   3.0 or greater in the eastern U.S., are listed if they are
   automatically detected and located by the USGS/NEIC near-real time
   system and if, after examination of the data by the analyst, a stable
   epicenter can be computed. In addition, smaller events are catalogued
   if, (1), they provide information on the characteristics of a region's
   mine-associated seismicity that cannot be obtained with the larger
   explosions or, (2), their epicenters have been reliably determined in
   the course of searching for larger events. For the period July --
   September, 1999, we list only suspected explosions that have been
   reported in the Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB) of the Prototype
   International Data Center (PIDC).

    More data on events listed in catalogs of "Routine Mining Seismicity in the
    United States"

   Additional data are available by anonymous ftp
   (ftp://ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/mineblast/). Bulletins that contain phase
   arrival-times used to compute mine-event epicenters have the form
   "mchedrYYMMex.dat". A catalog of the routine mining seismicity in
   GSE2.0 format is given as "mineevents.gct". These additional data are
   typically made available within one and two months of the date of the
   event.

    Mining-induced seismicity listed in the "Preliminary Determination of
    Epicenters" publications of the USGS/NEIC

   Unusually large mining-induced events that are listed in regular
   earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC are not listed in the catalogs of
   "Routine Mining Seismicity in the United States."
