   OBJECTIVES:
   Increase the accuracy and efficiency of balancing the SOFIA telescope:

   The Smart Systems Research Lab at NASA Ames Research Center is
   developing innovative methodologies and advanced software tools for
   balancing the SOFIA telescope precisely and efficiently.

   Balancing the Kuiper telescope (SOFIA's predecessor) was a very
   difficult and challenging task. Balancing the SOFIA telescope will be
   even more problematic because of its larger size. What is needed are
   technologies that will enable 1) rapid pre-flight telescope balancing,
   and 2) real-time in-flight dynamic telescope balancing. During flight,
   nonlinear effects such as cryogenic boil-off, varying forces from
   tethered data and power cables, and varying aerodynamics loads will
   affect telescope-pointing performance if left unabated.

   We have successfully developed an innovative pre-flight telescope
   balancing methodology that can rapidly and accurately balance a
   prototype telescope to within a mass of ~5 grams at a radius of one
   meter from the center of the spherical bearing when an unknown
   imbalance weight is placed in it. The prototype telescope is a 1/2
   scale model of the Kuiper telescope. The prototype telescope's
   spherical bearing provides a high fidelity simulation of the
   performance of the Kuiper telescope's spherical air bearing. This
   technology will enable pre-flight balancing of the SOFIA telescope to
   be performed accurately and rapidly.

   Development of in-flight dynamic balancing technologies for the SOFIA
   telescope is currently on hold, pending funding support.
