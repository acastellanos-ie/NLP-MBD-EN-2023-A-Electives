   Independent Contractor Reporting
   Printer Friendly Version

   Effective January 1, 2001, any business or government entity that is
   required to file a federal Form 1099-MISC for services received from an
   independent contractor is required to report specific independent
   contractor information to EDD. This information will be used to locate
   parents who are delinquent in their child support obligations.

   The new reporting requirements apply if you hire an independent
   contractor and:
     * You are required to file a 1099-MISC form for the services
       performed by the independent contractor, and
     * You pay the independent contractor $600 or more OR enter into a
       contract for $600 or more, and
     * The independent contractor is an individual or sole proprietorship.

   If all three of the above statements apply, you must report the
   independent contractor to EDD. You are not required to report
   independent contractors that are corporations, general partnerships,
   limited liability partnerships, and limited liability companies.
