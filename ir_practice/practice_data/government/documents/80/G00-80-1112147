   President, Mr. Vice President, and Mr. Speaker: I am pleased to forward
   to you A Comprehensive Assessment of Public Information Dissemination.
   This report was requested by Senator John McCain, Chair, Senate
   Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and Senator Joseph
   Lieberman, Ranking Democrat, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.
   This report was prepared by the United States National Commission on
   Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS). The Commission is an
   independent agency, established in 1970 by Public Law 91- 345 to take a
   leadership position on matters pertaining to the library and
   information needs of the American people. Specifically, the law calls
   for the Commission to "advise the President and the Congress on the
   implementation of national policy by such statements, presentations and
   reports as it deems necessary." How the federal government manages its
   information resources is a complex matter and the emergence of new
   electronic technologies only makes the matter more complex. The results
   of earlier efforts to shape policy in this area have been mixed.
   Certainly, laws enacted in the past three decades, such as the Privacy
   Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act,
   have established an overall framework that acknowledges the importance
   of information held by the federal government. On the other hand,
   efforts to modify laws affecting government printing have not met with
   success, and policies addressing permanent public availability of the
   burgeoning amounts of government information made available primarily
   (or exclusively) by way of agency websites have not kept pace with
   technological developments. In this report the Commission calls for a
   strong statement that recognizes government information as a strategic
   national resource with an importance similar to that accorded to land,
   labor and capital. It proposes an organizational structure that
   consolidates some existing government information activities. It calls
   for explicit funding for information activities, including creation,
   dissemination and permanent preservation. The findings, conclusions,
   and recommendations in this report provide a roadmap for reform. Reform
   is never easy; proponents of the status quo will always portray the
   outcome of change in the direst of terms. Nevertheless, the Commission
   has devoted a great deal of energy to examining these issues and it
   believes that the recommendations in this report are the right steps to
   take to bring needed reform. Of course, in many ways, the Commission is
   a champion of the status quo. We believe in the uniquely American
   approach that says that government of, by and for the people creates
   information that belongs to all the people. This approach is a jewel of
   our liberty. We believe, however, that there are also problems
   regarding government information and that technological developments
   exacerbate these problems. This report sets forth the ways in which
   these problems can be resolved. We know that there will not be
   universal support for every idea put forward. We are confident,
   however, that the ideas we present herein will form the basis for
   meaningful discussion that will culminate in reform to benefit all
   Americans. As always, the Commission stands ready to assist in any way
   we can be helpful. Respectfully, Martha B. Gould Chairperson A

   Information Dissemination ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The Commission is indebted
   to many individuals and groups for the extraordinary contributions made
   in helping plan and executive this very ambitious and complex study. We
   apologize to anyone whom we may have inadvertently overlooked or
   credited improperly for their efforts on our behalf. First and
   foremost, the Commission owes a large debt of gratitude to the four
   panel chairs, and their respective panel members, who took on a very
   big task at a time with a very short deadline at a time when all of
   them had many other priorities to deal with. The four panel chairs are:
   * Peter Urbach, who chaired Panel One effort dealing with recommended
   reforms of the NTIS business model. Now retired, his many-faceted
   contributions to the library and information profession, in both the
   public and private sectors, gave him authoritative insights based on
   sound experience which both his panel members and the Commission valued
   highly. * Kurt Molholm, who chaired Panel Two addressing steps to
   strengthen agency sharing of information to both help achieve their own
   missions more effectively as well as to help their agencies serve their
   own constituencies and clienteles more effectively. He took time out
   from an extremely busy schedule in managing the Defense Technical
   Information Center and serving as chairman of CENDI, the consortium of
   scientific and technical information intensive agencies. * Miriam
   Drake, who chaired Panel Three reviewing actions to improve how the
   government disseminates its information to external groups, including
   private citizens, corporations, depository libraries, lower levels of
   government, academia, research institutions, and others. She brought to
   bear her experience as dean of libraries for Georgia Institute of
   Technology as well as a lifetime of leadership in the library and
   information communities, including the presidency of the Special
   Libraries Association, service on the Depository Library Council, and
   many key private sector assignments. * Wayne Kelley, who chaired Panel
   Four, reviewing how the public and private sectors could continue and
   improve their respective roles in the efficient and effective
   dissemination of government information. Although now retired, he has
   held key positions in both the public and private sectors, including a
   tour as the Superintendent of Documents in the Government Printing
   Office. The Panel Members who participated actively in their respective
   forums included the following: * Panel One Members: Ken Allen, Steve
   Arnold, Ernest (Gill) Baldwin, Mel Day, Mike Majcher. Steve Needle,
   Kent Smith, Tim Sprehe, Kendall Wiggin, and Jay Young. * Panel Two
   Members: Jay Alden, Owen Ambur, Jonda Byrd, Bonnie Carroll, Bruce Cox,
   Blane Dessy, T. C. Evans, Walter Finch, Patrice McDermott, Ray Mosley,
   Al Pesachowitz, George J. Roncaglia, John A. Shuler, Kent Smith, J.
   Timothy Sprehe, Susan Tarr, and Walter Warnick. * Panel Three Members:
   Prudence Adler, Reva Basch, Lewis Bellardo, Kevin Donovan, Sharon
   Hogan, Brewster Kahle, Barbie Keiser, Diane Kresh, Bernie Margolis, Jim
   McGinty, Barbara Peterson, Barbara Quint, Dale Stanley, Rick
   Weingarten, Freida Weise, and Gladys Ann Wells. v U.S. National
   Commission on Libraries and Information Science * Panel Four Members:
   Mary Alice Baish, Francis Buckley, Anne Caputo, Blane Dessy, Dan
   Duncan, Wally Finch, Neal Gregory, Donald Hagen, Richard Kaser, Nancy
   Kranich, David LeDuc, Edwin Levine, Eric Massant, Peyton Neal, James
   Nelson, Molly Raphael, Franklin Reeder, and Roxanne Williams. Next, the
   Commission wishes to give a special thanks to our fourteen experts:
   Christopher Burns, Edward A. Fox, Robert M. Hayes, Donald Langenberg,
   Stuart Lynn, Deanna Marcum, Raymond T. Nimmer, Henry Perritt, Ron
   Plesser, William H. Price, Carol Risher, Thomas Susman, Paul Uhlir, and
   Paul Zurkowski. These individuals are among the Nation's most
   distinguished leaders in their respective fields, including information
   law, information economics, public policy, publishing, information
   science and technology, librarianship, the pure sciences, the applied
   sciences, the humanities, and other fields. They reviewed the Panel
   reports and the Commission's final report to ensure that "technical"
   aspects of the Commission's findings, conclusions, and recommendations
   were sound, feasible, and practical. We are grateful that these
   individuals took time out from their very busy schedules to share their
   expertise with the Commission. We also acknowledge the many individuals
   who called the Commission's attention to prior studies, relevant
   articles in the literature, websites containing important information,
   and other resources, the existence of which might not otherwise have
   been known to study participants. There were almost too many volunteers
   who assisted the Commission in various aspects of its deliberations.
   Among those who made special contributions were Maggie Hansen and Blane
   Dessey at the Department of Justice Library. A number of individuals
   and organizations, including Christopher Burns and Lexis-Nexis, kindly
   granted the Commission copyright permission, and/or waived fees, in
   order for us to utilize their materials, including published articles
   and database materials, for purposes of the study. We appreciate these
   kindnesses. To the many stakeholder groups that participated in the
   study, we must also express a debt of gratitude since their
   participation helped to ensure that the Commission heard from all of
   the voices that needed to be heard. We are grateful for the thoughtful
   comments and participation of the library and information associations
   and societies, associations whose members comprised disabled,
   disadvantaged and special-needs populations, the public interest
   groups, the trade and industry groups, labor unions, universities and
   research institutions, federal interagency committees, practicing
   library and information professionals, and last but not least the
   federal agencies themselves, which participated in many ways, including
   responding to a Commission survey. While most study participants were
   in the United States, a few foreign individuals tracked the study's
   developments and made contributions as well. Finally, a special
   acknowledgement must be made of the contributions of NCLIS consultants
   F. Woody Horton and Sarah T. Kadec who were the co-coordinators of the
   assessment, and NCLIS Deputy Director, Judith C. Russell. Their
   expertise and hard work contributed beyond measure to the success of
   this endeavor. vi A Comprehensive Assessment of Public Information

   xii A Comprehensive Assessment of Public Information Dissemination
   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY It was a simple announcement on a summer day. It
   appeared to be a straightforward proposal to solve a serious problem.
   Constrained by a statutory requirement for self-funding and facing a
   new paradigm in information dissemination, the National Technical
   Information Service (NTIS) was failing. As federal agencies distributed
   reports at no cost on the World Wide Web-reports that formerly NTIS had
   distributed-NTIS was unable to collect revenue sufficient to cover its
   costs of cataloging and maintaining its collection. The proposal put
   forth in August 1999 by the Department of Commerce (where NTIS is
   organizationally located) was to close NTIS and move its collections
   and functions to the Library of Congress.1 The National Commission on
   Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) immediately recognized this
   proposal to be far more significant than it first appeared. Fundamental
   issues regarding how the government used, disseminated and valued its
   information resources were at stake. The Commission stepped forward and
   prepared a preliminary assessment of the proposed closure of NTIS,
   which it delivered to the President and Congress.2 This report
   recommended a number of steps to keep NTIS operational, but it also
   stated that a much broader assessment of the underlying issues involved
   in public information dissemination throughout government was needed. A
   number of Congressional leaders in both the House of Representatives
   and the Senate urged NCLIS to prepare such a report; Senator John
   McCain, Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and
   Transportation, and Senator Joseph Lieberman, Ranking Democrat on the
   Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, both sent letters to the
   Commission formally requesting a review of reforms needed for the
   federal government's public information dissemination practices. This
   report is the response to those requests. A. THE ROLE OF NCLIS The
   National Commission on Libraries and Information Science is an
   independent agency in the Executive Branch, created by law (Public Law
   91-345, 20 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) in 1970. Its statute calls for it to
   "advise the President and the Congress on the implementation of
   national policy" pertaining to the library and information needs of the
   people of the United States. Throughout its history, NCLIS has
   addressed government information issues. In 1998, at the request of the
   Government Printing Office (GPO), the Commission surveyed federal
   agencies to understand 1 U.S. Department of Commerce, "Commerce

   Preliminary Assessment of the Proposed Closure of the National
   Technical Information Service (NTIS): A Report to the President and the
   Congress, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, March 16,
   2000; http://www.nclis.gov/govt/ntis/presiden.pdf. xiii U.S. National
   Commission on Libraries and Information Science how the formats,
   mediums and standards these agencies employed were significantly
   changing as they moved from an era in which most government information
   took the form of ink-on-paper to a time when electronic information
   technology is increasingly used.3 When NCLIS received the requests from
   Senators McCain and Lieberman to perform a comprehensive assessment of
   public information dissemination, it started a number of actions. A
   study plan outline was produced and published. Individuals were
   recruited to form four study panels addressing focused aspects of the
   issue (the NTIS business model; federal agency needs for central
   information services; public needs for government information, and;
   partnerships between the public and private sectors for public
   information dissemination); each panel submitted a report on its topic.
   A group of experts was assembled; many of these individuals prepared
   White Papers in their subject specialty and each reviewed various
   documents as the project progressed. A number of past reports dealing
   with government information were reviewed and many were made available
   to the panel members, experts and interested members of the public. A
   web site devoted to the project was created as part of the NCLIS web
   site and numerous drafts and documents were made available
   electronically through that means.4 The Commission met to review the
   findings, conclusions and recommendations that would comprise the
   assessment report. A public meeting, announced beforehand in the
   Federal Register, provided a members of the public and interest groups
   the opportunity to ask questions and state concerns regarding the NCLIS
   effort. The Commission provided a draft copy of the report to the
   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and OMB further distributed the
   draft to other agencies. Throughout this process, NCLIS received
   statements in support of some findings, conclusions and recommendations
   and others in opposition. The Commission benefited greatly from the
   many comments received throughout the project and incorporated many,
   but not all, of the suggestions received. Nevertheless, this report
   represents the opinions and recommendations of the Commission, not of
   the current or former Administration or any of the stakeholders who
   participated in its development. B. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Based on
   both its historical efforts and the extensive recent activities, the
   Commission confidently set forth a large number of findings and
   conclusions that describe the current state of government information.
   These observations are explained in detail in the full body of the
   report5 and are summarized below. Public ownership of information
   created by the federal government is an essential right. It not only
   allows individuals to fulfill their civic responsibilities, but also
   contributes to an overall improvement in their quality of life. Current
   information technology not only brings with it expanded opportunities
   for using government information but also a number of difficulties,
   including adequacy of finding tools, technological incompatibilities,
   and sometimes just the overwhelming amount of information. 3 Westat,

   http://www.nclis.gov/govt/assess/assess.vol4.pdf, respectively. xiv A
   Comprehensive Assessment of Public Information Dissemination Government
   agencies are trying to use the World Wide Web to ensure availability of
   information, and emerging efforts in development of indexing tools and
   web portals offer some hope. However, not all needed information is
   available on the Internet nor do users of public information
   necessarily have the professional skills to use what is available in
   any format. Also, government information made available electronically
   can disappear as quickly as it has appeared. No policy is in place for
   long term or permanent public access to web-based public information.
   Special populations, especially individuals with disabilities, but also
   those who, for whatever reason, find it difficult to use computers and
   computer networks, exist throughout the nation. Such populations
   clearly can benefit from information technology but special efforts
   need to be taken to guarantee the availability to them of appropriate
   information technology and government information content. The federal
   government has a critical role in formulating and overseeing public
   information dissemination policy. Hundreds of laws establish the
   requirement and authority of agencies to disseminate public
   information, but there is little distinction made between "passive
   dissemination" and "proactive dissemination." Moreover, the authority
   of agencies differs widely in terms of how broadly they are permitted
   to disseminate information to the public. It is evident that there are
   costs involved in managing and disseminating public information
   resources, but the manner of paying these costs is inconsistent and, at
   times, invisible across government. There are existing central service
   agencies, such as GPO, NTIS and the National Archives and Records
   Administration (NARA), who, in partnership with individual agencies,
   play a crucial role in information dissemination. However, there is no
   effective enforcement mechanism to use when these partnerships fail.
   There will always remain a strong need for central information service
   agencies, but these agencies need new business models that reflect the
   realities of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Overlap and
   competition among these agencies is unnecessary and wasteful. There are
   efforts to improve coordination-for example, through interagency
   committees-and these efforts should be continued and strengthened.
   Everything that has been learned about problems and opportunities
   affecting federal government information is likely to apply to public
   information at the state and local government levels. Such information
   is just as important to the people as is federal government
   information. However, the inconsistencies and incompatibilities among
   programs at the different levels of government need to be eliminated.
   The private sector plays a key role in further distributing public
   information and enhancing its value. This group consists of commercial
   firms as well as a host of libraries and not-for-profit organizations.
   Both the for-profit and the not-for-profit sectors need to strengthen
   their partnership arrangements with government. The approach the United
   States takes with regard to public information is a source of great
   strength and the approach should be widely promoted to all nations
   around the world. C. RECOMMENDATIONS Based on the findings and
   conclusions, the Commission is setting forth thirty-six
   recommendations. These recommendations are stated more fully and
   discussed in the main body of the report. The list that follows is
   intentionally designed to be a shorthand reference and certainly does
   not capture the subtlety or complexity that the full recommendation
   contains. xv U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information

   by which agencies classify records prior to archival retention or
   disposal. 29. Partner broadly, in and outside government, to ensure
   permanent public availability of public information resources. 30.
   Identify the public's most critical unmet requirements for public
   information resources. 31. Identify the federal government's most
   critical requirement for technologies to manage public information
   resources. 32. Involve the Office of Science and Technology Policy in
   the effective management of scientific and technical information. 33.
   Monitor cooperation between PIRA and the National Archives and Records
   Administration. 34. Require that data elements set forth in the
   Government Paperwork Elimination Act be reported in XML, and review the
   impact of this requirement regularly. 35. Ensure the availability of a
   trained federal workforce with skills in Internet Age technologies. 36.
   Advance the recommendations of this Assessment report to other nations
   worldwide. It should be emphasized that the foregoing recommendations
   are just that, recommendations. The Commission believes that
   implementation of these recommendations will vastly improve the
   condition of government information dissemination in the United States,
   but it also recognizes that others have different views. It is up to
   the President and Congress, as the recipients of this report, to
   determine whether and to what extent these recommendations should be
   implemented. The Commission stands ready to fulfill its statutory
   obligation to provide advice to the President and Congress in whatever
   way may be helpful. xvii U.S. National Commission on Libraries and
   Information Science xviii A Comprehensive Assessment of Public
   Information Dissemination VOLUME 1. A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF
   PUBLIC INFORMATION DISSEMINATION A. THE ROLE OF NCLIS The United States
   National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) is an
   independent agency charged by its enabling legislation (Public Law
   91-345) to take a leadership position on matters pertaining to the
   library and information needs of the nation. Specifically, 20 U.S.C.
   1504(a)(1) says that the Commission shall "advise the President and the
   Congress on the implementation of national policy by such statements,
   presentations, and reports as it deems appropriate." In fulfillment of
   that statutory mandate, the Commission throughout its 30-year history
   has had an abiding interest and concern for studying ways the
   government can improve its public information dissemination practices.
   However, in the last three years, largely because of the intensified
   interest in the federal government's use of the World Wide Web and the
   Internet as the preferred medium for distributing public information to
   citizens and other elements of society, the Commission has focused
   squarely in three closely related studies, conducted sequentially, on
   policy, management, standards, accessibility, and other major issues
   and concerns that have arisen as a result of this shift in access and
   delivery channels from pre-Internet modes such as ink-on-paper,
   microfiche, and CD-ROM or DVD, to World Wide Web and Internet modes.
   Four years ago, in 1996, the Government Printing Office was asked by
   the Congress to investigate the increasing proliferation of formats,
   mediums, platforms, and protocols being utilized by federal agencies to
   disseminate public information products. The GPO turned to NCLIS to
   assist in undertaking the task. NCLIS engaged Westat, Inc., a survey
   research firm, to survey a sample of over 300 products in a cross
   section of 24 different agencies in all three branches. A final report
   was published on this first of the three studies on March 30, 1999.6
   Then in August 1999, after consulting with Department of Commerce
   officials and members of both the Senate and House Committees holding
   jurisdiction over science and technology issues, and very soon after
   the announcement by Commerce of it intention to close the National
   Technical Information Service (NTIS) and shift its paper, microfiche,
   digital archives, and bibliographic database to the Library of
   Congress, the Commission launched a second major study, this time
   focused primarily on NTIS. A final report on this second of the three
   studies was published in March 2000.7 In both the 1996 GPO-requested
   study, and the follow-on 1999 NTIS study, the Commission observed that
   both the issues and concerns surrounding the proliferation of
   electronic formats for disseminating 6 Westat, Inc., Report on the

   http://www.nclis.gov/govt/ntis/presiden.pdf. 1-1 U.S. National
   Commission on Libraries and Information Science government information
   to the public, and the issues and concerns surrounding the proposed
   transfer of the functions, programs, and resources of NTIS to the
   Library of Congress, should not be viewed as isolated events. Rather,
   the Commission concluded that those issues were both a part of the
   broader fabric of an even larger question-how the government should
   reform its laws, policies, programs, and practices for disseminating
   information to the public in the Internet Age. The Commission therefore
   enthusiastically welcomed the requests by both Senator John McCain and
   Senator Joseph Lieberman to undertake this broader study. Readers
   should keep this larger context in mind in reviewing the findings and
   recommendations contained herein, as well as the admonition of the
   Congressional committees requesting the study that the final report
   should represent an NCLIS position, developed as a result of its
   statutory mandates, findings from earlier studies, and independently
   gathered facts and opinions. NCLIS was specifically directed in its
   discussions with Congressional staff neither to attempt to necessarily
   seek a consensus on every recommendation, nor to "pull punches" simply
   because a recommendation might appear to be politically difficult.
   Therefore, this report represents the opinions and recommendations of
   the Commission in its statutory role as an advisor to the Congress.
   This report, including its legislative recommendations, reflects only
   the views of the Commission. The report does not necessarily reflect
   the views of the current, or former, Administration or any other
   agency. Because the report's legislative recommendations address the
   activities and authority of agencies throughout the Executive Branch
   and it proposes the establishment by Congress of a new agency with
   government-wide authority, the Commission provided a draft of the
   report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and
   comment in December 2000. With the concurrence of the Commission, OMB,
   in turn, circulated the draft to other agencies for their review and
   comment. OMB informed NCLIS in January 2001 that a number of agencies
   raised significant concerns about the draft report and, in particular,
   disagreed with its legislative recommendations. Due to the requests the
   Commission received from Congress asking that the report be submitted
   for its consideration, the Commission has not had an opportunity to
   discuss these concerns with the other agencies and, therefore, this
   report does not seek to respond to those concerns. The Commission will
   continue to work with other agencies on these issues in the coming
   months. Similarly, although a wide variety of stakeholders were
   encouraged to participate in the development of this report and their
   comments were extremely useful to the Commission, these recommendations
   do not necessarily represent a consensus of stakeholders. In its 1975
   publication entitled Toward a National Program for Library and
   Information Services: Goals for Action, the Commission offered a
   long-range program for the development of an integrated nationwide
   network of library and information services. The following statement
   appears in that landmark document: The Commission's current goal is to
   develop a plan for a flexible network of information services to meet
   the immediate and foreseeable information requirements of the greatest
   possible number of people. The Commission will therefore continue to
   concentrate its efforts in the years ahead on this ideal: To eventually
   provide every individual in the United States with equal opportunity of
   access to that part of the total information resource which will
   satisfy the individual's educational, working, cultural and
   leisure-time needs and interests, regardless of the 1-2 A Comprehensive
   Assessment of Public Information Dissemination individual's location,
   social or physical condition or level of intellectual achievement.8
   [emphasis added] In working toward the attainment of this goal, the
   Commission recommends in this report programs and enabling federal
   legislation that are based on existing programs for the dissemination
   of public information resources, as well as new programs as appropriate
   and necessary. One such recommendation is that the United States
   Government formally recognize and affirm the concept that public
   information is a strategic national resource.9 The success of such a
   goal, and of these recommendations, is dependent on the acceptance and
   full support of the Congress, the Administration, the library
   profession, the information community-both public and private-and, most
   importantly, the people of the United States. 8 U.S. National
   Commission on Libraries and Information Science, Toward a National
   Program for Library and Information Services: Goals for Action,

   Recognition of public information as a strategic national asset does
   not imply exploitation of that asset to generate revenue for the
   government, like the sale of lumber or mineral rights on federal land.
   On the contrary, it must result in optimizing timely and permanent
   public access to the information for its owners, the people of the
   United States. 1-3 U.S. National Commission on Libraries and
   Information Science B. BACKGROUND THE CENTRAL ISSUE Public sector
   information, or simply public information, has very rapidly become in
   the span of just the last few years one of the most critical strategic
   assets possessed by every nation state, on a par with national wealth,
   land, and capital. The Internet and the World Wide Web are the main
   technological reason, but there have been a number of other factors at
   play as well. Public sector information has always played a very
   important role in the political, economic, and social affairs of every
   country. Yet the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web have
   dramatically escalated the importance of public information because of
   the power of the Internet to tremendously increase its availability and
   accessibility in a great variety of different electronic formats and
   mediums. It has been argued, "information content is to wealth
   generation in the Internet Age as raw materials were to wealth
   generation in the Industrial Age."10 The central challenge of this
   report is to recommend to the President and the Congress a series of
   steps to maximize the diffusion of the government's data, information,
   and knowledge resources (sometimes referred to as "intellectual
   capital") to all sectors of society, including individual citizens, and
   to empower all of those sectors and individuals to utilize that
   knowledge effectively and efficiently in the pursuit of their
   respective personal, family, career, business, institutional, or other
   goals and objectives. In short, to recommend steps to treat public
   information resources as a strategic national asset. A very high
   percentage of this nation's knowledge resources, or intellectual
   capital, is invested in its government data, document, and literature
   assets, but those assets are a very long ways, as yet, from being
   conveniently, cost-effectively, and equitably available and accessible
   to all sectors of American society despite impressive initiatives that
   have been taken in recent years. The government's knowledge assets are
   currently strewn across broad physical and electronic landscapes of
   tens of thousands of websites and millions of web pages, hundreds of
   thousands of electronic databases, untold numbers of paper and
   microform document collections, and in countless files, records
   depositories, clearinghouses, and archives across the country and even
   abroad. From a purely economic and efficiency standpoint, the
   government is certainly correct in making the case that posting an
   increasing percentage of its public information on agency websites has
   shifted the cost of access to the information more directly to the
   individual users who benefit from the information, as opposed to the
   taxpayers as a whole (although the operation and administration of the
   websites are funded with tax dollars). This is, in principle, a good
   thing. However, offsetting this positive is a negative. There is now so
   much electronic information to wade through that is difficult to find
   what is relevant and useful. As a result, there is an even greater need
   for a single, central comprehensive and authoritative inventory and
   database of public information resources and for more proactive agency
   dissemination of public information. 10 Paul G. Zurkowski, "Creating
   the Magic of Information," available as Appendix 21 in Volume 3 of this

   1-4 A Comprehensive Assessment of Public Information Dissemination
   Certainly the digital library initiatives offer one of the most
   promising avenues because the digital library concept does entail
   collection of electronic information resources that are enhanced with
   organization, quality control, help for searching and browsing, support
   of particular targeted user communities, mechanisms for handling
   electronic publishing, and other capabilities. The central challenge of
   this report is to recommend to the President and the Congress, as well
   as the Judiciary, a series of steps to maximize the diffusion of the
   government's data, information, and knowledge resources (sometimes
   referred to as "intellectual capital") to all sectors of society,
   including individual citizens, and to empower all of those sectors and
   individuals to utilize that knowledge effectively and efficiently in
   the pursuit of their respective personal, family, career, business,
   institutional, or other goals and objectives. In short, to recommend
   steps to treat public information resources as a strategic national
   asset. This is a far more daunting challenge than just strengthening
   the dissemination of public information. Transforming Public

   Transforming Public Information Resources into a Strategic National
   Asset Figure 1 graphically depicts as a schematic "equation" the
   elements necessary to transform public information resources into a
   strategic national asset, managed for the benefit of the people.
   Achieving the goal of treating public information as a strategic
   national asset can be viewed as a combination of a number of equations
   elements, all of which have a role to play: first accessing
   information, to which is added proactive dissemination of information,
   while subtracting certain information that is statutorily protected so
   that it is safeguarded, and finally ensuring that users are adequately
   trained to search, 1-5 U.S. National Commission on Libraries and
   Information Science retrieve and evaluate the information, both from
   the point of view of physical access (computer literacy) and
   intellectual access (information literacy). Thirty eight years ago in
   his preface to a Report of the President's Science Advisory Committee
   chaired by Jerome Wiesner, "Science, government, and Information,"
   President John Kennedy said "One of the major opportunities for
   enhancing the effectiveness of our national scientific and technical
   effort and the efficiency of government management of research and
   development lies in the improvement of our ability to communicate
   information about current research efforts and the results of past
   efforts." The very first paragraph of this same report begins "Transfer
   of information is an inseparable part of research and development. All
   those concerned with research and development  individual scientists
   and engineers, industrial and academic research establishments,
   technical societies, government agencies  must accept responsibility
   for the transfer of information in the same degree and spirit that they
   accept responsibility for research and development itself."11 Twelve
   years ago the landmark Office of Technology Assessment report Informing
   the Nation raised six broad policy questions in connection with reform
   initiatives. The answers to these questions are as relevant to a
   careful consideration of the reform initiatives contemplated in this
   report today as they were by the reform initiatives being addressed by
   the Technology Assessment Board of the 100th Congress, then chaired by
   Morris K. Udall and Ted Stevens: * Congressional commitment to public
   access to federal information. * The need for revision of
   government-wide information dissemination policy-particularly regarding
   cost-effectiveness. * The role of the private sector. * Electronic vs.
   paper formats. * The need for clarification of institutional roles and
   responsibilities. * Improvements in information dissemination
   management.12 In 1992, the participants in the interagency conferences
   on public access to government information, known as the Solomons
   conferences, created a policy framework for public access to electronic
   government information. The guiding principle of that policy framework
   is: Agencies of the federal government collect, produce, manipulate,
   evaluate, maintain, distribute, publish, and archive vast amounts of
   data, which represents a valuable national resource that belongs to the
   people. Some of this is subject to limitations on dissemination,
   ranging from national security classification through FOIA exemptions.
   However, it is in the best interest of the country and the
   responsibility of these federal agencies to ensure the availability of
   the remaining government information to the public in a useful and
   cost-effective manner. 11 U.S. President's Science Advisory Committee,

   Technical Community and the Government in the Transfer of Information,

   Comprehensive Assessment of Public Information Dissemination
   Guidelines: * The agency's mission should be framed as broadly as
   possible. It should enable rather than discourage dissemination. *
   Agencies should follow the principle that federal data cannot be
   copyrighted. * When defining an approach, FOIA should be interpreted to
   include all information regardless of form or media.13 The government
   itself acknowledges through OMB Circular A-130, "While millions of
   information users in the public may be affected by the agency's action,
   only a handful may have direct contact with the agency's own
   information dissemination products."14 The fundamental basis for public
   access to government information is found in Title 17 of the U.S. Code,
   which specifically prohibits copyright of federal information.15 This
   is augmented by other laws, including the Freedom of Information Act
   (FOIA), the Electronic Freedom of Information Act (E-FOIA), the
   Administrative Procedure Act, and the Government in the Sunshine Act.
   Hundreds of other federal laws that have some provision or another for
   disseminating government information to the public or providing public
   access for one or more of the following purposes: * Publicize a citizen
   entitlement and spell out the procedures that need to be following to
   apply for a tangible government public benefit or service. * Publicize
   opportunities for the private sector to do business with, or for, the
   federal government, either domestically in the U.S. or abroad, or both.
   * Publicize and disseminate the results of government's performance and
   operations through audits, inspections, studies, opinions, decisions
   taken, and so forth. * Provide for intergovernmental or interagency
   information interchange. * Provide a broad legal basis for requesting
   public access to government information, identifying specific
   exceptions and exemptions, such as occurs in the Freedom of Information
   Act and the Privacy Act, or specifically exempting from disclosure
   large bodies of government information holdings such as information
   classified for reasons of national security. However, none of these
   existing laws provides a rationale and statutory basis for the
   positive, broad diffusion, and the wide-spread utilization, of the
   government's knowledge assets by individual Americans, both advantaged
   and disadvantaged, to help them cope with their daily problems, to
   enlighten and educate them so that they are better informed citizens
   and more empowered individuals, and to point the way to how the
   government's vast knowledge treasures can enhance the quality of their
   lives and the wisdom of their decisions.16 13 J. Timothy Sprehe,

   The prohibition of copyright for federal government information is
   contained in Title 17 U.S. C. 105: "Copyright protection under this
   title is not available for any work of the United States Government,
   but the United States Government is not precluded from receiving and
   holding copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or
   otherwise." 16 The one possible exception is 44 U.S.C. Chapter 19, the
   statute authorizing the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP);
   however, the lack of agency compliance and the absence of substantial
   consequences for failure to comply have limited the effectiveness of
   this statute. 1-7 U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information
   Science WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING In 1998 the European Commission
   issued its report entitled Public Sector Information: A Key Resource
   For Europe; Green Paper on Public Sector Information in the Information
   Society.17 In its report the European Union said: Public sector
   information plays a fundamental role in the proper functioning of the
   internal market and the free circulation of goods, services and people.
   Without user- friendly and readily available administrative,
   legislative, financial or other public information, economic actors
   cannot make fully informed decisions. Public information in Europe is
   often fragmented and dispersed and so in many instances it is less
   clear and intended. This situation is mainly due to differing national
   legislation on the ways information can be accessed and exploited, and
   to various practices which hamper the availability of the data. The
   issue at stake is not that Member States should produce more
   information, but that the information, which is already available to
   the public, should be clearer and more accessible to potential users.18
   In 1999 UNESCO said virtually the same thing about the role of public
   authorities in access to information: While industry and business are
   principally responsible for providing the infrastructure for access to
   information resources, governments and the civil society have a
   responsibility to make information considered as a "global public good"
   universally available for educational, cultural and social needs. The
   challenge is to define the concepts of public domain and universal
   access in a global context to promote the common public welfare while
   encouraging private initiative and protecting rightful economic
   interests.19 On November 30, 1999, the new UNESCO Director-General,
   Koichiro Matsuura, at the Opening Session of the World Summit of
   Regulators conference (with the theme "Internet and the New Services")
   stressed that the international community must make all efforts in
   order to ensure that information in the public domain is an essential
   element of the global common good, and must be promoted and protected.
   In the United Kingdom, the Central IT Unit of the Minister of State has
   recently issued a report entitled E-Government: A Strategic Framework
   for Public Services in the Information Age. This report states as a
   fundamental premise: "The government's knowledge and information are
   valuable resources."20 The report goes on to say: 17 European

   Assessment of Public Information Dissemination The public sector needs
   to move towards managing the information it holds as a corporate
   resource to benefit citizens and business and to improve the
   effectiveness and efficiency of government itself. This will require *
   Definition and adoption by public sector bodies of corporate standards
   for data entities that are common across the public sector; for
   example, citizen name and address. CITU will publish these in the
   interoperability framework and will monitor their adoption * Definition
   and adoption by public sector bodies of common meanings for common data
   descriptions, so that information accessed by public servants or the
   public can be understood and used effectively * A framework for
   departments and agencies to implement electronic records management
   systems * A common policy of the use of metadata.21 Finally, Canadian
   international trade and investment lawyer and legal specialist, writing
   recently in an international journal to an audience of librarians and
   information professionals on the subject of the relationship between
   information and world trade, had this to say: It seems to me that there
   is a particular role for librarians to play as well, and not just as
   the defenders of public libraries, although without your determined
   intervention I fear the era of such public institutions, which as you
   know began only a lit
