   CERTS is developing technology solutions that enable competitive market
   outcomes, while at the same time protect the public interest in
   reliable electric services. CERTS conducts public interest electricity
   reliability research in four areas:

   Real-Time Grid Operations and Reliability Management  develops tools
          and technologies that help monitor and operate the power system
          more reliably in a competitive electric market structure, and
          lay the groundwork for a transition to a smart, switchable
          network in the future that can anticipate and respond
          automatically to emerging problems. Current research focuses on
          prototyping and demonstrating real-time reliability management
          tools; developing new system security management tools; and
          conducting basis research and outreach on advanced measurement
          technologies and controls.

   Reliability and Markets  conducts science-based analysis and
          demonstrations of options for increasing the effectiveness of
          market-based approaches for managing reliability. Current
          research focuses on evaluating market mechanisms for reliability
          management and assessing the reliability impacts of market
          operations through a combination of theoretical and experimental
          economics approaches; demonstrating load as a reliability
          resource in the field.

   Distributed Energy Resources Integration  tdevelops tools and
          techniques to maintain and enhance the reliability of
          electricity systems through reliance on a cost-effective,
          decentralized electricity system involving significant
          penetration of distributed energy resources (DER). Current
          research focuses on developing tools and data, and conducting
          field tests of advanced concepts for the protection, control,
          and system integration of large numbers of small (< 1 MW) DER
          organized in Microgrids operating in the low voltage
          distribution system.

   Reliability Technology Issues and Needs Assessment  monitors and
          identifies technology trends and emerging gaps in electricity
          system reliability R&D in order to anticipate public interest
          R&D needed to enable the grid of the future. Recent activities
          include: Grid of the Future White Papers, U.S. Department of
          Energy Power Outage Study Team, IEEE-CERTS Conference: Ensuring
          Electric Power Reliability: The Challenges Ahead
