What are the neurofibromatoses?

   The neurofibromatoses are genetic disorders of the nervous system that
   primarily affect the development and growth of neural (nerve) cell
   tissues. These disorders cause tumors to grow on nerves and produce
   other abnormalities such as skin changes and bone deformities. The
   neurofibromatoses occur in both sexes and in all races and ethnic
   groups. Scientists have classified the disorders as neurofibromatosis
   type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Other or variant types
   of the neurofibromatoses may exist, but are not yet identified.

What is NF1?

   NF1 is the more common type of the neurofibromatoses, occurring in
   about 1 in 4,000 individuals in the United States. Although many
   affected persons inherit the disorder, between 30 and 50 percent of new
   cases arise spontaneously through mutation (change) in an individual's
   genes. Once this change has taken place, the mutant gene can be passed
   on to succeeding generations.

   Previously, NF1 was known as peripheral neurofibromatosis (or von
   Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis) because some of the symptoms--skin
   spots and tumors--seemed to be limited to the outer nerves, or
   peripheral nervous system, of the affected person. This name is no
   longer technically accurate because central nervous system tumors are
   now known to occur in NF1.

What are the signs and symptoms of NF1?

   In diagnosing NF1, a physician looks for two or more of the following:
     * five or more light brown skin spots (cafe-au-lait macules)
       measuring more than 5 millimeters in diameter in patients under the
       age of puberty or more than 15 millimeters across in adults and
       children over the age of puberty;
     * two or more neurofibromas (tumors that grow on a nerve or nerve
       tissue, under the skin) or one plexiform neurofibroma (involving
       many nerves);
     * freckling in the armpit or groin areas;
     * benign growths on the iris of the eye (known as Lisch nodules or
       iris hamartomas);
     * a tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma);
     * severe scoliosis (curvature of the spine);
     * enlargement or deformation of certain bones other than the spine;
       and
     * a parent, sibling, or child with NF1.

When do symptoms appear?

   Symptoms, particularly those on the skin, are often evident at birth or
   during infancy, and almost always by the time a child is about 10 years
   old. Neurofibromas become evident at around 10 to 15 years of age. In
   most cases, symptoms are mild and patients live normal and productive
   lives. In some cases, however, NF1 can be severely debilitating.

   Symptoms and severity of the disorder may vary among members of
   affected families.

How is NF1 treated?

   Treatments are presently aimed at controlling symptoms. Surgery can
   help some bone malformations. For scoliosis, bone surgery may be
   combined with back braces. Surgery can also remove painful or
   disfiguring tumors; however, there is a chance that the tumors may grow
   back and in greater numbers. In the rare instances when tumors become
   malignant (3 to 5 percent of all cases), treatment may include surgery,
   radiation, or chemotherapy.

What is NF2?

   This less common of the neurofibromatoses affects about 1 in 40,000
   persons. NF2 is characterized by bilateral (occurring on both sides of
   the body) tumors on the eighth cranial nerve. It was formerly called
   bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis or central neurofibromatosis
   because the tumors, which cause progressive hearing loss, were thought
   to grow primarily on the auditory nerve, a branch of the eighth cranial
   nerve responsible for hearing. Scientists now know that the tumors
   typically occur on the vestibular nerve, another branch of the eighth
   cranial nerve near the auditory nerve. The tumors, called vestibular
   schwannomas for their location and for the type of cells in them, cause
   pressure damage to neighboring nerves. In some cases, the damage to
   nearby vital structures, such as other cranial nerves and the
   brainstem, can be life-threatening.

What are the signs and symptoms of NF2?

   To determine if an individual has NF2, a physician looks for the
   following:

   1. bilateral eighth nerve tumors,

   2. a parent, sibling, or child with NF2 and a unilateral eighth nerve
   tumor, or

   3. a parent, sibling, or child with NF2 and any two of the following:
     * glioma,
     * meningioma,
     * neurofibroma,
     * schwannoma, or
     * cataract at an early age.

When do symptoms appear?

   Affected individuals may notice hearing loss as early as the teen
   years. In addition to changes in hearing that may occur in one or both
   ears, other early symptoms may include tinnitus (ringing noise in the
   ear) and poor balance. Headache, facial pain, or facial numbness,
   caused by pressure from the tumors, may also occur.

How is NF2 treated?

   Treatments for NF2 are aimed at controlling the symptoms. Improved
   diagnostic technologies, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), can
   reveal tumors as small as a few millimeters in diameter, thus allowing
   early treatment. Surgery to remove tumors completely is one option, but
   may result in hearing loss. Other options include partial removal of
   tumors, radiation, and, if the tumors are not progressing rapidly, the
   conservative approach of watchful waiting.

Are there prenatal tests for the neurofibromatoses?

   Genetic testing is available for families with documented cases of NF1
   and NF2. Genetic analysis can be used to confirm clinical diagnosis if
   the disease is a result of familial inheritance. New (spontaneous)
   mutations cannot be confirmed genetically. Prenatal diagnosis of
   familial NF1 or NF2 is also possible utilizing amniocentesis or
   chorionic villus sampling procedures. Genetic counselors can provide
   information about these procedures and offer guidance in coping with
   the neurofibromatoses.

What do scientists know about the neurofibromatoses?

   Formerly the neurofibromatoses were grouped as one disorder with at
   least two variations. Scientists now know that NF1 and NF2 are two
   distinct entities because the genes believed to be responsible for them
   are located on different chromosomes. The NF1 gene is on chromosome 17,
   while the gene for NF2 is on chromosome 22.

   Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, receiving one set of 23
   chromosomes from each parent. Chromosomes carry genes that determine an
   individual's characteristics, such as sex, stature, hair and eye color,
   and distinctive family traits. Genes produce proteins that control an
   individual's development and health. If an inherited gene is defective,
   or a gene becomes defective spontaneously before birth, a genetic
   disorder may result. The neurofibromatoses are inherited as dominant
   disorders, which means that if either parent has the defective gene,
   each child born to that parent has a 50 percent chance of inheriting
   the defective gene.

What research is being done on the neurofibromatoses?

   The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a
   unit of the Federal Government's National Institutes of Health (NIH),
   has primary responsibility for conducting and supporting research on
   neurological disorders. The Institute sponsors basic studies aimed at
   understanding normal and abnormal development of the brain and nervous
   system, and clinical studies to improve diagnosis and treatment of
   neurological disorders. In conjunction with the NIH's National Cancer
   Institute, the NINDS encourages research specifically targeted on the
   neurofibromatoses.

   Several years ago, research teams supported by the NINDS located the
   exact position of the NF1 gene on chromosome 17. The NF1 gene has been
   cloned and its structure analyzed. The product of the NF1 gene is a
   large and complex protein called neurofibromin. One portion of this
   protein is similar to a family of proteins called GAP (guanosine
   triphosphatase-activating protein). Scientists have demonstrated that
   GAP proteins play a significant role in tumor suppression in certain
   cancers. The proteins act as switches that regulate the complex
   chemical interactions and sequences of cell growth. The similarity of
   the NF1 protein to GAP proteins suggests that the NF1 protein may have
   a similar switching role in the development of neurofibromas.
   Scientists theorize that defects in the gene may lessen or inhibit the
   normal output of its protein and allow the irregular cell growth that
   may lead to tumor development.

   In addition to the work on NF1, intensive efforts have led to the
   identification of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22. As in NF1, the NF2
   gene product is a tumor suppressor protein (termed merlin or
   schwannomin). Basic studies in molecular genetics may lead one day to
   nonsurgical or pharmacologic treatments aimed at retarding or
   suppressing tumors associated with the neurofibromatoses.

   The NINDS also encourages research aimed at developing improved methods
   of diagnosing the neurofibromatoses and at identifying factors that
   contribute to the wide variations of symptoms and severity of the
   disorders. Early diagnosis of the neurofibromatoses is essential so
   that affected individuals can obtain treatment, counseling, and
   referral to specialized facilities.

   The Interinstitute Medical Genetics Research Program at the NIH
   Clinical Center conducts NF2 family history research, including a study
   involving individuals and families with NF2. With information from this
   study, investigators have confirmed the location of the NF2 gene on
   chromosome 22. Also, using specimens from some of the families,
   scientists have isolated and sequenced the NF2 gene, and have described
   two different patterns of clinical features in NF2 patients.
   Investigators are continuing to study these patterns to see if they
   correspond to specific types of gene mutations.

How can I help research?

   The NINDS contributes to the support of two national human specimen
   banks, one at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Los Angeles
   and the other at McLean Hospital near Boston. These banks supply
   investigators around the world with tissue from patients with
   neurological and other disorders. Both banks need tissue from
   individuals with NF1 or NF2 to enable scientists to study these
   disorders more intensely. Prospective donors may write to:
