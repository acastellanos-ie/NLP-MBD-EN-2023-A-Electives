   SlideShow As web technologies continue to improve, web-enabled access
   to information products, services, and applications have progressed
   from a nicety to a necessity. The U.S. Geological Suryey recognizes the
   increased importance of web technologies to meet the needs for
   efficient delivery of geo-spatial data and applications to our
   partners, cooperators, and public customers. The Rocky Mountain
   Web-Based Mapping Team contributes to this effort by researching
   cutting edge web concepts and technologies, and applying this

   research in the development of sophisticated geo-spatial web mapping
   sites.
   The Web-Based Mapping team supports a broad range of web-related
   activities. These activities range from researching leading-edge web
   technologies required for the next generation of web applications, to
   development of specific geo-spatial web-enabled applications. The goal
   of the Rocky Mountain Mapping Center's Web-Based Mapping Team is to not
   only support the National Mapping Division's mission of efficient
   information access and delivery via the web, but to help lead the way.
