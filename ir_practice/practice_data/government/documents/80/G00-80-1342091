                                 SCOPE OF SERVICE

      The Puget Sound Health Care System provides a Chaplain Service at both
      divisions to offer spiritual care to inpatients, outpatients, and their
      families in cooperation with the health care team. This is provided by
      a staff of qualified Chaplains endorsed by faith groups recognized by
      the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Chaplain staff have multiple
      areas of training, experience and expertise for service to patients,
      their families, staff and other customers of VA services. Our staff
      includes Protestant, Catholic and Jewish Chaplains. Our volunteers and
      interns have received specialized training for pastoral care ministry
      and have a wealth of experience in ministry to patients and their
      families.
      The Chaplains do daily visitation to all intensive care units and
      hospital wards to establish rapport with patients and their families
      and to assist with spiritual needs as appropriate. A spiritual
      assessment is done as soon as possible. All faiths are included and
      contacts are made in the community for patients who desire such
      service. The Chaplain Service maintains a religious community resources
      referral book so that patients and their families may be assisted by
      religious/spiritual representatives from their faith groups. Staff
      Chaplains assist visiting clergy and/or religious representatives as
      liaisons with the Health Care System staff and to interpret treatment
      goals.
      The Chaplain Service works together with other disciplines in an
      interdisciplinary team effort. We are involved in clinical pathways,
      cross-functional teams, serve in an active role on the Hospice team,
      participate in the development of the Patient Rights program, serve on
      the Mental Health Advisory Board, the Ethics Advisory Committee and
      provide counsel and support to patients concerning Advance Care
      Directives. The Chaplains frequently consult with the medical staff to
      aid in the treatment of patients. Matters of religious belief, moral
      concerns, conscience, custom and tradition that may affect patient's
      diagnosis and treatment are addressed. Referrals from Health Care
      System Staff are welcomed and encouraged.
      Each hospital division provides Chapels for meditation, inspiration,
      and religious services. Chaplain offices are located on each campus for
      Chaplain ministry. Worship services are held for patients and spiritual
      comfort is provided, particularly at times of critical illnesses,
      surgery, death, disaster, etc. As an integral part of the treatment
      team, the Chaplains are available to provide individual, marital,
      family and group counseling where appropriate regarding such concerns
      as loss of meaning of life, unresolved grief, feelings of guilt, shame
      or resentment over past experiences, family conflicts, spiritual injury
      due to military training or experience, confusion or misunderstanding
      about one's religious faith and practices, and questions and problems
      of ethical significance.

                         CLINICAL PASTORAL EDUCATION (CPE)

      Offering Quarterly Training for those interested in pastoral care.

      Purpose: Clinical Pastoral Education focuses on personal and pastoral
      identity formation, professional growth, and competence in ministry.
      CPE teaches the chaplain how to work as a member of an
      interdisciplinary patient care team.

                                              Eternal Life

                                Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace:
                                 Where there is hatred, let me sow love;
                                     Where there is injury, pardon;
                                      Where there is doubt, faith;
                                      Where there is despair, hope;
                                     Where there is darkness, light;
                                      Where there is sadness, joy.
                                            O Divine Master,
                                    grant that I may not so much seek
                                      To be consoled as to console,
                                   To be understood as to understand,
                                         To be loved as to love;
                                  For it is in giving that we receive;
                                It is in pardoning that we are pardoned;
                            It is in dying that we are born to eternal life!
                                          St. Francis of Assisi
