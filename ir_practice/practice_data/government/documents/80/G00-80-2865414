                      Information Technology and Resource Use

   What's new

             New report by Jennifer Mitchell-Jackson, May 16th, 2001:
             Electricity used by data centers, based on measured data (424K
             PDF). This study explains why most estimates of power used by
             data centers are significantly too high, and gives measured
             power use data for five such facilities. Total power use for the
             computer room area of these data centers is no more than 40
             W/square foot, including all auxiliary power use and cooling
             energy.

             The August 2001 issue of Business 2.0 contains a summary of the
             debate over electricity use of office equipment: "Is the Net to
             Blame for the Energy Crisis?", by Todd Lappin.


   Project Description

             This ongoing project explores the effects of computers and other
             information technology on resource use. In 1995, we published a
             comprehensive assessment of electricity used in
             commercial-sector office equipment (Koomey et al. 1995, below).
             This study also is summarized on the web. It did not address
             energy used by network hardware, but it did deal explicitly with
             stocks, energy use per unit, and operating hours to estimate
             total electricity used by commercial sector office equipment in
             the U.S. It compiled measured data on many of these parameters,
             which guided the creation of the scenarios generated in that
             report.

             In the years since our 1995 study was published, the Internet
             has grown into a substantial force in the U.S. economy. In 1999,
             Mark P. Mills published a report for the Greening Earth Society
             (summarized in an article in Forbes Magazine) that attempted to
             calculate the "Internet related" portion of electricity use.
             This report claimed that electricity use associated with the
             Internet totaled about 8 percent of all U.S. electricity use in
             1998 and that it would grow to half of all electricity use in
             the next decade. Subsequent to the publication of this report,
             there was an exchange of technical emails between Amory Lovins,
             Mark Mills, and others.

             We examine Mills' calculations of current Internet-related
             electricity use in a technical memo. We find that Mills has
             significantly overestimated electricity use, in some cases by
             more than an order of magnitude. We adjust his estimates to
             reflect measured data and more accurate assumptions, which
             reduces Mills' overall estimate of total Internet-related
             electricity use by about a factor of eight.

             In addition to estimating direct energy use associated with
             office equipment and related network hardware, we are beginning
             to assess the indirect effects of the Internet on the resource
             use of the U.S. economy. These effects include structural change
             (where new institutional arrangements and technological
             capabilities become possible because of the Internet) and
             substitution effects (where the new technologies substitute for
             established energy uses). The net effect of the Internet cannot
             be assessed without a comprehensive understanding of structural
             change and substitution.

             On February 2, 2000, the House Subcommittee on National Economic
             Growth, Natural Resources, and Regulatory Affairs held hearings
             on "Kyoto and the Internet: the Energy Implications of the
             Digital Economy". At that hearing, Jay Hakes, Joseph Romm, and
             Mark Mills testified. Hakes' testimony dealt mainly with the
             data used to understand recent events in the overall economy,
             but he also concluded that Mills had overestimated electricity
             use substantially. Romm's testimony focused mainly on the
             indirect effects of information technology (IT) on resource use,
             and cited a large number of examples of how IT can reduce
             overall resource use. Mills' testimony attempted to address a
             few of the issues we raised, but his anecdotal response did not
             in any way invalidate the main conclusion of our memo (our
             line-by-line rebuttal addresses the points Mills raised in his
             testimony).

             In June 2000, we completed another comprehensive assessment of
             office equipment energy use, and in February 2001 we completed
             final revisions on the analysis and added documentation. The
             final report includes electricity used by network equipment, and
             estimates total energy use for residential, commercial, and
             industrial sectors. Note that this report does not focus just on
             the "internet related" portion of electricity use as the Forbes
             article does, so care must be used in comparing the findings of
             those two studies. We find that total electricity used by all
             office equipment in the U.S. is about 2% of all electricity use.
             Commercial sector office equipment electricity use is within 15%
             of that predicted for 2000 in our 1995 report (for those enduses
             that are comparable between the two reports), and the difference
             is explainable by more people leaving their computers and
             printers on at night than we expected in 1995. This report
             confirms the results of our earlier technical memo and 1995
             report. The explosive growth in electricity demand that Mills
             alleges simply does not show up in the data.

             In August 2000, Koomey finished a detailed rebuttal of Mills'
             congressional testimony, which addressed each and every point
             raised by Mills. The detailed calculations in the rebuttal show
             that electricity used for all office, telecommunications, and
             network equipment (including electricity used to manufacture the
             equipment) is about 3% of total electricity use in the U.S. This
             estimate is about a factor of four lower than the 13% claimed by
             Mills.

             This story has received much attention in the media. Dr. Koomey
             has been interviewed by dozens of news organizations, including
             All Things Considered (NPR), Marketplace (8-9 minutes into the
             show), the SF Chronicle, Business 2.0, Salon.com, and Salon.com
             radio. A comprehensive summary of the details of the debate is
             contained in an article in Network Magazine.

             download the presentation by Joe Eto and Chris Marnay of
             LBNL(Acrobat pdf format, 1MB, January 26, 2001). In spite of
             what many people believe, demand growth has been relatively
             modest in California over the past 10 years. The California
             Energy Commission has data on demand growth over time for
             California as a whole, as well as for Silicon Valley by itself.
             Both sources show modest growth in overall electricity use that
             is driven primarily by population growth and economic activity.
             The San Francisco Chronicle, after examining the data, concluded
             in a recent article that "soaring power use is more fiction than
             fact."

             In May 2001, Jennifer Mitchell-Jackson finished her M.S. Thesis
             on electricity used by data centers. Koomey advised Ms.
             Mitchell-Jackson on this work, which carefully describes the
             reasons why most estimates of power used by these facilities are
             too high, and presents measured data on the power used by these
             facilities from both the top down (billing data) and the bottom
             up (counting equipment and measuring or estimating actual power
             used for each piece of equipment, then adding it up). It also
             gives our current best estimate of power used by these
             facilities for the U.S. as a whole, which is no more than 0.12%
             of all electric power at the end of 2000.

             Mark Mills has also claimed in many articles and speeches that
             the networking equipment supported a wireless Palm Pilot uses as
             much electricity as a refrigerator. The documentation for this
             claim has never been published, and Koomey has requested the
             documentation from Mills in email on nine separate occasions
             since 7 September 2000, with no response. You can read the email
             trail of these requests.
