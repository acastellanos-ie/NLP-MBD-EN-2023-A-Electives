      The California Department of Insurance Fraud Division (originally the
      Bureau of Fraudulent Claims) was established in 1979 to protect the
      public from economic loss and distress by actively investigating and
      arresting those who commit insurance fraud. The Fraud Division
      investigates three separate anti-fraud programs: Automobile, Workers
      Compensation, and Special Operations (which includes property, health,
      life and disability insurance fraud).

   Insurance Fraud Costs Consumers

      According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), insurance
      fraud nationwide totals $20 billion annually. In California alone, it
      is estimated that from $1 to $3 billion is attributable to workers'
      compensation fraud annually. Insurance fraud results in higher
      insurance premiums and contributes to higher prices of goods and
      services to the consumer. It is estimated that auto insurance fraud
      alone costs each consumer an additional $200 a year per policy.

      All licensed California insurance companies (approx. 1,500) are
      required by law to report suspected fraudulent claims to the Fraud
      Division for review and possible investigation. Citizen complaints and
      Division-initiated cases round out the sources of investigations.

      Basic funding for the Fraud Division is derived from a $1,000 annual
      assessment of each licensed insurance company. Additional special
      assessment funding is provided for the enhanced investigation and
      prosecution of automobile and workers compensation fraud. No general
      tax revenue is used.

   Organization

      Fraud Division Regional Offices are located in Sacramento, Martinez,
      City of Commerce, Garden Grove, San Diego, Fresno, San Jose and Rancho
      Cucamonga.

      Each regional office maintains a staff of criminal investigators, which
      investigates cases from all three fraud programs, and provides training
      and assistance to allied law enforcement agencies. Prosecutable fraud
      cases are presented to the appropriate county and federal prosecutors
      served by the regional offices.

      Fraud Division investigators are trained peace officers who are
      required by law to maintain Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST)
      certification. Division investigators are authorized to carry firearms,
      serve warrants and make arrests.
