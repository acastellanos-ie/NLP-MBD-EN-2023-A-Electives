                              Social Security Online
                                  Privacy Policy

      The privacy of our customers has always been of utmost importance to
      the Social Security Administration. In fact, our first regulation (see
      http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/401/401-0000.htm) was written to
      ensure your privacy. As a Federal agency, the Privacy Act of 1974 (5
      U.S.C. 552a) requires us to protect the information we collect from
      you. (See http://www.ssa.gov/privacyact.htm ). The privacy policy
      outlined below applies to the data we collect from you over the
      Internet.

                            Our Internet Privacy Policy

      This is our notice to you about why we collect your personal
      information, how we use it, and who we share it with; what your choices
      are for how we use your information; how to get access to your
      information; and how we protect the information we collect and
      maintain.

      Why we collect your personal information
        * We collect personal data to administer the Social Security program.
          We do not use the information for any other internal secondary
          purpose.
        * You dont have to give us personal information to visit our website.
        * If you do give us your personal information, we treat it very
          carefully.
        * We collect personal information about you (e.g., name, email
          address, Social Security number or other unique identifier) only if
          you specifically and knowingly give it to us.

      How we will use your personal information
        * We do not sell the information we collect at this site, or any
          information we collect.
        * The personal information you give us at this site will be used only
          in connection with the administration of the Social Security
          Program and for other purposes as described in this document or at
          the point the information is collected.
        * For statistical purposes, we also collect non-personal information
          about you (see http://www.ssa.gov/web_stats.html). Sometimes we
          analyze this data to determine customer interest in different parts
          of our website. The information we share is in a format that does
          not personally identify anyone.

      Who we will share your personal information with
        * We may disclose information you give us (e.g., to Railroad
          Retirement Board, Department of Veterans Affairs) if authorized or
          required by Federal law, such as the Privacy Act or the Social
          Security Act.

      Your choice about who we share your personal information with
        * If Federal laws (e.g., Privacy Act, Social Security Act) do not
          allow us to share information, we must get your written
          authorization before we can discuss your information with anyone
          else.

      Your access to the information we collect about you
        * You may have access to any of the information we collect about you
          at this site. Well correct any errors you may find. If you need to
          get or fix information about you, see SSA regulation subsections
          401.40 and 401.65
          (http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/401/401-0000.htm).

      How we protect the security of the information we collect
        * The Internet was originally designed as an open system with no
          built in security; however, we are required to protect the
          information we collect and maintain about you and will not use the
          Internet to do business with you unless we can do so in a secure
          manner. We will take reasonable precautions to maintain the
          security, confidentiality and integrity of the information we
          collect at this site.
        * SSA sometimes uses contractors to perform various website and
          database functions. When we do, we make sure that the agreement
          language with the contractor ensures the security, confidentiality
          and integrity of any personal information the contractor may have
          access to in the course of contract performance.

      Our concern about sending personal information via email
        * Electronic mail is not secure. Therefore, we suggest that you dont
          send personal information to us via email. We will only send you
          general information via email.
        * Electronic mail messages that meet the definition of records in the
          Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) are covered under the
          same disposition schedule as all other Federal records. This means
          that emails you send us will be preserved and maintained for
          varying periods of time if those emails meet the definition of
          Federal records. Electronic messages that are not records are
          deleted when no longer needed.

      Our use of cookies and how it affects your visit to our website

      What is a cookie? A cookie is a small piece of text information that is
      sent to your computer along with a webpage when you access a website.
      Your computer will give the information on the cookie only to the
      computer that sent it and no other site can request it.

      There are different types of cookies-- persistent, third party, and
      session.

   PERSISTENT COOKIES

        * Persistent cookies stay on your computer for an extended period of
          time and are used to collect information about how you use the
          Internet. A persistent cookie reports that information back to the
          website that placed the cookie on your computer. We do not use
          persistent cookies.

   THIRD PARTY COOKIES

        * Third party cookies are cookies placed on your computer by someone
          other than the person who owns the website. Information about how
          you use the Internet is reported back to the third party. Most
          often, Internet advertising organizations that have commercial
          agreements with a website are the third parties that place these
          cookies on your computer. We do not use or allow third party
          cookies.

   SESSION COOKIES

        * A session cookie is placed on your computer when you visit a
          website but is automatically deleted at the end of your visit.
          Session cookies do not track and report how you use the Internet.
        * We do use session cookies for our searchable Frequently Asked
          Questions (FAQ) database (ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov), to help you use
          the Notification of Change feature. The Notification of Change
          feature allows us to notify you of any change in the answer to a
          question you were interested in. This session cookie allows you to
          request multiple notifications without reentering your email
          address for each request.
          We do not track your SSA Online visiting habits except for the
          above mentioned statistical purposes (and even then, the
          information is not associated to you personally).
