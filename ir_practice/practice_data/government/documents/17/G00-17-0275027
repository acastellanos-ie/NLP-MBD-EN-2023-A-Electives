      GCMRC Protocol Evaluation Program

         The Protocol Evaluation Program (PEP), is described in a prospectus
         entitled, Prospectus for Evaluating GCMRC Monitoring Protocols for the
         Colorado River Ecosystem" (see below). The information gained through
         the PEP process is intended to support decisions by the GCMRC Chief and
         his staff as to the specific monitoring protocols that will be used
         within the ecosystem. Details on the specific monitoring techniques
         will be discussed with the TWG and the Science Advisory Board (SAB),
         and conveyed through RFPs to prospective cooperators that are selected
         through a competitive process. Although technologies, science and
         management needs may cause evolution in monitoring protocols and
         strategies through time, the GCMRC is committed to ensuring that all
         monitoring data sets are comparable to the greatest extent possible
         with previously collected information.

         The PEP process for evaluating current and new alternative protocols in
         all program resources area is scheduled for completion by the end of FY
         2002.  A PEP review workshop on remote-sensing technologies was held in
         May 1998.  PEP review workshops for physical resource monitoring were
         held in August 1998, and 1999.  Reports on the results of those
         meetings have been submitted to the GCMRC and distributed to the TWG
         and AMWG.  PEP activities in FYs 2000 and 2001 will focus on protocols
         that support long-term monitoring of biological, cultural and social
         resources.  All PEP workshops and evaluations are conducted in
         cooperation with external experts identified through a nationwide
         scoping and competitive selection process, the SAB, as well as GCMRC
         science cooperators, contractors, technical workgroup members.

         Reports generated as part of the ongoing PEP are listed below.
