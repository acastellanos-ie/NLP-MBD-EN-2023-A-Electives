   January 16, 2002 ORA URGES PUC TO ENSURE EDISON SHAREHOLDERS CONTRIBUTE
   OVER $1 BILLION IN FOREGONE DIVIDENDS TO EDISON'S PAST UNDERCOLLECTION
   The Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) has filed comments urging the
   California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to uphold the public trust
   and the terms of the settlement it reached with Southern California
   Edison (Edison) to credit over $1 billion of foregone shareholder
   dividends toward Edison's undercollection of past costs from the energy
   crisis. ORA's comments on a proposed resolution, which is scheduled for
   a vote on January 23, 2002, demonstrated that a division of the
   Commission had reached a legally flawed conclusion that would require
   customers to pay over $1 billion that the utility had promised to
   contribute in reaching a settlement with the PUC on October 2, 2001.
   ORA's comments noted that both Edison's current public statements as
   well as the PUC's October 2, 2001 press release stated that the
   settlement ``Requires Edison shareholders to contribute at least $1.2
   billion in dividends to the recovery plan, as well an initial $300
   million adjustment to the beginning balance (emphasis in original).''
   The proposed resolution would result in ratepayers paying the utility
   back for each dollar of foregone dividends, whereas a contribution is
   given without compensation. ORA's comments also demonstrated that the
   semantic distinction that the Commission's division had reached between
   ``procurement-related obligations'' and ``procurement-related
   liabilities'' was clearly contradicted by language throughout the
   settlement agreement. ### Ratepayer Advocates in the Gas, Electric,
