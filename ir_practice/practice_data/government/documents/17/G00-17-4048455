              Discrimination Complaints & EO Counseling Program

   Langley Research Center's Equal Opportunity Counseling Program provides
   a means for resolving individual and class employment problems related
   to equal opportunity.

   The Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor is the first step for an
   employee or applicant who believes he or she has been discriminated
   against in some aspect of his or her job because of race, color,
   religion, sex, age, national origin, handicap, sexual harassment, or
   reprisal.

   If you believe you have been discriminated against and seek relief
   through the discrimination complaints process, you must make contact
   with the Pre-Complaint Counselor within 45 days of the alleged act.
