   The "2000 Plum Book" includes data on over 7,000 Federal Civil Service
      leadership and support positions in the legislative and executive
    branches of the Federal Government. The positions in the "Plum Book"
    may be subject to noncompetitive appointment. Agency heads and their
    immediate subordinates, policy executives and advisors, and aides who
       report to these officials are examples of positions that may be
                                  included.

        The "Plum Book" is published every four years, just after the
      Presidential election. The data in this edition is current as of
    September 1, 2000. The 1996 version is available in our archives. The
      next version of the "Plum Book" will be prepared for publication
       immediately following the November 2004 Presidential election.

      You may view the data online if you have the Adobe Acrobat Reader
   program installed with your web browser. If you do not have the Acrobat
       Reader installed, you can download a free copy of this reader.
