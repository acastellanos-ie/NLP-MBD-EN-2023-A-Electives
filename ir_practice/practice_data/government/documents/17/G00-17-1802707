      White House Announcement on the Appointment of Special Envoy to Sudan

      For the past 18 years Sudan has been embroiled in a complicated civil
      war that has directly and indirectly caused massive destruction and
      loss of life. An estimated two million Sudanese have died of
      war-related injuries, disease or starvation. Compounded by frequent
      droughts, the war has created a long-term humanitarian crisis,
      requiring enormous amounts of humanitarian assistance from the
      international community.

      Sudan The ongoing insecurity and population displacement have not only
      destroyed most of the indigenous trading and production systems, but
      continue to be major impediments to relief efforts. Operation Lifeline
      Sudan (OLS), established in 1989 in response to the conflict-related
      famine in the South, is a tripartite agreement of negotiated access
      among the Government of Sudan, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement,
      and the United Nations (U.N.). Under this framework, a consortium of
      U.N. agencies and more than 40 international and indigenous
      non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide emergency relief and
      rehabilitation assistance in Sudan. In addition, more than 10
      international NGOs, including GOAL, Concern, and Norwegian People's
      Aid, provide humanitarian assistance outside of the OLS framework.

      The current phase of Sudan's civil war began in 1983 with fighting
      between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation
      Army/Movement. The conflict widened in 1991 when fighting erupted
      between SPLA factions in areas of the South. The 18-year civil war in
      Sudan persists on numerous fronts in both southern and northern areas
      of the country, while civilians throughout the South and the
      transitional zone (i.e., southern Kordofan and southern Blue Nile)
      continue to be adversely affected by GOS aerial bombings and forced
      displacements due to the fighting. Opposition groups are also fighting
      the GOS in eastern Sudan. Since 1999, oil drilling and exploration in
      western Upper Nile, as well as piping crude oil to the Red Sea for
      export, has increased displacement further.
