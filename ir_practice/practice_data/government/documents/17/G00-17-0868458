                                             Office of the Press Secretary
                                                           January 2, 2002

   President Approves Tariff Preferences
   Statement by the Deputy Press Secretary

   On December 31, 2001, President Bush approved the designation of the
   following 35 Sub-Saharan African countries as eligible for tariff
   preferences under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA): Benin;
   Botswana; Cameroon; Cape Verde; Central African Republic; Chad;
   Republic of the Congo; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Gabon; Ghana;
   Guinea; Guinea-Bissau; Kenya; Lesotho; Madagascar; Malawi; Mali;
   Mauritania; Mauritius; Mozambique; Namibia; Niger; Nigeria; Rwanda; S?o
   Tome and Principe; Senegal; Seychelles; Sierra Leone; South Africa;
   Swaziland; Tanzania; Uganda; and Zambia.

   As required by the legislation, this annual determination signifies
   which countries are making continued progress toward a market-based
   economy, the rule of law, free trade, economic policies that will
   reduce poverty, and protection of workers? rights.  By providing these
   countries greater access to American markets, AGOA can spur development
   of an economic relationship between the United States and Africa that
   is based on shared values and shared responsibilities in a world of
   free trade, free peoples, and free ideas.  The Administration is
   committed to AGOA's success and to seizing the important opportunities
   the law offers us in fighting poverty and fostering development.
