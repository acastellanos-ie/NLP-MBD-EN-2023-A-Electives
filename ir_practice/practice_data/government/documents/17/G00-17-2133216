   Summary of the eRA Project Management

      The eRA Project Management Team, established in early 2000, is
      responsible for guiding and monitoring the design and implementation of
      the electronic research administration (eRA) project at the NIH. The
      Project Management Team, chaired by Dr. John McGowan, comprises
      Advocates, who represent the interests of end users and policy makers
      in business and functional areas. Jim Cain serves as eRA Implementation
      and Operations Manager. In all of its undertakings, the Project
      Management Team receives broad oversight and advice from the eRA
      Steering Committee.

      For each area of focus, the Advocate teams with an Analyst and
      developers to translate user requirements into software design
      specifications. Together, they formulate implementation plans that they
      present to the eRA Project Management Team for approval. Presentation
      of each plan to the entire team also serves to identify areas of
      overlap requiring wider participation in planning and decision-making.
      During the subsequent development phase, the Advocate and Analyst work
      cooperatively to provide guidance and oversight to the contractor and
      subcontractors.

      Throughout planning, development, testing and execution, the eRA Office
      of Planning, Analysis and Evaluation (OPAE) provides additional project
      oversight, monitoring and coordination. The OPAE also supports user
      groups and the Project Management Team by documenting and communicating
      issues, decisions, and actions through minutes, newsletters, the eRA
      website, and other vehicles.

      Current and future-year project plans and budget projections are
      submitted through the Project Management Team, Steering Committee and
      Information Technology Board of Governors (BOG) to the Funding Advisory
      Review Board (FARB) for final review, prioritization among competing
      NIH enterprise system requirements, and funding.
