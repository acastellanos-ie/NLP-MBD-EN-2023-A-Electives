     Treasury Kids Page
     This site, developed in response to the President's April 1997
     initiative on Internet-based Education, has won awards from
     Classroom Connect and Education World for educating the "young at
     heart." Treasury's mascot, "Trez" (an alley cat who lives in the
     basement), takes you to the sites he found after he pounced on a
     really big mouse and got on the Internet. Trez allows you to color
     him on-line (just click on the cat) and takes you to his favorite
     Treasury sites. Send Email to Granny

     about the functions of the government agencies, forms that need to
     be filed, and the benefits of paying various taxes. The pages
     include an interactive "game" that allows the child to start a
     business , make money, hire employees and pay taxes. The pages have
     three additional sections that provide education on the tax and wage
     related forms, the function of each of the related government
     agencies and some of the benefits of various taxes.
