                                  Cloud Radar IOP
                             April 2 - April 22, 1997

      The objectives of the Cloud Radar IOP are to:
        * support the calibration of the ARM millimeter cloud radar and
          evaluate the spatial versus temporal variability of cloud
          properties as seen by cloud radars,
        * obtain in-situ measurements of cloud properties to validate
          retrieval algorithms, and
        * obtain in-situ measurements of aerosol properties during clear-sky
          conditions.

      The ETL Radar Meteorology and Oceanography Division will field their
      NOAA/K scanning cloud radar near the new ARM millimeter cloud profiling
      radar (mmCR) at the ARM SGP Central Facility. At times, both cloud
      radars will operate in the vertically-pointing mode for purposes of
      evaluating and perfecting the performance of the ARM mmCR. At other
      times, the excellent scanning capabilities of the NOAA/K will be
      employed to examine how well the temporal variability of cloudiness
      measured by the ARM mmCR, which is vertically-pointing only, is related
      to the horizontal variability of cloudiness and cloud geometry. In-situ
      measurements of hydrometeor sizes and concentrations will be made by
      the University of North Dakota Citation aircraft , which is capable of
      sampling both low and high altitude clouds. The PNNL Gulfstream-1
      aircraft will concurrently sample low clouds whenever low and high
      clouds are present over the Central Facility. Spiral and stair-step
      flight paths through the cloud layers directly over or near (within 10
      to 50 km of) the Central Facility in a variety of cloud conditions will
      be necessary for validating microphysical retrievals. The Gulfstream
      aircraft will also fly aerosol missions over the site in clear-sky
      conditions, as more fully described in the Aerosol IOP home page.
