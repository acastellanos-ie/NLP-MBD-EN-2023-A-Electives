                             NETSCAPE 6.x USERS
                          POTENTIAL VIEWING ISSUES

   For those of you that have downloaded and installed Netscape 6.x - be
       advised that the banner, and some other things on our website may
       not work for you where applets are used. We do know that the latest
       versions of Netscape Communicator in the 4x series work fine and
       produce acceptable viewing of the banner and other scripted items.
