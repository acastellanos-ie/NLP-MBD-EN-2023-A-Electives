   Satellites provide nearly global coverage of the Earth with spatial
   resolutions and repetition rates that vary from one platform to
   another. Remote sensing research in the branch includes the use of
   satellite data for estimating atmospheric water vapor, trace gases,
   aerosol particles, clouds, and precipitation. In addition, satellite
   data are used to study the radiative and dynamical processes that
   affect the climate of the Earth. Branch scientists also participate in
   the design of future satellite systems.

   Satellite observations are used to study the distribution of ozone and
   water vapor. These trace gases have a significant greenhouse effect.
   Ozone affects the intensity of the UV radiation on the Earth's surface.
   Ozone measurements from the TOMS ultraviolet radiometer on NASA's
   Nimbus 7 satellite are being collected and compared with ozone
   measurements from the TOVS infrared radiometer on NOAA's weather
   satellites, and the ground-based Dobson ozone spectrometer network.

   Satellite observations made with the multispectral, dual-polarization
   microwave radiometers, SMMR and SSM/I, have enabled the mapping of
   columnar water vapor distribution over the global oceans since 1979. In
   addition, upper air water vapor is observed in the 6.7 micrometer band
   from NOAA polar orbiters. These measurements have revealed new
   information regarding the evolution and development of events such as
   El Nino Southern Oscillations, consistent with results based on in situ
   and analyzed data. Analysis of the microwave data also has yielded
   valuable information on rainfall rates over the oceans.

   NOAA-AVHRR data are used for remote sensing of biomass burning in the
   tropics, to study the interaction of smoke particles with clouds, and
   the impact of the smoke particles and the associated trace gases on
   climate. Fires are detected in teh 3.75 micrometer channel, aerosol
   concentration and cloud reflectance in the 0.64 micrometer channel.
   Cloud drop size is derived from the cloud reflectance in the 3.75
   micrometer channel. Using the ratio between the emission of aerosol
   particles and trace gases, the remotely sensed aerosol is used to
   estimate the total emission of trace gases. Satellite observations of
   the effect of smoke particles on thousands of cumulus and stratocumulus
   clouds in the Amazon basin showed that smoke reduced the cloud drop
   size by 40 percent. In contrast, to the increase in cloud albedo
   observed along ship tracks, the albedo of these clouds decreased.

   High-resolution satellite data (Landsat) are used to detect the spatial
   properties of broken cloud fields. These properties are important for
   the understanding of radiative processes in clouds. For example, in an
   analysis of the distribution of cloud area, it was found that the cloud
   field can be described by two power functions. This finding can provide
   a useful tool for classification of clouds.

   Multi-channel, 1Km resolution NOAA-AVHRR data sets are collected and
   archived in the branch for use in the retrieval of cloud parameters.
   The present cloud cover processing system utilizes all five AVHRR
   channels to provice cloud amount, cloud optical thickness, cloud top
   temperature, and an index indicative of the phase and size of the cloud
   particles. These parameters provide the basic information needed to
   develop models of cloud processes, which ultimately will be
   incorporated into climate models.
