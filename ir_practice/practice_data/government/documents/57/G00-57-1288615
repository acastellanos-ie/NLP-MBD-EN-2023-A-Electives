           Federal Professional Development Program (Security 21)
                                   History
     Numbers of professionally qualified and experienced safeguards and
   security personnel within the Department of Energy (DOE) are currently
   diminishing. To understand the impact on the Department DOE and arrive
       at a solution, the Office of Security and Emergency Operations
       conducted a study of what was has been dubbed a "human capital
   shortfall." This study projected that, by FY06, 75 percent of existing
    security professionals would be eligible for retirement. In addition,
   with diminishing federal resources, a professional development program
    to address critical technical skills with a standardized methodology
   was determined to be vital to DOE's success. Options for a solution all
   pointed to the need for a comprehensive career development program for
      security professionals. The Security 21 Professional Development
                           Program was the result.

     The National Nuclear Security Administration has taken a leadership
      role with the Office of Security and Emergency Operations in the
   development of a pilot program designed to meet projected human capital
               shortfalls. More partnerships are anticipated.

                                   Purpose
