   The Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) is a small sophisticated camera, which
   from Earth orbit, will detect and produce images of the ultraviolet
   light of the aurora, day and night. As such, it is one of eleven
   instruments onboard the Polar spacecraft, which is the second mission
   of NASA's Global Geospace Science (GGS) Program.
