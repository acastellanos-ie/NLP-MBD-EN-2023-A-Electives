   Biography of your DAE:

      Im originally from Northern California, and grew up in Sacramento until
      moving to Washington State in 1988. While in Sacramento, I earned my
      Airframe and Powerplant ticket, and moved to Washington to look for
      employment in aerospace. I hired on with Boeing in Everett in 1989, and
      have been there ever since. Im now an investigator for the Airline
      Concerns Team, conducting investigations into in-service quality issues
      for our airline customers. I now live in the Lake Goodwin area,
      northwest of Marysville, Washington.
      [garlow.jpg] Aerospace has been an intense hobby of mine ever since
      that first trip to the airport during my childhood. My artwork is
      driven by aviation, and I am in the process of setting up a lithograph
      business on the internet to sell my work. My art has also given me the
      opportunity to be a team member for the North American Eagle race team,
      which is seeking to reclaim the supersonic land speed record for North
      America. See more at www.landspeed.com.
      I am also active in the restoration of the DeHavilland Comet 4C at the
      Museum of Flight Restoration Center at Paine Field, Washington. I am
      restoring and painting parts for the cockpit and other areas of the
      aircraft. For more information on this project, go to www.dhcomet.org.

      I hold a brown belt in Shito Ryu Karate, having been instructed at the
      Family Karate Ronin Dojo in Marysville, WA. So, you could say Im busy.

      I was asked to take the position of Director of Aerospace Education for
      Washington Wing in July of 2000. I have found it to be a challenging
      and rewarding job. I certainly have found a great deal of support from
      some truly dedicated folks. I am fortunate to have two of those people
      on my staff at Wing. 1Lt. Patrick Smith is my Internal AEO, and Capt.
      Pam Grossman is my External AEO.
