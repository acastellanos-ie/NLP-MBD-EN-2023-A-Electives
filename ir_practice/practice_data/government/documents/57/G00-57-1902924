   Excerpts of Ambassador Baker interview

      The Following are excerpts from U.S. Ambassador Howard Baker's
      Interview with The Japan Times:
      Tokyo, January 1, 2002

      Ambassador Baker

      "Q. How do you think the Sept. 11 tragedy has strengthened relations
      between Japan and the United States?
      A. It is clear that it has brought our countries even closer together.
      Your prime minister and your Diet have acted expeditiously and
      effectively in constructing the means for Japan to join in this combat
      (against) international terrorism. . . . It is clear from many
      standpoints that the long-lived friendship between Japan and the U.S.
      is even deeper and broader now than it was before the terrible
      incidents of Sept. 11."
