                          Guidelines For Using the
                           Year Of The Ocean Logo
                             (Adobe PDF Version)
                               (Text Version)

     The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department
     of Commerce ("NOAA" or "Licensor") has adopted and is using the
     official Year of the Ocean ("YOTO") logo ("logo"), and is in the
     process of registering the logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
     Office as a trademark and service mark; and

     In consideration of the mutual agreements below, it is agreed that:
   1. Quality Control: NOAA will have the right, at all reasonable times,
       to inspect the Licensee's goods, services and promotional
       activities employing the logo to ensure that such use is of proper
       quality and otherwise consistent with this Agreement.

     2. Duration and Termination: This Agreement shall terminate on
     December 31, 1998. However, this Agreement may be extended by mutual
     consent of the Parties for a reasonable amount of time thereafter in
     order for the Licensee to complete activities and/or to exhaust
     existing stocks of inventory bearing the logo.

     3. Assignments and Sub-Licenses: This License is not assignable, and
     any attempt by the Licensee to assign any portion of the License or
     to grant a sub-license shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement
     and shall be cause for termination.

       4. Use of Mark:

   (A) The Year of the Ocean logo is available for use by Federal
       agencies, non-profit or corporate organizations carrying out
       research, education and management work that relates to the general
       goals and objectives of YOTO which are as follows: outreach and
       education, research, assessing the condition of the marine
       environment, or leading sustainable management efforts.

     (B) In order to prevent misuse of the YOTO logo, an application form
     must be completed and forwarded, together with any other relevant
     information, by mail, fax, or email to the contact below. The
     application is hereby incorporated by reference into this Trademark
     License Agreement.

     (C) The use of the logo shall be done in such a way so that there
     does not exist any appearance of Government endorsement,
     authorization or affiliation of the Licensor with the Licensee.

   General Guidelines for Reproduction

   To ensure the correct and consistent display of the logo, it is
   important to use, wherever possible, the digitized image files that
   will be provided on diskette. If you do not have the resources to
   reproduce the logo from an image file, please state this on your
   application and an alternative will be provided. Working from
   photocopies, other printed materials, or scanned images should be
   avoided as this may result in poor quality reproduction.

   The logo should be used in positive, not reverse, and outline versions
   must not be used. The logo must not be distorted - any scaling of image
   files must be performed equally on the entire image. There should
   always be sufficient contrast between the logo, and the background and
   the trademark (TM) symbol must always be included. If you are intending
   to print using a color other than black or blue, please submit details
   on your application.

   When the logo has become registered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark
   Office, the Licensee in using the logo shall clearly indicate that it
   is Federally registered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office and
   that it is the property of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Such
   indication of registration shall be in the form of the "&REG;"
   designation, including, where possible, the words "the 'Year of the
   Ocean' logo is a Federally registered trademark of the U.S. Department
   of Commerce."
