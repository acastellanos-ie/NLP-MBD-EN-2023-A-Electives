   USGS NSDI Node

About the USGS Geospatial Data Clearinghouse
     __________________________________________________________________

  Introduction

   The USGS node of the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse is a
   component of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The
   Clearinghouse provides a pathway to find information about geospatial
   or spatially referenced data available from USGS. The information is in
   the form of metadata. Metadata or "data about data" describe the
   content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data.
   Metadata are used to organize and maintain investments in data, to
   provide information to data catalogs and clearinghouses, and to aid
   data transfers. This site is maintained by the USGS in cooperation with
   the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).

   The USGS NSDI node actually encompasses a distributed set of sites
   organized on the basis of the USGS's four principal data themes:

        Biological Resources Information    Geologic Information
          National Mapping Information   Water Resources Information

  Finding Data

   Browsing is like going to a section of the library and looking at
   what's on the shelf. It's a good way to get a general idea of the types
   of information available. The links below will help you become familiar
   with the wide array geospatial data products produced or maintained by
   the USGS. When you find a particular data set you want to examine more
   closely, the pages contain links to let you see its metadata.
     * "Best Sellers" -- A quick guide to some of the most popular USGS
       geospatial data products.
     * Product Category -- An alphabetic listing of all major categories
       of USGS geospatial data products.
     * Theme -- USGS geospatial data products organized by topic.

   Searching is the equivalent of using the library's card catalog. It's
   the most efficient method of examining available online USGS geospatial
   data holdings to find the information you want. You can search for USGS
   (and other organizations') geospatial data holdings by keyword or, if
   you can identify a particular geographic area of interest, by its
   latitude and longitude boundaries. The capability to search for data
   online by keyword or area of interest is provided by USGS and other
   National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse Gateways.

  Obtaining Data

   Once you discover a record of the data you want, you can examine their
   metadata files which contain instructions for actually obtaining the
   data.. Some data sets are available online at no cost. For others, you
   may need to set up an account to pay a distribution fee. Some data sets
   are not online and you will be instructed how to order a compact disk
   or a tape.

   Many USGS geospatial data products, such as Digital Elevation Models
   (DEM's) and Digital Line Graphs (DLG's) are available in the Spatial
   Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) format, a Federal standard to ensure data
   compatibility with the software needed to process and use them. Others
   are in more specialized formats, which are described in their metadata.
   Whenever you retrieve a data set, it is important to retrieve the
   associated metadata as well, since the metadata provides important
   information for using the data set. The browser software you are using
   to view this page probably is able to view and print the metadata
   files, or to save them locally on your computer for later use.

  Viewing Data

   USGS digital data products are designed to be read and used by
   geographic information systems (GIS), image processing systems, or
   similar computer applications. To use any geospatial data that you
   purchase or download from the USGS, you will need to obtain appropriate
   software from commercial or other sources if you do not already have
   it. More information about geographic information systems can be
   obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey or the National Center for
   Geographic Information and Analysis. A comprehensive list of World Wide
   Web sites serving GIS information can be found at the University of
   Edinburgh.
