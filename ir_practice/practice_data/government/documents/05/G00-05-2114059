     Welcome



     The Research and Development (R&D) program serves as the foundation
     that supports the Agency's goal to reduce motor vehicle injuries and
     fatalities.
     Through extensive research, development, testing, crash investigation,
     and data collection and analysis activities, R&D provides the
     scientific strength needed to support the Agency's motor vehicle and
     traffic safety goals.

    Research projects are conducted under an overall plan to meet Agency
     goals. To enable tracking the status of on-going research projects,
         summaries are provided here and will be updated quarterly.
   The project summaries are being added as they become available and most
     are expected in the near future. Each summary contains the name of
    project leader(s) and appropriate e-mail address and/or phone number,
    if you wish to contact someone for further information. It's planned
            that at some point the summaries will be searchable.
    General questions regarding this page should be directed to Gary Bell
                            via Internet e-mail.
