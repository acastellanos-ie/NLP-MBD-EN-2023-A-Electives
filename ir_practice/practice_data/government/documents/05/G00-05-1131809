   NIST DASE Development Environment DASE 2001 Symposium News

   The NIST DASE Development Environment is a collaboration effort of the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Advanced
   Television Systems Committee (ATSC) T3/S17 industry consortium for the
   proposed Digital TV Applications Software Environment (DASE) standard.
   The Distributed Systems Technology group is directing their efforts
   towards the development of an ATSC Set-top Box simulation, a prototype
   implementation of the DASE Procedural Application Environment (PAE)
   Application Programming Interface (API) and reference applications. A
   working prototype of the NIST DASE Development Environment is available
   at this site. The environment can be used to test the core
   functionality provided by the DASE specification for Xlets. NIST has
   written and tested example STB native applications and DASE Xlets using
   the NIST DASE prototype implementation. All NIST produced source code,
   documents, and associated products are in the public domain and are
   available at this site.

   The NIST DASE PAE API prototype implementation is intended as a tool to
   (1) demonstrate proof of concept of the DASE standard, (2) provide the
   impetus for conformance testing, (3) aid the design and development of
   other DASE implementations, and (4) provide an environment for
   developing and testing DASE contents/applications.

   The NIST PAE API implementation is a prototype, as such, not all
   functionality is implemented and the completed sections of the
   implementation may not reflect the intended semantics of the DASE
   specification.

   The DASE 2001 Symposium was held June 19-20, 2001 at the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD. The
   event is co-sponsored by the Advanced Television Systems Committee
   (ATSC) and NIST.

   Upcoming ATSC DTV Seminar
   The ATSC in cooperation with the Society of Broadcast Engineers and
   NIST presents Charting the Future of DTV, sponsored by Tandberg
   Television, Harmonic & Decisionmark. The seminar will be held in St.
   Louis, Missouri, February 20-21, 2002.
