      Divisions / Research Areas
          The Physics Laboratory is divided into six major divisions,
          described below. Also see:
          Major Research Facilities
          Seminars / Meetings

   -     Electron & Optical Physics: develops measurement methods and
     associated technology for determining electron and photon interactions
                                  with matter.

   - Atomic Physics: carries out a broad program of long-term experimental
                   and theoretical research in atomic physics.

   - Optical Technology: promotes accurate and useful optical radiation
          measurements in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectral
                                    regions.

   - Ionizing Radiation: provides national leadership in fundamental
     research and measurement standards for all types of ionizing radiation.

   -   Time & Frequency: is responsible for the standards of time and
      frequency; and since length is now derived from the second, develops
                          optical frequency standards.

   - Quantum Physics: conducts research in atomic and chemical physics,
              precision measurement, and laser and optical physics.

                      NIST Physicist Wins Nobel Prize!
   Eric Cornell of NIST and Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado are
   winners of the 2001 Nobel Prize in physics along with Wolfgang Ketterle
      of MIT. They are recognized "for the achievement of Bose-Einstein
   condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental
               studies of the properties of the condensates."
