   The Flexible Image Transport System, or FITS, is the format adopted by
   the astronomical community for data interchange and archival storage.
   The FITS Support Office is responsible for documenting the FITS
   standard, participating in its evolution, and advising NASA
   astrophysics missions on how to present their data in FITS format. For
   further information about the FITS community and FITS announcements,

  Redefinition of DATE-OBS keyword encompassing the millennium

     * announcement of approval by IAU FITS Working Group
     * text of agreement
     * appendix suggesting conventions for time scale specification (not
       part of formal agreement)

   On November 10, the IAU FITS Working Group approved a definition for
   the format of the value field of DATE-OBS and other keywords beginning
   with the string DATE that contain date and possible time information.
   This format provides four digits for the year number, thus providing an
   explicit specification of the century in all dates.
