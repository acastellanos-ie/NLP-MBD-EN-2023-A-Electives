   __________________________________________________________________

   The primary objectives of the Meats Research Unit are to reduce the
   risk of foodborne illness associated with the consumption of red meat,
   to respond to the research needs of the Food Safety and Inspection
   Service of the USDA, to increase efficiency of lean meat production,
   and to improve eating quality of meat. Food safety research addresses
   the microbial status of the meat from slaughter to table using both
   molecular and standard microbiological techniques. Unique methods are
   developed and validated for sampling carcasses and trim, and for
   isolating and identifying pathogens that may be present. Molecular
   techniques are used to track contamination to its source, in order to
   discover additional hurdles that will decrease the transfer of
   pathogens to the carcass. Factors that affect the survival and recovery
   of pathogens in stored and cooked meat products, as well as on
   refrigerated beef carcasses, are examined. Special emphasis is placed
   on improving intervention strategies and developing new, directed
   strategies designed to decrease pathogen contamination of red meat
   without adversely affecting meat quality. All of the information
   acquired will be integrated into forms usable by the meat industry as
   part of HACCP plans. Meat quality research is directed toward
   identifying key steps in the regulation of muscle protein breakdown
   during growth and during postmortem storage. Special emphasis is placed
   on the identification of areas of the genome that regulate carcass
   composition and meat quality, the development of methodologies to
   classify carcasses based on tenderness and lean meat yield, the effect
   of breed on carcass composition and meat quality, and the development
   of intervention technologies to optimize meat tenderness.

   Current Projects:

   Title: Control of Pathogenic and Spoilage Bacteria on Red Meat

     Objectives:

     Develop antimicrobial intervention strategies for slaughter,
     processing, and fabrication, and determine intervention effects on
     microbial safety, spoilage, and ecology of the resulting products
     (e.g., carcass, subprimal, trim, ground beef).

     Develop representative sampling procedures and sensitive, accurate,
     and rapid diagnostic methods to detect foodborne pathogens and other
     microbial contaminants.

     Determine the effects of previous environment and/or intervention
     procedures on the induction of adaptive responses in bacteria that
     result in increased antimicrobial resistance and/or virulence.

     Determine and characterize molecular mechanisms of pathogen
     resistance and virulence development, and develop procedures to
     prevent these occurrences.

   Title: Develop On-Line Verification and Intervention Procedures for
   HACCP in Slaughter/Processing Systems

     Objectives:

     Develop practical antimicrobial intervention strategies for
     slaughter, processing, and fabrication that maintain product
     quality.

     Develop improved sampling, detection, and identification methods for
     monitoring and verification of Critical Control Points (CCPs).

     Determine and characterize molecular mechanisms and sources of
     pathogen virulence acquisition, and develop procedures to prevent
     these occurrences.

     Investigate genomic and virulence characteristics of pathogens and
     apply this information to the elimination of pathogens from the meat
     supply.

   Title: Strategies to optimize carcass yield and meat quality of red
   meat animals

     Objectives:

     Identify genetic markers for carcass composition and meat
     tenderness.

     Develop tenderness-based beef classification technologies.

     Obtain the necessary information to manipulate the systems
     regulating muscle growth and meat tenderness.

     Develop genetic and postmortem strategies to improve lean meat yield
     and meat palatability.

     Evaluate effects of breeds representing diverse biological types on
     carcass composition and meat quality.
