      The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) serves as a
   national critical infrastructure threat assessment, warning,
   vulnerability, and law enforcement investigation and response entity.
   The NIPC provides timely warnings of international threats,
   comprehensive analysis and law enforcement investigation and response.
   The mission of the NIPC is to:
     * detect, deter, assess, warn, respond, and investigate unlawful acts
       involving computer and information technologies and unlawful acts,
       both physical and cyber, that threaten or target our critical
       infrastructures;
     * manage computer intrusion investigations;
     * support law enforcement, counterterrorism, and foreign
       counterintelligence missions related to cyber crimes and intrusion;
     * support national security authorities when unlawful acts go beyond
       crime and are foreign-sponsored attacks on United States interests;
       and
     * coordinate training for cyber investigators and infrastructure
       protectors in government and the private sector.
