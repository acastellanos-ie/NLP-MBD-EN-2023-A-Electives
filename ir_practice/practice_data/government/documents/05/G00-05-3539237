   Evaluating the Effects of Urbanization and Land-Use Planning Using
   Ground-Water and Surface-Water Models
   The city of Middleton, Wisconsin, and its surroundings are developing
   and planners are concerned with the effect this development may have on
   stream baseflow and spring flows. The USGS, in cooperation with the
   city and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, completed a
   study that helps address these issues through modeling of the
   hydrologic system.
