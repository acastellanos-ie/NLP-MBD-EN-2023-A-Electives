   Welcome

   CSM Purpose:

   The Commission on State Mandates carries out three distinct statutory
   responsibilities: First, the Commission adjudicates test claims of
   local entities that allege the existence of reimbursable state-mandated
   programs. Second, the Commission hears and decides claims that the
   Controller has incorrectly reduced payments for reimbursement claims.
   Third, the Commission determines the existence of significant financial
   distress for applicant counties that seek to reduce their general
   assistance standards of aid.
