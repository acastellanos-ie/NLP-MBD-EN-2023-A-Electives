   Turner syndrome affects approximately 1 out of every 2,500 female live
   births worldwide. It embraces a broad spectrum of features, from major
   heart defects to minor cosmetic issues. Some individuals with Turner
   syndrome may have only a few features, while others may have many.
   Almost all people with Turner syndrome have short stature and loss of
   ovarian function, but the severity of these problems varies
   considerably amongst individuals.
