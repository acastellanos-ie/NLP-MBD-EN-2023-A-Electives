              On June 27, 2000 BTeV received Stage I approval.

   With the commissioning of the Main Injector, the Fermilab Tevatron will
   produce more than 400 billion b-flavored hadrons per year and 10 times
   as many c-flavored hadrons per year. These heavy flavored hadrons will
   be an excellent resource with which to investigate CP violation,
   quark/anti-quark mixing and rare decays. Our goal is to exploit this
   tremendous physics potential during and before the LHC era. BTeV is
   well positioned to answer the most crucial questions in heavy flavor
   physics.
