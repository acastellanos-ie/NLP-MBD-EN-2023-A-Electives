                                  WebWinds

    [new14.jpg] The WebWinds client and server package (DOVE) was selected
       for honorable mention in NASA's Software of the Year competition.
    [new14.jpg] Download the latest (4.00) release of WebWinds, including
       documentation containing information on what's new.
    [new14.jpg] Webwinds now does distributed processing allowing direct
       data access via a data server.
       WebWinds is an interactive science data visualization system,
       written in Java and  available for all major computer platforms.
       Its use does not require any user programming experience since
       sessions are created by assembling components on the screen via
       'point and click'.  WebWinds is modular, allowing flexibility in
       tool construction and application. This version allows
       internet-based distributed processing for the first time so that it
       can fulfill the needs of data providers as well as data consumers.
       You can view a paper (Elson et al., 2000, Bulletin of the American
       Meteorological Society: Vol. 81, No. 3, pp. 555-566.) describing
       the project and its goals.
       WebWinds is largely platform and operating system independent so
       that it functions efficiently in today's heterogeneous environment.
       The current release has been tested under Windows 95/98/2000/NT,
       Mac OS X, Linux, IRIX and Solaris.  Because Apple will not produce
       a version of Java 2 for Mac OS 7-9, these users must use WebWinds
       version 3.03 . This means that there may be some loss of
       functionality including the ability to communicate with data
       servers  running version 4.xx. Users report success using WebWinds
       under FreeBSD and AIX operating systems.
       The WebWinds user interface uses a direct manipulation approach in
       that it employs continuous representation of displays and controls
       requiring physical actions rather than complex syntax. The benefits
       of this approach are that it allows rapid response to operations
       with immediately visible effects.
       Currently, the main features of WebWinds are:
          + The ability to present and manipulate 2 and 3 dimensional data
            in a variety of 1 and 2 dimensional display tools
          + The ability to subset and sub-sample data on input or display
            output, making it possible to handle very large data sets.
          + The ability to concatenate or combine data sets to create a
            higher order data set.
          + The ability to overlay tabular data on top of images.
          + The ability to display several types of coordinate projections
            for some types of data.
          + Simultaneous display and analysis of multiple data sets which
            may be totally unrelated.
          + Interactive color manipulation.
          + The ability to act as a Web browser helper application, making
            it possible to survey scientific data archives in interactive
            mode.
          + Ability to save sub-setted or sub-sampled data.
          + A scripting language which allows session configuration,
            re-run, macros, network collaboration and distributed
            processing.
          + A context sensitive help system.
          + The ability to save images from the screen to a file,
            including animated movies.
          + Complete, free installation programs (including Java) for most
            platforms.
          + A server software package which allows remote data access,
            sub-setting and sub-sampling.
          + 3D rendered displays capable of depicting an image in
            perspective using lighting and shading:

       Here's a movie showing altitude data from the Mars Orbiter Laser
       Altimeter. Here's one showing EOS-MISR data. Note: you will need a
       Quicktime client to view these movies.
       After you've downloaded and installed WebWinds, come back to our
       scripts page to download setup scripts for several sessions using
       data sets from around the world. Click on a script and a session
       will be set up automatically. Note that these scripts are
       incompatible with earlier releases of WebWinds and earlier scripts
       may not work with this version.
       Download the latest (4.00) release of WebWinds, including
       documentation.
       Although contained in the download package, you can now view a
       tutorial as well as several step by step examples that include
       screen shots.
