         Global Change Research-Earth Surface Dynamics

   Earth Surface Dynamics

      The earth's surface does not exist in a static, unchanging "natural"
      condition interrupted only by the work of humans, but instead it is a
      dynamic system of which humans are a part. Knowledge about changes to
      the Earth's surface and the underlying processes that induce them has
      enormous impact on how society responds to these changes and,
      ultimately, the cost of responding to change. USGS Global Change
      Research activities strive to achieve a whole-system understanding of
      the interrelationships among earth surface processes, ecological
      systems, and human activities. Activities of the program focus on
      documenting, analyzing, and modeling the character of past and present
      environments and the geological, biological, hydrological, and
      geochemical processes involved in environmental change so that future
      environmental changes and impacts can be anticipated.
