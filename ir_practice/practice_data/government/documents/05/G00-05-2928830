       _______________________________________________________________

   [paslab.jpg] The Mississippi  Laboratories were established in 1950
   under the Department of Interior as a Bureau of Commercial  Fisheries
   field station. In 1970, the  laboratory was transferred to the
   Department of Commerce,  National  Oceanic and  Atmospheric
   Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service.
   The Mississippi Laboratories consists of two main branches:

   Resource Surveys: conducts vessel, submersible, and aircraft surveys of
   fish, endangered species, and marine mammals.

   Harvesting and Engineering: conducts gear research to achieve
   conservation objectives, improve operating efficiencies and develop new
   fisheries; and conducts research to improve effectiveness of sampling
   systems and to apply satellite technology to fisheries. This branch
   includes staff at the Stennis Space Center facility.

   The Pascagoula Facilities are also home to a National Seafood
   Inspection Laboratory and the NOAA Office of Marine and Aviation
   Operations. The NOAA Office of Marine and Aviation Operations operates
   two  NOAA research vessels stationed at Pascagoula, the Oregon II and
   the Gordon Gunter. The Mississippi Laboratories research activities are
   in  response to resource management, environmental and utilization
   needs ,and are by design , inherently  responsive  to various
   legislative  and  fishing  industry  needs throughout the southeast
   region.
