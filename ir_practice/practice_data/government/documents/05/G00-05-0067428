                            PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   The Metropolitan Medical Response System program was originated in 1996
   and is managed by the Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP). The
   primary focus of the MMRS program is to develop or enhance existing
   emergency preparedness systems to effectively manage a weapons of mass
   destruction (WMD) incident. This includes both biological and chemical
   threats. The goal is to coordinate the efforts of local law
   enforcement, fire, hazmat, EMS, hospital, public health and other
   personnel to improve response capabilities in the event of a terrorist
   attack. By the end of year 2002, 120 jurisdictions across the United
   States will have implemented MMRS plans into their communities. Click
