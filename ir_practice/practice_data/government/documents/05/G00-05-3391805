   Employment of Relatives of NINDS Employees in the NINDS Student
   Programs
   Relatives of NINDS employees and staff members may not be appointed
   into NINDS Student Programs. The term relatives, as defined by the NIH
   Nepotism policy, includes aunt, sister, brother, brother-in-law,
   daughter, daughter-in-law, father, father-in-law, first cousin,
   grandchild, grandparent, half brother, half sister, legal guardian,
   mother, mother-in-law, nephew, niece, stepfather, stepmother,
   stepsister, stepson, uncle and close, personal relationships between
   consenting persons who share the same household. This policy includes
   the NINDS Summer Program, NINDS Student Temporary Employment Program
   (STEP), and the NINDS  Intramural Research Training Agreement (IRTA)
   program.

   The reason for such a policy is that NINDS has many more applicants
   than positions to be filled.  The selection of a relative of an NINDS
   employee could give the perception that the selection was made on the
   basis of nepotism, i.e. favoritism shown or patronage granted to
   relatives.  Secondly, the employment of a relative of an NINDS employee
   brings additional pressures on the employing supervisor or organization
   regarding possible awards or problems.  In short, the management
   problems that are brought about by such an appointment can become very
   complex.

   The NINDS Student policy does not prevent the relatives of NINDS
   employees from being hired elsewhere at the NIH just as any other
   applicant might be hired.

   School Enrollment Requirement
   Students desiring to participate in the NINDS STEP must be enrolled in
   school on a full-time basis (or have been accepted for enrollment) in
   an accredited high school, technical, or vocational school, 2 or 4 year
   college or university, or graduate and professional school.  The
   student must be working towards a diploma, degree, certificate, etc.
   Any student enrolled in high school will be considered a full-time
   student.  While employed, students must maintain an acceptable school
   standing.

   Citizenship
   The program is open to citizens and non-citizens who:
   (1) have permanent visa status
   (2) are from a country allied with the U.S.A., (List of treaty-allied
   countries)
   (3) have lawfully been admitted to the U.S. as a permanent resident
   (4) are authorized to be employed by the Federal Government

   Age
   Students must be at least 16 years of age.

                       Work Assignments and Schedules

   Students, who are accepted into the NINDS STEP, work
   part-time (approximately 20 hours per week).  Full-time work schedules
   (up to 40 hours per week) may be available during school breaks and
   summer vacation.  The student's work schedule should not interfere with
   the student's academic schedule.
