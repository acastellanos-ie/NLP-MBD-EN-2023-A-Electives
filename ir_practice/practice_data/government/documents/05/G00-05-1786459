   STATE OF THE UNION
   Congressman Dreier applauded the President's State of the Union address
   saying, "The three goals outlined by the President - winning the war on
   terror, securing the homeland, and creating jobs - are the three most
   important fights we will wage in the months and years ahead. A robust
   economy will be key to fighting global terrorism and preventing another
   attack. As the President said, the threat is out there. We must remain
   vigilant and stay prepared."

   A NEW ERA FOR AIR TRAVEL
   September 11 changed everything. We've all heard that phrase, but it
   bears repeating. The new federal guidelines regarding airport security
   that took effect January 18, remind us that traveling in this country
   will be different in 2002. Deterring a new breed of would-be terrorists
   requires a new vigilance in passenger and baggage screening. While
   improving airport security isn't a mandate for inconvenience, increased
   security will go a long way toward restoring peace of mind for
   Americans. These new measures will serve as a potent response to those
   who believe the threat of terrorism can stifle our freedom to travel as
   we choose.

   TAKING STOCK, LOOKING AHEAD
   Congress began 2001 with an extensive to-do list. Our top priorities
   included passage of the Presidents plan for comprehensive education
   reform, tax relief for all working Americans and renewal of Trade
   Promotion Authority. The events of September 11th did not lessen our
   commitment to these important issues. The 107th Congress not only took
   swift action to address homeland security, provide aid to New York,
   Virginia and Pennsylvania, and support the Presidents war on terrorism,
   we also remained dedicated to the domestic concerns of Americans.

   NATIONAL DEFENSE
   Calling its passage, a clear indication of Americas resolve to defeat
   terrorism and defend freedom, Congressman Dreier voted to approve
   defense funding and additional funds needed in the wake of the
   September 11th attacks. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act
   Conference Report, H.R. 3338, provides FY02 funding for defense and
   intelligence activities, and contains $20 billion in supplemental
   spending for homeland security.

   ECONOMIC STIMULUS
   Saying it was "past time we did something to jump start our foundering
   economy and help Americans that are hurting," Congressman Dreier voted
   for legislation aimed at helping the unemployed and bringing our
   economy out of recession. The Worker Assistance and Economic Recovery
   Act of 2001, H.R. 3529, was approved in the House with bipartisan
   support, 224-193.
