   HRSA directs programs that improve the Nation's health by expanding
   access to comprehensive, quality health care for all Americans.

   Through its four Bureaus (key program areas), HRSA works to improve and
   extend life for people living with HIV/AIDS, provide primary health
   care to medically underserved people, serve women and children through
   State programs, and train a health workforce that is both diverse and
   motivated to work in underserved communities.

   The Access Agency's accomplishments for the past fiscal year are
   detailed in the latest HRSA Annual Report.
