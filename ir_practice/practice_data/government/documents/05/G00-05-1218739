   Comprehensive Assessment of Public Information Dissemination Released
   by US National Commission On Libraries and Information Science

   February 06, 2001 --According to the report, government agencies are
   trying to use the World Wide Web to ensure availability of information,
   but not all needed information is available on the Internet nor do
   users of public information necessarily have the professional skills to
   use what is available in any format. Also, government information made
   available electronically can disappear as quickly as it has appeared.
   No policy is in place for long term or permanent public access to
   web-based public information.

   Based on the findings and conclusions, the Commission is setting forth
   thirty-six recommendations.
