   PubSCIENCE provides users the capability to search across a large
   compendium of citations including abstracts of peer reviewed journal
   literature with a focus on the physical sciences and other disciplines
   of concern to the Department of Energy (DOE).

   PubSCIENCE
   is another tool developed by DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical
   Information and made available to the American public in partnership
   with the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO).  Also visit the DOE
   Information Bridge for full-text DOE Report literature and the PrePrint
   Network for a "one-stop shopping" site for preprints in science and
   technology.  OSTI's newest tool, Energy Citations Database contains
   bibliographic records for energy and energy-related scientific and
   technical information from the Department of Energy (DOE) and its
   predecessor agencies from 1948 through the present.  PubSCIENCE is a
   component of EnergyFiles Virtual Library of Energy Science and
   Technology.

                           PubSCIENCE Contributors

   PubSCIENCE  is made possible through the collaborative efforts of the
   Department of Energy and the publishers who have generously provided
   their citations and abstracts and, in some instances, full-text.
