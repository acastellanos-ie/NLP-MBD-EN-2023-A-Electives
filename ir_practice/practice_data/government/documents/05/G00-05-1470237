   Welcome to the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) information resource
   for the United States Geological Survey. Located at the Florida
   Caribbean Science Center, this site has been established as a central
   repository for accurate and spatially referenced biogeographic accounts
   of nonindigenous aquatic species. Provided are scientific reports,
   online/realtime queries, spatial data sets, regional contact lists, and
   general information. The data is made available for use by biologists,
   interagency groups, and the general public. The geographical coverage
   is the United States.
