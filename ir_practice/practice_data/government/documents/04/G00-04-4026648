   The Applied Physics (X) Division of Los Alamos National Laboratory is
   the premier national resource for information, expertise, and solutions
   involving all aspects of nuclear weapons physics and related national
   security issues. X Division has a lead role in assessing the safety and
   reliability of the enduring nuclear stockpile. We also contribute to
   analyses of emerging proliferation threats and develop response
   options.

   The Division's core technical activities lie in the areas of
   computational modeling and simulation, and physics model development,
   of complex problems requiring the coupling of multiple physical
   processes. To improve our models, we design, help field, and analyze
   laboratory experiments in extreme physical regimes. Our computer codes
   are validated against an extensive database of results from previous
   nuclear tests and other relevant experimental phenomena. Most work is
   accomplished in multidisciplinary teams.

   X-Division technical staff interact extensively with the Department of
   Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA), the
   Department of Defense (DoD), the intelligence community, other DOE
   laboratories including Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
   and Sandia National Laboratory (SNL), as well as the United Kingdom
   Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE). The staff provides expert advice to
   U.S. government agencies in support of treaty negotiations and foreign
   intractions, and operational support in response to nuclear
   emergencies. Our activities also include analyzing emerging
   proliferation threats and developing response options, and providing
   expertise in related, nondefense research programs.
