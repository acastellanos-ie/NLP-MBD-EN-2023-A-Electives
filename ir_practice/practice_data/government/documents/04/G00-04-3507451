   Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center

Welcome to the GCMRC

   The Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center (GCMRC) studies the
   effects of the operation of Glen Canyon Dam on downstream resources
   within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Grand Canyon
   National Park. The GCMRC's scientific activities contribute to meeting
   the statutory requirements placed on the Secretary of the Interior by
   Congress via the 1992 Grand Canyon Protection Act, the 1995 Glen Canyon
   Dam Environmental Impact Statement, and the 1996 Record of Decision.
   The scientific activities are performed by both in-house and external
   research experts, often in collaborative effort. The GCMRC annually
   extends a formal Solicitation for Cooperative Agreement Proposals (see
   below) to solicit additional research. Research results are used to
   refine the Conceptual Model of the impacts of differing dam operations
   on the Colorado riverine ecosystem. The GCMRC presents The State of
   Natural and Cultural Resources in the Colorado River Ecosystem Report
   (SCORE report) on a semi-annual basis.

   The GCMRC works within an Adaptive Management Program (AMP) to allow
   flexibility in research objectives in response to increased
   understanding. The GCMRC works cooperatively with the Adaptive
   Management Work Group (AMWG) to define research objectives, and is
   advised with respect to science and information needs by the Technical
   Work Group (TWG). Both groups include representatives from federal and
   state resource management agencies, Native American tribes, and a
   diverse set of research experts. Additionally, a set of Independent
   Review Panels (IRP) provides independent assessments of program
   proposals and accomplishments to ensure scientific objectivity and
   credibility.
