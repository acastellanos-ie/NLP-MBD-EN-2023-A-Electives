   The Office of the Secretary for Education is responsible for advising
   and making policy recommendations to the Governor on education issues.
   The Office of the Secretary also administers three programs: the
   Academic Volunteer and Mentor Service Program, READ California and the
   Governor's Reading Award Program. The Academic Volunteer and Mentor
   Service Program oversees grants to local mentoring programs and has as
   its goal the development of a statewide plan to match every child in
   need with an academic mentor. READ California is a statewide public
   engagement campaign to promote reading. The Governor's Reading Award
   program is a reading competition for schools with students in grades
   K-8, in which cash awards are given to schools whose students have read
   the greatest number of pages.
