                                 THE ORIGINS

   Responding to growing concerns about the nation’s ability to defend
   against weapons of mass destruction terrorism, the Attorney General of
   the United States sanctioned the creation of an interagency board to
   ensure equipment standardization and interoperability, to encourage
   research and development of advanced response technologies, and to
   assist First Responders at the state and local levels in establishing
   and maintaining a robust crisis and consequence management capability.

   The Department of Defense's Consequence Management Program Integration
   Office and Department of Justice’s Federal Bureau of Investigation
   Weapons of Mass Destruction Countermeasures Unit founded the
   InterAgency Board with its first meeting on 13 October 1998, with the
   thankful participation by various local, state, and federal government
   organizations, and immediately embarked upon a collective effort to
   standardize weapons of mass destruction response equipment.

                                 THE CHARTER

   In order to ensure standardization and interoperability throughout the
   response community, the Attorney General of the United States has
   sanctioned an interagency board consisting of officials from various
   local, state, and federal governments to develop, maintain, and update
   a national standardized equipment list (SEL) for use by the interagency
   community in preparing for and responding to weapons of mass
   destruction (WMD) terrorism.
