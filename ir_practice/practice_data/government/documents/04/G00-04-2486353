   The NOAA Corps is the smallest of the seven uniformed services of the
   United States. The service, consisting of approximately 299
   commissioned officers, is an integral part of the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U.S. Department of
   Commerce. The Director of the NOAA Corps is Rear Admiral Evelyn J.
   Fields, NOAA.

   The NOAA Commissioned Corps traces its roots back to the former U.S.
   Coast and Geodetic Survey, which dates back to 1807 and President
   Thomas Jefferson. A two-page history of the NOAA Corps is available.
   The NOAA Corps today provides a cadre of professionals trained in
   engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, meteorology, fisheries
   science, and other related disciplines. The officers serve in
   assignments within the five major Line Offices of NOAA: National Ocean
   Service (NOS), National Weather Service (NWS), National Marine
   Fisheries Service (NMFS), Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) and
   National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service
   (NESDIS). Officers operate ships, fly aircraft, lead mobile field
   parties, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and serve
   in staff positions throughout NOAA.

   Duty stations are located across the United States, including Alaska
   and Hawaii, as well as overseas at remote research sites such as the
   interior of Australia and the South Pole.

   Like other uniformed services, the NOAA Corps has its own set of
   insignia, and ribbons. The ranks within the NOAA Corps are the same as
   the U.S. Navy, from ensign to rear admiral (upper half).
