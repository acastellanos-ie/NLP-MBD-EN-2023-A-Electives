   The Energy Trends site examines trends in energy research, development,
       and investment around the world. It includes

     * crosscutting analyses that assess the adequacy of current
       investments in the light of likely future energy challenges. The
       reports reveal and explain important similarities and differences
       in energy research and development (R&D) investment trends across
       countries.
     * in-depth reports examining trends in energy R&D investment in the
       European Union and eight industrialized countries: Canada, France,
       Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the
       United States.

   A small group of advanced industrialized countries has been responsible
   for about 95% of the world's energy R&D investments. The energy R&D
   enterprises of these countries embody, to a large extent, the
   capability for future technological changes in the world's energy
   systems.

   Recently each of these countries reduced its public and private sector
   investments in energy R&D - in some cases by more than 70%. Given fewer
   resources, firms and governments find themselves compelled increasingly
   to make difficult tradeoffs between technology areas and between long-
   and short-term research projects. The changes and new directions for
   energy R&D investment and their consequences are thoroughly analyzed in
   the reports available from this site.

   International and country-specific trends in energy policy and
   investment provide information and guidance to policy-makers,
   technology managers, and others seeking to alter or reverse current
   energy R&D investment patterns. Such information will affect the
   understanding of and approach to issues of worldwide climate change.
   Because the widespread and growing use of fossil fuels is responsible
   in large part for rising global greenhouse gas emissions, addressing
   climate change will require the development and deployment of new
   energy technologies that are less carbon intensive.
