   Welcome to Our Web Site!

   Why we're in the Insurance Business: Our insurance programs were
   developed to provide insurance benefits for veterans and servicemembers
   who may not be able to get insurance from private companies because of:
     * the extra risks involved in military service
     * a service connected disability

   History of US Government involvement in insurance.
