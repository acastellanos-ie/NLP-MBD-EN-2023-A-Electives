                                Introduction.

   The following table presents space-related applications of Forth
   microprocessors and the Forth programming language, including
     * spacecraft flight system controllers
     * on-board payload experiment controllers
     * ground support systems (e.g., communications controllers and data
       processing systems)
     * hardware or software used to build or test either flight or ground
       systems.

   Developers are requested to supply table updates and corrections, as
   well as information regarding relevant projects not already included,
   as appropriate. Please send information, comments, and suggestions to
   the author of this web page. Authorization for release of the
   information is the responsibility of the contributor.

   Please notify the author concerning any non functional URLs, links, or
   contact information in the table.

   Further information on Forth, including the ANSI standard (ANS Forth):
     * Forth Interest Group
     * Taygeta
