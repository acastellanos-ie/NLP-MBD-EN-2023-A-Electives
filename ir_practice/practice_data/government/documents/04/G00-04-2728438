  GEANIE (GErmanium Array for Neutron Induced Excitations) is the first
  large-scale, escape-suppressed, high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer to be
  used at a white neutron source. It is now installed at the WNR high-energy
  neutron facility at LANSCE. The operation and upgrade of GEANIE is a joint
  project of the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories, funded
  primarily by the Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship (SBSS) program. GEANIE
  currently consists of 20 high-resolution Ge detectors surrounded by BGO
  escape-suppression shields. Depending upon the experiment, roughly half of the
  Ge detectors used are of planar geometry for excellent resolution at low
  gamma-ray energies, and the others are coaxial for greater efficiency at
  higher gamma-ray energies. This instrument covers the gamma-ray energy range
  from below 20 keV to over 6 MeV. The array is located on a 20 meter flight
  path where neutrons are available with continuous energy coverage from below 1
  MeV to over 200 MeV. Neutron time-of-flight is used to determine incident
  neutron energies. Research is conducted by teams of national laboratory staff
  with collaborators from universities and other institutions. Current efforts
  are focused mainly on (n,xn) reaction measurements with actinide samples.
  Neutrons provide a unique probe for nuclear structure investigations allowing
  studies in heavier nuclei than are possible with charged particles, and
  complementing studies with heavy-ions by populating states with low to
  intermediate spins. Experiments addressing nuclear spectroscopy, nuclear
  reactions, and nuclear structure in previously inaccessible regions of
  excitation are in progress.
