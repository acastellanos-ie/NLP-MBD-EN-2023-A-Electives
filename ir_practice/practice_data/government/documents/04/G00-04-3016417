                  About HRSA's Bureau of Health Professions

     HRSA Bureau of Health Professions programs help to assure access to
     quality health care professionals in all geographic areas and to all
     segments of society. BHPr puts new research findings into practice,
     encourages health professionals to serve individuals and communities
     where the need is greatest, and promotes cultural and ethnic
     diversity within the health professions workforce.

     The Bureau of Health Professions has validated two approaches to
     health professions training that significantly increase the number
     of graduates choosing careers caring for underserved people:
     * Increase the diversity of health professions students
     * Focus on the primary care disciplines and expose students early and
       throughout their training to clinical practice in underserved
       areas.

     BHPr monitors workforce trends and protects the public through
     quality assurance data banks and programs that compensate
     individuals and families who have sustained injuries from childhood
     vaccines or acquired HIV through treatment for blood-clotting
     disorders.
