                           Introduction and Instructions

     FedLaw was developed to see if legal resources on the Internet could be a
   useful and cost-effective research tool for Federal lawyers and other Federal
     employees. Fedlaw has assembled references of use to people doing Federal
    legal research and which can be accessed directly through "point and click"
                              hypertext connections.
