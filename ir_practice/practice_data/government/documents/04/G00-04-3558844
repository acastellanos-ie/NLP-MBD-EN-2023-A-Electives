                         * Explanation of File Names

   The individual files of the WSOM (Weather Service Operations Manual)
   website are named and organized by issuance number. Since the home page
   represents the national (Headquarters) version of the WSOM, each file
   name begins with the letter "N", followed by an issuance number. Below
   is a brief description of the issuance number composition.

   The WSOM. is divided into several parts (A through J). Each part is
   represented by an alphabetic letter.
   Each Part is further broken down into a number of chapters. In
   addition, each chapter may consist of amendments or minor changes.
   These changes are issued in an Operations Manual Letter or OML.
    1. CHAPTER naming conventions
       The following is an example: NC419802 is a National level document,
       Part C, chapter 41. The remainder of the issuance number is the two
       digit calendar year, 98, followed by a sequential number, 02.
    2. OML naming conventions
       The following is an example: NC600288 is a National level document,
       Part C, chapter 60. The remainder of the issuance number is a
       sequential number, 02, followed by the two digit calendar year, 88.
