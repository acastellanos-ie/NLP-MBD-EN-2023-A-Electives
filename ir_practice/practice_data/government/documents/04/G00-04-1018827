   Please note: The Web Publisher, Search, and Agents links below are
   activated by enabling the corresponding feature in your Enterprise
   Server. If these links are inactive, ask your server administrator to
   use the Administration Server to enable that feature.

   NETSCAPE WEB PUBLISHER
   [fountainpen3.jpg] Web content authors can easily manage their files on
   a Netscape Enterprise Server by using the Netscape Web Publisher to
   publish and organize documents and directories. As documents are moved,
   renamed, and updated, the server automatically maintains and updates
   the links. Document control and versioning preserve document integrity
   in collaborative editing environments.

   SOPHISTICATED SEARCH
   [magnifier2.jpg] Search capabilities let users search the text content
   and the file properties of any document on the server. This provides
   great flexibility and precision. For example, a user can find all
   documents created within the last month that include the word revenue.
   Netscape Enterprise Server automatically handles content in various
   formats, including HTML, Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, and many others.

   ACCESS CONTROL
   [key4.jpg] Using Access Control, authors specify who can edit and view
   documents, enabling workgroups to manage and share critical
   information. Both administrators and web content providers can create
   flexible, Internet-ready access controls.

   INTELLIGENT AGENTS
   [hat4.jpg] Agents on Netscape Enterprise Server improve an
   organization's communication and efficiency by providing timely change
   notification and information to a user's attention. Both users and
   administrators (with valid user accounts) can create agents that run on
   the server and interact with the server's content.

   DEVELOPER AND ADMINISTRATOR FEATURES

   WE B APPLICATIONS
   [devplatform.gif] Developers can design applications that combine
   static and dynamic content, database access, and messaging. They can
   use C, C++, Java, and JavaScript for development, and HTTP and IIOP for
   communication. These applications use web resources with native
   database connectivity to Oracle, Sybase, Informix, DB2, and
   connectivity to other data sources through ODBC.

   CENTRALIZED SERVER MANAGEMENT
   [enterprise_sm.gif] Netscape Enterprise Server incorporates a broad set
   of management tools that significantly reduce the cost of managing and
   maintaining multiple web sites, including distributed administration.
   Maintaining users and groups for access control is more flexible
   through the Internet-standard directory service (LDAP).

   reference material, and more.
