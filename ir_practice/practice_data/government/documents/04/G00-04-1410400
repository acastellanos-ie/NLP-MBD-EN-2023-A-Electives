                  Tsunami Research Program

    The PMEL Tsunami Program seeks to mitigate tsunami hazards to Hawaii,
    California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. Research and development
    activities focus on improved tsunami inundation maps, other hazard
    assessment tools, and advanced technology to increase the speed and
    accuracy of tsunami forecasts and warnings.
