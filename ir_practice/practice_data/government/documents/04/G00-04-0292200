   This new web-based version of PACER extracts data from a database that
   is an up-to-the-minute replica of the live bankruptcy database that the
   court uses to administer bankruptcy cases. You will also find an image
   of the document in Adobe's Acrobat (PDF) format. To view the PDF
   images, you will need to download and install the Acrobat Reader
   software. To download your free copy of Acrobat Reader from Adobe's WWW
   site, select Get Acrobat Reader now.

   The cost to use this web-based version is $.07 per page. Access to our
   dial-up PACER will generate a $.60 per minute charge. Users will NOT
   incur both per minute and per page charges for a PACER session.
