THE VBA MISSION:

   The mission of the Veterans Benefits Administration, in partnership
   with the Veterans Health Administration and the National Cemetery
   Administration, is to provide benefits and services to the veterans and
   their families in a responsive, timely and compassionate manner in
   recognition of their service to the Nation.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE VBA VISION:

    "We are dealing with veterans, not procedures - with their problems,
                                 not ours."
                             Omar Bradley - 1947

   Our vision is that the veterans whom we serve will feel that our nation
   has kept its commitment to them; employees will feel that they are both
   recognized for their contribution and are part of something larger than
   themselves; and taxpayers will feel that we've met the responsibilities
   they've entrusted to us. Courage, honesty, trust, respect, open
   communication, and accountability will be reflected in our day to day
   behavior.
     __________________________________________________________________

VBA CORE VALUES:

     * Veterans have earned our respect and are our reason for being, our
       common purpose. All our efforts are directed toward meeting their
       needs.
     * We are committed to communicating to our veterans and among
       ourselves in a timely, thorough, accurate, understandable and
       respectful manner.
     * We openly share our concerns and views and listen to those of
       veterans in order to bring about improvements in benefits and
       services, and the climate in which they are provided.
     * We value understandable business processes which consistently
       produce positive results.
     * We foster an environment that promotes personal and corporate
       initiative risk-taking and teamwork.
     * We are open to change and flexible in our attitudes.
     * Respect, integrity, trust and fairness are hallmarks of all our
       interactions.
     * We value a culture where everyone is involved, accountable,
       respected and appreciated.
     * We will perform at the highest level of competence, always, and
       take pride in accomplishment. We are a "can do" organization.
