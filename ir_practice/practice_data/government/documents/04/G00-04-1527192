   Welcome to the Section of Community Health and Emergency Medical
   Services website.

   The Section includes a wide range of  public health programs including:
     * Programs to help improve access to primary care among rural and
       underserved populations;
       .
     * Promotion and surveillance of healthy lifestyle behaviors;
       .
     * Cardiovascular disease prevention;
       .
     * Tobacco use prevention and control;
       .
     * Injury prevention and surveillance;
       .
     * Emergency medical services and trauma care systems development; and
       .
     * Development of a system to educate and alert public health and
       health care providers through telecommunications.

   Planning, implementation, and evaluation of these programs involve a
   small number of state employees working with a large number of other
   agencies, organizations, and individuals at the federal, state,
   regional, and local levels.

   These programs address some of the major causes of disease, injury, and
   disabilities affecting Alaska’s population. Primary emphasis is on
   injury prevention and treatment (i.e. emergency care) and chronic
   disease prevention and treatment (e.g. cardiovascular disease and
   tobacco-related diseases).

   We welcome suggestions and comments from the general public, as well as
   from other public health and health care professionals to help us do a
   better job.

                                   Funding

   Approximately 50% percent of the funding for the Section is secured
   from federal grants. Although we welcome this level of funding support
   from the federal government, typically these grants are targeted to
   programs with specific priorities. Consequently, when our staff
   analyzes data on health status problems among Alaska’s people, or on
   problems with access to primary health care services, they often cannot
   identify a funding source to effectively address some of these priority
   issues. Even when a specific funding source is found, usually it is
   only available for a limited time, typically three years.
