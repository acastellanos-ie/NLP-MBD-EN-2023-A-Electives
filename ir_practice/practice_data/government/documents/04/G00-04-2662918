   Introduction
   Work on a new National Atlas of the United States^Â® began in 1997. This
   Atlas updates a large bound collection of paper maps that was published
   in 1970. Like its predecessor, this edition promotes greater national
   geographic awareness. It delivers easy to use, map-like views of
   America's natural and sociocultural landscapes. Unlike the previous
   Atlas, this version is largely digital.

   The new National Atlas includes products and services designed to
   stimulate children and adults to visualize and understand complex
   relationships between environments, places, and people. It contributes
   to our knowledge of the environmental, resource, demographic, economic,
   social, political, and historical dimensions of American life.

   This Atlas serves the interests and needs of a diverse populace in many
   ways, including:
     * as an essential reference,
     * as a framework for information discovery,
     * as an instrument of education,
     * as an aid in research,
     * and as an accurate and reliable source of government information.

   The updated National Atlas is designed to provide a reliable summary of
   national-scale geographical information. Though it cannot provide
   detailed map information, the Atlas directs users to other sources for
   this information.

   The web pages presented here on 'nationalatlas.gov' include the
   earliest products and services of the new National Atlas of the United
   States.
