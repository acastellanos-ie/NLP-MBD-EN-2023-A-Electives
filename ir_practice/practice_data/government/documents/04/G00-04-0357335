   "Believe me, my young friend, there is nothing -- absolutely nothing --
   half so much

   worth doing as simply messing about in boats." -- Kenneth Grahame
   (1859-1932)

   In the following pages, you will find information on the ways Cal
   Boating is working for you: protecting significant natural resources
   through its programs to provide for public access to the waterways, and
   promoting recreational boating safety. These programs include funding
   and designing the construction and improvement of boating facilities,
   beach erosion control, aquatic weed control, boating safety education,
   Clean Vessel Act grants, and supporting and training local boating law
   enforcement officers.
