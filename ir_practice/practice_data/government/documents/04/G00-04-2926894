   Senator Kennedy delivers speech on the 2002 Outlook to the National
   Press Club calling for a postponement of $350 billion of the worth of
   $1.35 trillion 10-year tax-cut income tax cuts scheduled to occur in
   2004. The Senator said only taxpayers with income of more than $130,000
   and those inheriting estates worth more than $4 million would be
   affected by his plan, which includespostponement of a reduction of the
   tax on the largest estates. "The spirit of this new time is placing
   major new demands on our nationalresources, and those demands must take
   priority," Kennedy saidremarks. "We cannot meet them while making all
   of the planned future taxcuts unless we raid Social Security and
   Medicare and cut health, educationand other vital goals."
