       The Howard Squadron Emergency Services/Organization Emblem was
                                conceived by
    CPT Elza Redman in 1988. The final patch design was completed by Maj.
                                    Kevin
   Redman and approved by Maryland Wing in May 1991. The objective of the
                                    patch
   was to show Howard Squadron's commitment to the CAP emergency services
   mission. The patch is worn in accordance with CAP Regulations by Howard
    Squadron members who have achieved full qualification in an emergency
                             services specialty.

            The eagle symbolizes the air search  function as well as the
                                qualities of
    mobility and quick response. It wears the earphones of a communicator
                                     and
      carries rope and a medic kit symbolizing the rescue function. The
                                 background
   shows a mountain, plain and coastline to show Howard Squadron's ability
                                     to
    respond anywhere in Maryland,  from the Appalachian mountains to the
                                   Central
     Maryland Piedmont to the Eastern Shore and Maryland coastline.  The
                                    motto
    "ALWAYS VIGILANT" is, of course, the CAP motto, demonstrating Howard
    Squadron's commitment to the 'anytime, anywhere' demands of emergency
                                  services.
