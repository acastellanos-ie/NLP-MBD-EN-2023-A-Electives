   The Los Alamos Accelerator Code Group (LAACG) is a national resource
   for members of the accelerator community who use and/or develop
   software for the design and analysis of particle accelerators, beam
   transport systems, light sources, storage rings, and components of
   these systems. On these pages we describe the LAACG's activities in
   high performance computing, maintenance and enhancement of Poisson
   Superfish and related codes. We also provide a multitude of related
   information. Users are encouraged to actively participate in the
   information provided from this site.
