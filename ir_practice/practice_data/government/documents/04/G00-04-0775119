   Welcome!

   Welcome to the home page for the Cryogenic Detector Development
   projects at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
   (managed by the University of California for the Department of Energy
   ).

   Our program focus is in research and development of low temperature
   photon and particle detectors for high resolution X-ray and gamma-ray
   spectroscopy, high-sensitivity UV and optical photon counting, and
   measurements of particles ranging from highly-charged ions to massive
   macromolecules.  We develop, test, and characterize advanced detectors
   based on superconducting tunnel junctions (STJ) and supeconducting
   transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters.

   Our work  supports the national security mission of  Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory in the area of nonproliferation and international
   security, and also the space science mission of NASA.
