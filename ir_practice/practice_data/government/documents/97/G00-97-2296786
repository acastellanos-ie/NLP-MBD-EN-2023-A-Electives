                                JURISDICTION:

     The Office of the Recorder of Mortgages is a public depository of
     documents that provides service to the public and legal profession.
     The office records all legal instruments in Orleans Parish (County)
     that effect the transfer of real estate (immovable) and/or private
     or commercial (movable) property.

     Recordation of original acts in Orleans Parish date to 1788. Most of
     the 18th & 19th century records are written in French and Spanish.
     All documents recorded before September 1987 are listed in card
     indices and those recorded after that date are cataloged on
     computer.

     The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Department records financing
     statements as a notice of security interest on movable property in
     Louisiana. The Orleans Parish UCC office accepts filings for every
     parish in Louisiana and from all states. UCC documents are
     computerized from January 1, 1990 to the present. Chattel Indices
     are available from 1985 - December 31, 1989.

     The public may freely research the records using the office's public
     computers and indices during normal business hours. Fees are
     assessed for filings, certificates, services, and copies.

     The Recorder of Mortgages, Hon. Desiree M. Charbonnet, and the staff
     are committed to maintain and preserve the integrity of the records
     at the highest quality so that the public is served efficiently and
     responsibly.
