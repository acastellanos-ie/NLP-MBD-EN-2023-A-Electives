   With a number of notable exceptions, historic properties in Western
   Washington appear to have withstood the Nisqually Earthquake relatively
   well, particularly given the 6.8 magnitude of the quake.

   OAHP has a limited number of publications available which may be useful
   to stewards of historic properties that either sustained damage during
   the event, or for those who wish to begin planning for future
   disasters. Among publications available here are Preservation Brief 41
   â€“ The Seismic Retrofit of Historic Buildings: Keeping Preservation in
   the Forefront; Temporary Shoring & Stabilization of Earthquake Damaged
   Historic Buildings; Earthquake-Damaged Historic Chimneys: A Guide to
   the Rehabilitation & Reconstruction of Chimneys; Disaster Management
   Programs for Historic Sites; Emergency Management Guide for Business &
   Industry; and the very comprehensive Seismic Retrofit of Historic
   Buildings Conference 1991 Report.

   For copies of any of these and other publications and any other
   assistance, please contact Stephen Mathison at (360) 586-3079  or Greg
   Griffith at (360) 586-3073.

   For information on financial and other assistance call the regional
   Federal Emergency Management Agency, (FEMA) hotline at 1-800-462-9029.
   FEMA grants are normally for public buildings only. However, grants up
   to $10,000 are available to homeowners to repair damages related to
   life safety issues. Assistance to commercial properties and other
   private residence related damage is primarily through low interest
   loans from the SBA (the Small Business Administration). SBA can be
   reached through the same hotline number listed above.

   Please also be aware that if a major repair and rehabilitation project
   becomes necessary as a result of the earthquake, the federal historic
   preservation tax incentive program offers a 20-percent tax credit for
   qualified projects on income producing properties that are listed in
   the National Register of Historic Places. For information on this
   program, contact Stephen Mathison.

   Finally, there is a wealth of information on the regional and national
   FEMA Internet websites at www.fema.gov which are linked to the OAHP
   website.
