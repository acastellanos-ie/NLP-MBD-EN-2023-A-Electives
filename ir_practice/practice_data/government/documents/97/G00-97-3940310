Privacy Policy

   Thank you for visiting the National Gallery of Art Web site and
   reviewing our privacy policy. As an independent establishment of the
   United States, the National Gallery of Art is not covered by the
   Privacy Act of 1974. As a matter of policy, however, the Gallery uses
   that Act as a guide in providing services to the public.

   We will collect no personally identifying information about you when
   you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to
   us. The information we collect depends upon what you do when visiting
   our site.

   If you visit our site to browse, read, or download, we automatically
   collect and store only the following information about you:
     * The IP address from which you access our Web site (an IP address is
       the number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever
       you are surfing the Web);
     * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
     * The date and time you access our site;
     * The pages you visit; and
     * The Internet address of the Web site from which you accessed our
       site

   We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
   visitors--to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
   types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
   information about individuals and their visits. We may compile and
   report aggregate statistics about our users--numbers, traffic patterns,
   and related site information--but these statistics will include no
   personally identifying information.

   If you identify yourself by sending an e-mail containing personal
   information:
   You may choose to provide us with personal information in an e-mail
   message to one of the addresses listed throughout our site (for
   example, webfeedback, art information, photo requests), or by filling
   out a survey form with your personal information and submitting it to
   us through our Web site. We use that information only to respond to
   your message and to help us provide you with the material you have
   requested.

   If you identify yourself by submitting customer information forms to
   purchase merchandise in our online Gallery shop:
   We do not collect or store any information about you that we gather
   from the customer information form (your name, address, telephone
   numbers, credit card information, and e-mail address). We use this
   information only to process your order.

   We do not collect or store any information about you that we gather
   from using "cookies" on our site. A cookie is a snippet of information
   that our server sends to your browser when you first visit our site.
   Our server uses cookies to let you build a shopping order in our online
   Gallery Shop. Each time you connect, your browser sends the cookie back
   to our server. We use cookies only to keep track of the items in your
   shopping order. We do not use cookies to determine where you have been
   or to store any information about you.

   Submitting your credit card number:
   When you submit your credit card number to purchase merchandise from
   our online Gallery Shop, we offer the use of a secure server. If you
   choose to use the secure server, the secure server software (SSL)
   encrypts the credit card information you submit before it is sent to
   us. This helps assure that the information is protected against
   unauthorized access.

   Site Security
   For site security purposes and to ensure that this Web site remains
   available to all users, the Gallery computer system employs software
   programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized
   attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
   Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
   the Gallery Web site are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by
   law.
