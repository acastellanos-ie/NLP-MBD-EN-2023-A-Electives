   Documenting the history of public government in Washington State

   A small but significant percentage of all state and local government
   records continue to have value long after they are needed in the office
   where they are created.  These archival records document the vibrant
   history of interaction between the citizens of Washington and their
   government, be it the governor, the legislature, state agencies, the
   courts, school districts, counties, cities, or other public entities.

   Most records are open to the public and may be accessed, in person,
   free of charge. See our historical research Q & A for more information.

   Promoting efficient records management Most records have a short but
   useful life and are destroyed according to an official schedule.  The
   Division of Archives and Records Management helps government offices
   create and implement those schedules.  Keeping records on schedules has
   many benefits, such as the following:
     * helps make government more efficient by making it easier for
       offices to find the most current and accurate information in a
       timely manner;
     * saves tax-payer money by lessening the need for expensive storage
       space or technology (learn about the State Records Center);
     * enhances government accountability by preventing the untimely
       destruction of vital information.
