   Nuclear Reactors

   Regulated Reactors

        * Power Reactors - commercial reactors for generating electric power
          (power plants)
        * Non-Power Reactors - reactors used for research, test, and training

   Regulated Activities

      For general information, see the How We Regulate page. For details on
      activities we regulate, see the following:
        * Operating Reactors
        * Reactor Decommissioning

   Responsibilities

      The Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation has overall responsibility for
      NRC's reactor program. NRC's Regional Offices (Region I - Northeast,
      Region II - Southeast, Region III - Midwest, and Region IV -
      West/Southwest) implement this program in the states for which they are
      responsible. Reactor regulation is also supported by a Nuclear Reactor
      Research program and by independent advice from the Advisory Committee
      on Reactor Safeguards.
