     opportunities, press releases, or online databases, we collect and
           store only the following information about your visit:
     * The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
       example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online

     collect information through the use of web browser cookies, unless
    noted on a particular web page. With the exception of web access and
   email log data that is collected from all visitiors, we do not collect

     For SITE MANAGEMENT, information from web access and email logs is
     collected for statistical purposes. This Government computer system
   uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for
     such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different
    sections of our site, what information is of most and least interest,
     determining technical design specifications, and identifying system
                        performance or problem areas.

                               Security Notice

     For SITE SECURITY purposes and to ensure that this service remains
       available to all users, this Government computer system employs
   software programs to monitor network traffic, to identify unauthorized
     attempts to upload or change information, and to prevent denial of
         services attacks or other attacks intended to cause damage.
   Unauthorized modification of any information stored on this system may
                       result in criminal prosecution.
