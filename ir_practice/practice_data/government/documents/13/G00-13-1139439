Privacy Policy

   Thank you for visiting the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) Web
   site, and for reviewing our Internet privacy policy. The privacy
   policy, in brief, is clear: We collect no personal information about
   you when you visit this site unless you choose to provide it to us. Any
   information that we receive depends upon what you do when you visit the
   site. Further details of the policy are provided below.

Our Internet Privacy Policy Is:

     * You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site.

     * If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Web
       site, reading or downloading information (such as forms and
       publications), our system gathers and stores certain information
       about your visit automatically. This information does not identify
       you personally. The system collects and stores the following
       information about your visit:

     * the Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com," if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yschool.edu" if you connect
       from a universityÂ’s domain) and Internet Protocol (IP) address from
       which you access our Web site (an IP address is a number
       automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service
       provider);

     * the date and time you access our site;

     * the pages you viewed or files you downloaded;

     * the length of time that you are connected to our site; and

     * if you linked to our Web site from another site, that site's
       address.

       We use this information for statistical purposes (e.g., to
       determine the number of visitors to different sections of the site,
       and areas of particular interest to visitors), and to help us
       understand how to improve the content and navigation of the site.
       We do not track or record information about individuals and their
       visits.

     * We do not use "cookies." (A "cookie" is a file placed on your hard
       drive by a Web site that allows it to monitor your use of the site,
       usually without your knowledge.)

     * If you choose to use this site to send an e-mail message with
       personal information (e.g., your name, e-mail address, telephone
       number, mailing address, or other unique identifier) to the Hatch
       Act Unit or USERRA (Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
       Rights Act) coordinator, we may use the information that you give
       us to answer your message, to ask for clarification of a request or
       comment, or to help us provide you with information that you asked
       for (including from third parties, if necessary). Records of e-mail
       inquiries will be disposed of in accordance with National Archives
       and Records Administration guidelines.

     * We do not give, sell, or transfer personal identifying information
       to third parties for commercial marketing purposes.

     * Unauthorized attempts to change or destroy information on this Web
       site, or to upload information onto the site, are strictly
       prohibited. Such activities may be punishable under the Computer
       Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, and the National Information
       Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996. Except for possible law
       enforcement investigations of these activities, no efforts will be
       made to identify individual users or details of their visits.

     * We will only disclose system or personal information to third
       parties (including other government agencies) in accordance with
       the Privacy Act or other applicable federal law. In the vast
       majority of cases, disclosures will consist of statistical reports
       about usage of the site to senior OSC staff, the Office of
       Management and Budget, and Congress.

In Summary, If You Visit The OSC Web Site . . .

     * . . . to read or download information: You do not have to give us
       your name or other personal information. Our system will collect
       and store information about your visit for statistical purposes, in
       connection with analyses of and reports on usage of the site.

     * . . . to download forms: When you download a form, a Privacy Act
       statement about our use of any information that you may provide
       appears on the form. [Note: Forms cannot be completed and sent to
       us directly from our Web site. If you want to use a form found on
       the site, you need to download the form and mail it to the OSC.]

     * . . . to send us an e-mail: In sending an e-mail request for an
       advisory opinion to the OSC Hatch Act Unit, or a question to the
       USERRA coordinator, you may be providing us with personal
       information in the caption or body of the message (e.g. your name,
       address, e-mail address). We may use that information to research
       and respond to your message. [Note: E-mail is not necessarily
       secure against interception. If your communication is very
       sensitive, or includes sensitive information, such as your social
       security number, you might want to send it by postal mail instead.)

     REGARDLESS OF ANY INFORMATION SENT TO THE OSC, WE WILL PROTECT THE
             INFORMATION CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW.
