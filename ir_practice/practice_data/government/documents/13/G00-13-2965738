   How to Search DisabilityDirect.gov
   DisabilityDirect.gov provides a simple search facility to find
   resources across all categories in our database. You can enter specific
   keywords or phrases in the box at the upper right of every page and
   decide if you want all words listed to appear in the found resources or
   any of the words.

   For example, searching for Wheelchair will find any resources with the
   word "Wheelchair" in the title or description. Searching for wheel
   chair with the "all" button selected will find any resources with both
   words in the title and/or description (but not any with "wheelchair" as
   searches look for whole words, not part of them. "Wheel" will never
   find "wheelchair"). Searching for wheel chair with the "any" button
   selected will find any resources with either "wheel" or "chair" in the
   title or description.

   If you perform a search and get back too many matches, you should
   perform a new search and use more specific keywords. For example,
   employment is likely too general a search but employment disability
   policy with "all" selected is much more specific and will likely return
   more useful results.
