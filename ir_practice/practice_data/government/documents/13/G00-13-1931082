                          SPDBV - Import functions
     __________________________________________________________________

   The "Import" utility of SPDBV allows you to connect directly to a
   spdbv-server, thereby providing direct access to huge databases and
   powerfull computing facilities.

   Before using this service, you have to fill the "Network preferences"
   correctly. The following SPDBV-servers are curretly available. Please
   choose the one closest to your location:

              NOTE: The IP-Number for this service has changed!

                                        IP-Number or server name Port
                Switzerland:
             DeepView 3.6 / 3.7              213.39.71.210       27000

      Deep View 3.7x

                                              www.gwer.ch        27000
                    USA:                 - not yet available -

   Currently, the spdbv server supports the the following download
   functions:
     * PDB files
     * ExPDB files
     * SwissProt entries
     * SwissProt sequences
     * Simple key word search for PDB entries: Instead of the PDB ID you
       can type a keyword. Several keywords can be combined by boolen AND
       (+) and NOT (-). E.g.
       +CRAMBIN -NMR
       The server will then provide a list of possible PDB entries. You
       can download entries by clicking on the IDs (colored in red).
