                                 [DMMap.gif]
   DIRECTION : Del Mar is easy to find from either I-5 or Highway 101. In
   either case youÂ’ll take Via de La Valle, on the boundary between Solana
     Beach and Del Mar. The track is located between the highway and the
            freeway. The main entrance is off Jimmy Durante Blvd.
