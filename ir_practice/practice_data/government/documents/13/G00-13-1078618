                      CMB Astrophysics Research Program

             UC Berkeley - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

   Professor George Smoot's group conducts research on the early Universe
 (cosmology) using the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) and other
astrophysical sources. These investigations are directed towards realizing a
     variety of science goals regarding CMB. Post doctoral, Graduate and
  undergraduate student, and other job opportunities, pending funding, are
                 available in the various research projects.

                                   Projects:
     __________________________________________________________________

   [prj_cobe.gif] COBE: satellite data analysis on the anisotropy and
   spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and on infrared emission
   from Galactic and extragalactic sources.
   [prj_max.gif] MAX, MAXIMA and BOOMERANG: balloon-borne CMB anisotropy
   high resolution mapping experiments and the new MAXIPOL balloon-borne
   CMB polarization instrument version.
   [new.gif] New Results from MAXIMA

   [prj_cosa.gif] Planck Surveyor: formerly called COBRAS/SAMBA is a
   satellite proposed to extend the COBE DMR work.
   It completed Phase A feasibility study in May 1996, and has been
   selected for a mission by ESA (European Space Agency) in July 1996.
   [mincer.gif] CMB Data Processing, Analysis and Computing: is a major
   effort in collaboration with COMBAT and work work utilizing the NERSC
   Supercomputer Center.
   [forecast_s.jpg] CMB Foreground Estimation and Realistic Modeling
   including the FORECAST and WOMBAT collaborations.
   [prj_gem.gif] GEM: the Galactic Emission Mapping project. A radio
   survey of Galactic emission.
   [snapsats.jpg] SNAP satellite project to determine many cosmological
   parameters and do related astrophysics. SNAPsat

   [prj_neut.gif] Neutrino Astrophysics: Projects designed to detect high
   energy neutrino such as IceCube .
   [prj_spec.gif] Former Projects: such as the U2 jet aircraft borne
   experiment that detected the CMB dipole anisotropy and this one to
   measure the long wavelength spectrum of the cosmic microwave
   background. This was done at a number of sites including the South Pole
   pictured there.
