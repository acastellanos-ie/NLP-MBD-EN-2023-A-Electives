   SUBJECT: 2002-2003 Building Aid Data TIME SENSITIVE MATERIAL. PLEASE
   REVIEW IMMEDIATELY. Chapter 383 of the Laws of 2001, enacted on October
   29, 2001, established a new method of apportioning aid for debt service
   on capital projects based on the concept of assumed amortization. For
   projects associated with any existing bonds, bond anticipation notes or
   lease- purchase agreements that have principal remaining as of July 1,
   2002, the Commissioner is directed by statute to apply an assumed
   amortization to determine the amount of building aid and reorganization
   incentive building aid that will be payable on such debt service in the
   2002-03 school year and thereafter. To make that computation possible,
   Part F of Chapter 383 directs the Commissioner to determine the
   "remaining maximum useful life" of the project or projects associated
   with any bonds, bond anticipation notes or lease-purchase agreements
   that were entered into in order to fund projects approved by the
   Commissioner prior to December 1, 2001 where the obligation was first
   issued prior to July 1, 2002 and there will be outstanding principal as
   of July 1, 2002. The same legislation further states that "school
   districts shall provide on or before the fifteenth day of January, two
   thousand two, such data as the commissioner shall deem necessary to
   estimate the apportionment payable under assumed amortization." While
   most of the data necessary to estimate payments under assumed
   amortization can be extracted from district data on file with the
   Department, we do not have complete information as to the maximum
   useful life of the projects. Moreover, on the basis of past efforts to
   obtain this data from school districts as part of a statewide survey,
   it would appear that not all districts have this information readily
   available. As a result, the Department has developed a methodology to
   impute the maximum remaining useful life of a project, based on the
   types of expenditures reported by districts as being associated with
   specific projects. We have used that methodology to estimate the
   blended maximum useful life to be associated with debt still
   outstanding as of July 1, 2002 and the assumed amortization that would
   be the basis for apportionment of aid. That data for your district can
   be accessed through the State Aid Unit website at
   http://stateaid.nysed.gov/, and a description of the methodology used
   to arrive at the imputed maximum remaining useful life is enclosed as
   Attachment A. Unless we receive information from school districts that
   documents different maximum useful lives for these projects, the
   imputed maximum useful lives that have been developed and appear in the
   data on the State Aid website will be used to compute aid. If you feel
   that the imputed maximum remaining useful life for any project is
   inaccurate, please provide the Office of Facilities Planning with
   documentation of the maximum useful life of the project as determined
   under generally accepted accounting principles for municipalities by an
   appropriate engineer, architect or other professional, as appropriate.
   Such documentation should be forwarded or emailed no later than January
   15, 2002 to: David Clapp Room 1060 EBA New York State Education

   ATTACHMENT A The methodology used to impute the blended maximum
   remaining useful life of the projects associated with any given debt is
   as follows: 1. To determine the blended maximum useful life of a given
   project: a. If the project is new construction or if there are no costs
   allocated for additions or for alterations and reconstruction, it is
   assigned a maximum useful life of 30 years. b. If the project is an
   addition and the total costs for alterations and reconstruction are
   less than 10% of the total costs for additions, it is assigned a
   maximum useful life of 20 years. c. For all other projects, a weighted
   average maximum useful life is calculated in accordance with section
   11.00 of the Local Finance Law, by adding the following: (1) 15 years
   multiplied by the dollar amount allocated to alteration and
   reconstruction, and (2) 20 years multiplied by the dollar amount
   allocated to additions. This sum is then divided by the total dollar
   amount allocated to all purposes and rounded to the nearest half year.
   EXAMPLE: A project has $2.5 million allocated for
   alteration/reconstruction and $6 million allocated for an addition. The
   weighted maximum useful life is ((2,500,000 * 15) + (6,000,000 * 20)) /
   (2,500,000 + 6,000,000), or 157,500,000 / 8,500,000 = 18.529 or,
   rounded to the nearest half year, 18½ years. 2. To determine the
   blended maximum useful life of a given debt issuance, the same
   methodology is used. a. For each project associated with a debt issue,
   a weighted maximum useful life is calculated by multiplying the
   allowable cost of that project to be funded with the proceeds of that
   issuance by the maximum useful life associated with that particular
   project. b. The weighted maximum useful lives for all the associated
   projects are summed and the sum is divided by the total allowable costs
   for all the associated projects, rounded to the nearest half year. c.
   If this calculated life is less that the original term of the bonds,
   the original term is considered the maximum useful life of the debt.
   Otherwise, the blended maximum useful life is used. EXAMPLE: A $3.5
   million bond with 3 projects associated with it was issued 10 years
   ago, for a term of 15 years. New Alteration/ Est. Max Weighted
   Allowable Constructi Additions Reconstr. Useful Useful Cost on Costs
   Cost Cost Life Life Project 1 2,658,285 0 2,271,296 386,989 19.5
   51,836,558 Project 2 56,003 0 0 56,003 15.0 840,045 Project 3 282,597
   282,597 0 0 30.0 8,477,910 Total for All Proj. 2,996,885 61,154,513 The
   estimated maximum useful life for the bond is the sum of the weighted
   useful lives of the projects divided by the sum of the allowable costs
   for the projects, or ((2,658,285 * 19.5) + (56,003 * 15.0) + (282,597 *
   30.0)) / (2,658,285 + 56,003 + 282,597) = 61,154,513 / 2,996,885 =
   20.406. Rounded to the nearest half year, this is 20½ years, so the
   remaining maximum life for the bond is this calculation, rounded to the
   nearest half year less the period that has elapsed since the bond was
   issued, or 20½ years  10 years = 10½ years. 3. Once the maximum
   remaining term is established, it is used in conjunction with a
   statewide average interest rate (or, in the case of the Big Five, an
   average interest rate for the city) as determined by the Commissioner
   and the principal outstanding as of July 1, 2002 to calculate the
   assumed annual debt service cost. Assuming that in the example above,
   the average interest rate is 5.25% and the bond has outstanding
   principal of $3.5 million, the district's aid would be allocated based
   on two assumed payments of debt service per year that, over 10½ years,
   would retire the $3.5 million of outstanding principal at an interest
   rate of 5.25%. Under these conditions, the assumed annual debt service
   cost would total $437,855. 4. This assumed annual debt service is then
   multiplied by the bond percent assigned to that debt issuance to
   compute aidable debt service. If the bond percent is 85.62%, in the
   above example, the aidable debt service would be $437,855 * 85.62% =
   $374,891. 5. The aidable debt service is then multiplied by the
   district's aid ratio previously assigned to that particular bond issue
   to compute the actual aid apportionment for that debt. If the
   district's aid ratio in the above example is 57.9%, the aid
   apportionment would be $374,891 * 57.9% = $217,061.89.
