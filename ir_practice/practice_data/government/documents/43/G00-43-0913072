   About the Sanctuary Log


                                                          [subatdusk.jpg]

           The DeepWorker will host many pilots. Read their updates in the
                                                            Sanctuary Log.

   Welcome to the Sanctuary Log of the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, where
   you can follow NOAA's National Marine Sanctuary team during the 2000
   field season. In 1999, the SSE team visited nine of NOAA's 12 national
   marine sanctuaries. This year, they will visit a 10th sanctuary -- the
   Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary -- and
   revisit three -- the Channel Islands, Monterey Bay, and Florida Keys --
   for an extended period of time. They will also explore an area that is
   not a sanctuary, known as the West Florida Shelf.

   Last year it seemed that every day of the expeditions held adventure,
   opportunity, or disappointment, and these experiences were captured in
   the Log. Science and discovery are this year's themes, and expectations
   are high.

   Track the expeditions above and below the sea.
   But our silent partner, the sea, can be harsh when it comes to human
   expectations. The only certainty is that there will be more adventures
   and the participants will continue to share their stories as they
   unfold, here in the Sanctuary Log. Select the sanctuary of your choice
   to review background information, follow day-to-day happenings, and
   read a series of informative logs.

   Background: This field season, the background essays discuss the
   specific goals and objectives of each sanctuary's SSE education and
   research projects. They describe the types of dives and events, and the
   importance of these activities to the ongoing work of the sanctuary.
   Other background essays describe particular research and education
   topics, such as krill or fish habitat, that relate to the particular
   thrust of an expedition.

     Sanctuary staff and partners will submit a series of reports from the
                                                                    field.

   A customized marine forecast, biographies, maps, and the essays
   developed for the 1999 field season are also included.

   Expedition Update: Follow the daily updates in the center of the
   Sanctuary Log page for the most current information available on each
   mission. A member of the SSE team will provide a brief update every day
   of the expedition. More information often can be found in the log
   entries.

   Sanctuary Log: The 2000 Sanctuary Log is a chronological set of
   reports, written by expedition participants, on ongoing SSE research
   and education efforts. Most logs also include several mission-specific
   photos. A set of summary materials will also be offered after each
   mission is completed.
