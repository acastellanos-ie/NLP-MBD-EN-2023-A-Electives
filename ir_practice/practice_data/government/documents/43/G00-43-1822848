                         Discovery of the Top Quark

   Ever since the existence of the bottom (or b ) quark was inferred from
   the discovery of the Upsilon family of resonances at Fermilab in 1977,
   particle physicists have been on the lookout for its partner, called
   top (or t ). The long search, which occupied experimenters at
   laboratories around the world, came to a successful conclusion in
   February 1995 with the announcement that the top quark had been
   observed in two experiments at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider
   at Fermilab.

   Top is the last of the fundamental constituents of subnuclear matter
   that theories of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions and
   a wealth of experimental information had led particle physicists to
   expect. Theoretically, top's existence was required to make the
   electroweak theory internally consistent. Experimentally, the top's
   existence was signalled by the pattern of disintegrations of the b
   quark and by the way b  quarks interacted with other particles via the
   exchange of Z  bosons. A year before the formal discovery, a growing
   body of observations pointed to the existence of a top quark with a
   mass of about 180 GeV/c^2. Finding top there emerged as a critical test
   of the understanding built up over two decades.

   Creating top-antitop pairs in sufficient numbers to claim discovery
   demanded exceptional performance from the Tevatron, at 1.8 TeV the
   world's highest-energy collider. Observing traces of the disintegration
   of top into a b  quark and a W  boson required highly capable detectors
   and extraordinary attention to experimental detail. Both the b  and the
   W  are themselves unstable, with many complex decay modes.

   Each of the Fermilab detectors is a complex apparatus operated by an
   international collaboration of about 450 physicists. The tracking
   devices, calorimeters, and surrounding iron for muon identification
   occupy a volume about three stories high and weigh about 5000 tons. The
   Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), a magnetic detector with
   solenoidal geometry, profited from its high-resolution silicon vertex
   detector to tag b   quarks with good efficiency. The DØ detector has no
   central magnetic field, emphasizing instead calorimetric measurement of
   the energies of produced particles.

   Both groups found events in which one or both W s decayed into an
   electron or muon, plus a neutrino. A significant number of these events
   showed evidence for one or two b quarks as well. Taken together, the
   populations and characteristics of different event classes provided
   irresistible evidence for a top quark with a mass in the anticipated
   region: 178 ± 8 ± 10 GeV/c^2 for CDF(1) (the first uncertainty refers
   to that due to the statistical size of the data sample, while the
   second refers to that due to systematic uncertainties, which include
   imperfect knowledge of the detectors, theoretical modeling, and
   algorithms for estimating the mass); and 199 ± 20 ± 22 GeV/c^2 for
   DØ.(2) Meanwhile, the top-antitop production rate was in line with
   theoretical predictions.

   Top is a most remarkable particle, even for a quark. Although a single
   top quark weighs about as much as an atom of gold, we expect that it is
   structureless down to a scale of at least 10^-18 m. Its expected
   lifetime of about 0.4x10^-24 s makes it by far the most ephemeral of
   the quarks, and opens new possibilities for the study of quark
   dynamics.

   Because of the great mass and short lifetime, it is popular to say that
   top quarks were produced in great numbers in the fiery cauldron of the
   Big Bang, that they disintegrated in the merest fraction of a second,
   and then vanished from the scene until physicists learned to create
   them in the Tevatron. To learn how it helped sow the seeds for the
   primordial universe that evolved into our world of great complexity and
   change would be reason enough to care about the top. But this cosmic
   role is not the whole story; it invests the top quark with a remoteness
   that veils its importance for the everyday world of today. The real
   wonder is that here and now, every minute of every day, the top quark
   affects the world around us.

   For example, by virtue of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, top
   quarks and antiquarks wink in and out of an ephemeral presence in our
   world. Though they appear virtually, fleetingly, on borrowed time, top
   quarks have real effects. Of immediate interest to particle physicists
   is the influence of top on the mass of the W  boson, which regulates
   the rate of radioactive decay and the rate of energy production in the
   Sun. Rapidly improving measurements of both the top mass and the W
   mass set the stage for another incisive test of the electroweak theory.

   The standard model suggests that the electroweak force separated into
   the separate electromagnetic and weak forces in the early universe, and
   that the Higgs boson bestowed a great mass on the W  and Z  bosons, the
   carriers of the weak force, while allowing the photon, the carrier of
   the electromagnetic force, to remain massless. But what is the mass of
   the Higgs itself? Because the W  mass is fine-tuned by the influence of
   the Higgs boson, particle physicists hope that better estimates of the
   top mass and the W  mass will narrow the range of possible masses for
   the Higgs boson.

   Like the end of many a scientific quest, the discovery of top marks a
   new opening. The first priority, with the doubled event samples that
   will be in hand by the end of 1995, is to refine the measurements of
   the top mass. It is already possible to begin asking how precisely the
   top conforms to prior expectations as to its production and decay
   rates. Also, because of top's great mass, its decay products may
   include unpredictedor at least undiscoverednew particles. A very
   interesting development would be the observation of resonances in
   top-antitop production that would give new clues about the breaking of
   electroweak symmetry.

   For the moment, the direct study of the top quark belongs to the
   Tevatron. By 1999, samples 20 times greater than the current samples
   should be in hand, thanks to the increased event rate made possible by
   Fermilab's main injector and upgrades to CDF and DØ. In addition,
   further improvements to the accelerator complex are under study.
   Furthermore, early in the next century the Large Hadron Collider at
   CERN will produce tops at more than 10,000 times the rate seen in the
   original discovery experiments. Also, electron linear colliders may add
   new opportunities for the study of top-quark properties and dynamics.

   In the meantime, the network of understanding of elementary particle
   interactions known as the standard model links the properties of top
   quarks to a variety of phenomena to be explored in other experiments.
