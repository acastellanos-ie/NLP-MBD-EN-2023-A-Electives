                            WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
                      ABOUT CONSERVATION & LIQUIDATION

   The California Department of Insurance takes a leading role to
   conserve, rehabilitate or liquidate licensed California financially
   distressed and insolvent insurance companies under appointment by the
   courts, thereby helping to secure consumer interests and provide for a
   stable, consistent insurance market.

   What Is Conservation & Liquidation?

   The purpose of the Conservation & Liquidation Office (CLO) is to
   protect policyholders whose insurance companies are experiencing severe
   financial problems. In order to assist insurance consumers, the
   Commissioner applies to the Superior Court of California for a
   conservation order to place a financially troubled company in
   conservatorship. When the Commissioner becomes the conservator of a
   company, an investigation by the CLO is initiated to determine if the
   company can be rehabilitated. Every effort is made to enable the
   company to regain a strong financial footing. However, if it appears
   that the company cannot be saved at the time of liquidation or at a
   later date, then the Commissioner applies for a court order to
   liquidate the company.

   Why Liquidation?

   When a liquidation order is issued, the insurance company is closed,
   all outstanding policies are cancelled, and the process of selling the
   company's remaining assets begins. The goal of liquidation is to use
   the money acquired from selling the company's assets to pay off the
   company's debts and outstanding insurance claims.

   How Is Liquidation Achieved?

   Upon issuance of a liquidation order, the CLO publishes a notice to the
   company's policyholders, creditors, shareholders and all parties
   interested in the company's assets. The notice requests proofs of claim
   to be filed with the CLO before the final claims filing date published
   in the notice of liquidation. In 1998, somewhere between $364 and $800
   million will be distributed to claimants. The exact disbursement of
   these funds depends on the claims made on them.

                                                    distributions


   Are There Any Guarantees?

   The California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) and the
   California Life and Health Insurance Guarantee Association (CLHIGA)
   have been established to meet the obligations of insolvent insurers by
   administering and disbursing covered claims. The valuation of each
   proof of claim is determined in accordance with policy provisions and
   statutory requirements. Generally, recovery will not be 100 percent.
   Valid policyholder claims that are either not covered by the insurance
   guarantee associations or are in excess of the limits paid by the
   insurance guarantee associations are administered by the CLO.

   Are There Other Refunds Owed?

   Although the larger distributions bring more attention, the CLO
   continues to liquidate assets in 73 other estates. As this process
   continues, there will be more distributions to claimants in California.
   Over the last four years, the CLO has closed 37 estates and will
   continue to close more in 1998. Unfortunately, not all of these estates
   have assets available for the payment of claims. In many of these
   instances, the claimants are paid by CIGA and CLHIGA.

   The CLO has become one of the premier receivership operations in the
   country and will continue to manage the affairs of conservatorship and
   receivership in California for the benefit of policyholders.
