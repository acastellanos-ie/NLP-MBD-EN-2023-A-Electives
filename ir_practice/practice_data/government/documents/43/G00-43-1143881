   Short-Term Energy Outlook - January 2002
   January 8, 2002 Release (Next Update: February 6, 2002)

   Crude Oil Price chart Overview

   World Oil Markets. OPECs decision to go forward with an additional oil
   production quota cut of 1.5 million barrels per day beginning January 1
   revealed the Cartels preference for price support over market share
   maintenance in the face of weak near-term world oil demand conditions.
   The strategy, ostensibly to be reviewed at the next ministerial meeting
   in March, may require signs of renewed strength in the industrialized
   economies and in world oil demand despite potential price strengthening
   (before the year 2002 gets too old) to be deemed successful. We believe
   that the cuts, which are consistent (more or less) with what has been
   assumed in the Outlook over the last few months, will result in oil
   prices moving up gradually from the average levels seen in December
   over the course of 2002. The West Texas Intermediate price, which stood
   at $19.40 per barrel in December, is expected to move to about the
   $25-$26 range by the end of 2002 and to remain at about that level
   through 2003 (Figure 1).

   Weather Update. December weather proved to be warmer than normal on
   average (by about 12-13 percent based on heating degree-days) despite
   some cold temperatures across the Midwest and Northeast at the close of
   the month. Comparisons between December 2001 and December 2000 are
   stark, with reductions in degree-days ranging from 25 percent to 35
   percent, depending on the region. This development, which continued the
   warm trend seen in November, is reflected in lower estimated heating
   fuel demand and higher end-period inventories for the fourth quarter of
   2001, particularly for natural gas.

   U.S. Natural Gas Markets. Relatively low levels of heating demand
   related to the abnormally warm weather during the last quarter of 2001
   have left natural gas inventories more in excess than previously
   expected. We estimate that as of December 31, working gas in storage
   was approximately 2860 billion cubic feet, 1.1 trillion cubic feet (66
   percent) above the year-ago level and 19 percent above the average for
   the previous 5 years. The last time such a high end-year storage total
   was seen was during the early 1990s, when a succession of very mild
   winters and a weak economy prevailed. This reinforces the expectation
   that gas production may fall in 2002, since incremental domestic supply
   will not be needed as long as storage returns to more normal levels by
   year-end.

   Energy Expenditures Update. The sharpest annual increase in aggregate
   energy expenditures in the United States in 20 years was witnessed in
   2000. Nominal expenditures for energy throughout the economy increased
   by about 29 percent between 1999 and 2000. (The average rate of growth
   in nominal energy expenditures between 1987 and 1999 was 3.0 percent).
   On average, the higher expenditure level was maintained in 2001. The
   outlook for 2002 suggests a drop in nominal expenditures of about 11
   percent. The decline would put nominal expenditures back at trend
   levels (Figure 2). While expenditures as a percent of GDP spiked
   sharply in 2000, for the 2002-2003 period the expenditure share appears
   headed for the declining trend line observed since the early 1990s
   (Figure 3). A significant portion of the lower expenditures is accruing
   to households in the form of lower heating bills and lower motor fuel
   expenses. With regard to heating fuel expenses, we have updated our
   estimates of household heating bills for selected fuels (Figure 4),
   with the benefit of being halfway through the heating season. Our base
   case household heating bills calculations show the following
   expectations for the six-month period ending next March 31 compared to
   the 2000-2001 heating season: a 39-percent reduction in average natural
   gas heating bills per gas-heated household in the Midwest; a 28-percent
   falloff in oil-heated household heating costs in the Northeast, and a
   32-percent decline in comparable expenditures for households using
   propane for heating in the Midwest.

   International Oil Markets

   Crude Oil Prices. World oil prices in December fluctuated around
   November levels as markets waited to see whether OPEC and key non-OPEC
   suppliers could come to an agreement on supplies and avert a price war.
   The U.S. average imported crude oil price in December was estimated at
   about $16 per barrel, while the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
   crude oil price averaged a little over $19 per barrel (Figure 1). The
   OPEC basket price was also roughly the same as in November, averaging a
   little under $18 per barrel. World oil prices are expected to firm in
   2002 as the new supply cuts by OPEC and others take effect on January
   1. West Texas Intermediate prices are projected to reach $25-$26 per
   barrel by the end of 2002 and remain in or near that range through
   2003.

   International Oil Supply and Demand. After making three production
   quota cuts, totaling 3.5 million barrels per day in 2001, OPEC members
   were understandably reluctant to lose further market share to non-OPEC
   members. OPEC warned other oil suppliers that a price collapse could
   result if they didn't participate with OPEC in another round of supply
   cuts. After much negotiation, OPEC pronounced that pledges of supply
   reductions from Angola, Norway, Oman, Mexico and the Russian Federation
   totaling 462,500 barrels per day were enough to satisfy OPEC, and OPEC
   announced that it would cut an additional 1.5 million barrels per day
   from its production quotas beginning January 1, 2002. Even with this
   agreement, EIA's Outlook assumes that non-OPEC production will increase
   by about 1 million barrels per day in 2002.

   EIA's global oil demand projections for 2002 suggest world oil demand
   growth of 700,000 barrels per day, slightly less than in its previous
   Outlook (Figure 5). With the expected recovery of the global economy by
   end-2002, oil demand could increase by as much as 1.3 million barrels
   per day in 2003 over 2002's level, with about half of this coming from
   the United States. For 2002-2003, worldwide jet fuel demand is still
   assumed to be about 5-7 percent below what would have been expected
   prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks.

   OECD commercial oil stocks continued to rise above last year's
   extremely low levels, reaching over 100 million barrels higher at
   end-2001 than a year ago. With the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC
   producers to reduce world oil supplies for the next 6 months, these
   additional stocks are projected to be worked off as OECD commercial
   stocks decline toward the lower end of their normal range by mid-2002,
   building support for firmer world oil prices (Figure 6). In 2003, this
   upward price pressure is expected to ease as additional OPEC production
   capacity comes on-line over the next 2 years in Algeria, Kuwait, Libya,
   the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela, increasing the potential for
   these countries to produce above quota levels.

   U. S. Energy Prices

   Gasoline Prices: Until just recently, pump prices had been collapsing
   across the U.S. Three weeks ago, motor gasoline prices (when adjusted
   for inflation) were only a few cents per gallon higher than the lowest
   pump prices seen in well over 20 years. Since then, motorists have seen
   their gasoline prices rebound by an average of 2 cents per gallon per
   week, due to a bump up in the cost of crude oil and spot motor gasoline
   prices. Until the last two weeks of December, retail motor gasoline
   prices had been on a steady downward slope since mid-September. The
   September monthly average price for regular retail gasoline was $1.52
   per gallon. As of December 17, the retail price for regular gasoline
   averaged $1.06 per gallon, which was the lowest weekly survey price
   since March 22, 1999 (Figure 7). In some parts of the country, motor
   gasoline was selling for less than $1.00 per gallon in early December.

   Last spring's gasoline price of $1.70 per gallon was the highest price
   in real terms since the Gulf War and the highest price in nominal terms
   ever recorded. Several factors pushed this average down. First, crude
   oil prices have decreased by about $9 per barrel (22 cents per gallon)
   since last May. An even stronger impact has been the crash in refiner
   spreads (the difference between the refiner price and the price of
   crude oil). These spreads had plummeted by 40 cents per gallon during
   the same period (Figure 8). Admittedly, back in May, these refiner
   price spreads were at unusually high levels. Driving normally slows
   down at this time of year--in other words demand is currently down--but
   supply is up--inventories of gasoline are hovering near the high end of
   the "normal" range (Figure 9). As a consequence, refiner spreads have
   compressed. Unless the economy erodes faster than previously projected
   and/or world crude oil prices collapse, prices are expected to increase
   at the pump. If our base crude oil price path holds, and barring any
   major supply disruptions, we expect pump prices to gain about 20 cents
   per gallon by late spring from the $1.09 average observed in December
   2001. The upsurge in gasoline demand and the seasonal transition to
   reformulated gasoline that typically occur during the driving season,
   coupled with rising crude oil prices, are projected to result in an
   average driving season retail price of $1.30 per gallon, which is about
   25 cents per gallon lower than prior year levels. In 2003, motor
   gasoline prices should gain about 8 cents per gallon on an annual basis
   as crude oil prices are expected to rise slightly and the economy to
   grow.

   Distillate Fuel Oil (Diesel and Heating Oil): Under normal
   circumstances, heating oil and diesel prices both would have gained
   during the fourth quarter of 2001, since demand for distillate fuel
   grows during the heating season. However, the retail prices for both of
   these fuels had been slipping over the early course of this heating
   season. Residential heating oil prices crept up over the last two weeks
   of 2001 as the weather turned colder and as crude oil prices inched up.
   Nevertheless, the same factors that have lowered gasoline prices, i.e.,
   generally falling crude oil costs and a sluggish economy, have also
   kept the lid on the price of distillate fuels . Furthermore,
   unseasonably warm weather in the Northeast (where 75 percent of the
   nations home heating oil is consumed) from October through
   mid-December greatly reduced demand, pushing inventories of distillate
   fuel to robust levels. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the weather in
   the Northeast was 26 percent warmer compared to the fourth quarter of
   2000, or 19 percent warmer than "normal". Nevertheless, the retail
   price should see some modest gains over the next few weeks and months
   as we enter the coldest part of the winter (Figure 10) . Prices could
   rise more rapidly than anticipated if the weather turns unusually cold
   or if world crude prices rebound quickly. Assuming normal weather and
   our base case world oil price path, heating oil and diesel prices are
   projected to be about 25-30 cents per gallon lower this winter compared
   to year-ago levels.

   At the end of November, a time for close seasonal scrutiny of the
   distillate situation, distillate stocks were 18 million barrels above
   last year's levels (Figure 11) . Almost all of this year-over-year
   inventory growth was on the East Coast, the region most sensitive to
   distillate stock changes. We estimate that total U.S. inventories
   finished 2001 at about 136 million barrels, leaving stocks within the
   "normal" range. This level is about 15 percent above last years level.
   Another dynamic that may moderate distillate fuel prices this winter is
   the current and near-term natural gas price and supply situation. High
   inventory levels of natural gas should help keep a lid on distillate
   fuel prices in markets where the potential for fuel-switching is high.
   During the previous winter, very high natural gas prices resulted in
   significant fuel switching, which caused upward pressure on all
   distillate product prices.

   Natural Gas Spot Prices chart Natural Gas: Spot wellhead prices are
   currently averaging around $2.30-$2.50 per thousand cubic feet. One
   year ago, natural gas spot wellhead prices averaged well above $8.00
   per thousand cubic feet in response to cold weather and critically low
   inventories. Since last February, these prices have been steadily
   eroding. A number of factors have caused the price to tumble. To begin
   with, this descent started from a very high point. Spot gas prices
   attained record levels back in December and January which boosted
   drilling and gas production at the same time that they stifled demand,
   particularly in the industrial sector. Within a few months, mild summer
   weather and a slowing economy reinforced reduction in gas consumption
   when compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the buildup to a
   currently strong state of petroleum inventories combined with tepid
   petroleum product prices have helped lower the ceiling for natural gas
   prices should the winter turn harsh, particularly in the electric power
   sector.

   Although prices at the wellhead may increase as the weather gets
   colder, we believe that large price gains are unlikely this winter,
   given the high volume of gas presently in storage. Working gas in
   underground storage at the end of November was 30 percent above last
   year's level. Due to the warm weather, which lasted up to the middle of
   December, we estimate that working gas in storage was 66 percent above
   the previous years end-of-year level at the end of 2001. In the base
   case, we project that natural gas wellhead prices will peak at about
   $2.50 per thousand cubic feet, then fall throughout the latter part of
   winter (Figure 12) . For the year 2002, assuming normal weather and
   barring any major supply disruptions, the annual average natural gas
   price is projected to be about $2.00 per thousand cubic feet, or less
   than half of last years price, as sluggish industrial demand and
   robust underground storage levels keep a lid on prices. For 2003, we
   project that, as the economy recovers, world oil prices rise, and as
   the negative effects on aggregate gas productive capacity of sharply
   reduced drilling become apparent, natural gas wellhead prices will
   respond to the upward pressure, increasing by about 60 cents per
   thousand cubic feet on average compared to 2002.

   Electric Utility Fuels: For most of the forecast period, natural gas is
   expected to be the more price- competitive fuel compared to heavy oil
   (Figure 13). However, toward the end of 2003, this advantage may
   disappear if winter weather and the assumption of continued economic
   growth raises the price of gas above the price of heavy oil. Coal
   prices should continue to drift downward though 2003 as mining
   productivity keeps gaining.

   U.S. Oil Demand

   In 2001, total domestic petroleum products demand averaged an estimated
   19.66 million barrels per day, representing a year-to-year decline of
   40,000 barrels per day, or 0.2 percent (Figure 14). Although that
   estimate is subject to revisions culminating in final data to be
   published in the Petroleum Supply Annual in the spring, 2001 appears to
   be first year since 1991 in which total petroleum products demand has
   fallen.

   Nonetheless, two major fuels -- motor gasoline and distillate fuel oil
   -- experienced continued growth in 2001, even after the terrorist
   attacks. Demand for motor gasoline increased 1.5 percent for the year
   as a whole and 1.8 percent for the (post-terrorist attack) fourth
   quarter. Available data, in fact, indicate a pick-up in demand growth
   to 2 - 3 percent in the two months following the attacks. The switch
   away from air travel appears to have temporarily bolstered demand for
   gasoline during that period, but available data for December indicate
   flat demand or even slightly negative year-over-year growth.

   Jet fuel is the petroleum product most negatively affected by the
   events of last September 11. The immediate impact of those events was
   the precipitous decline in air activity, and, hence, jet-fuel demand.
   After a virtual shutdown of the airline system for several days, air
   carriers resumed operations in stages but implemented flight
   curtailments averaging 20 percent of pre-attack levels. As a result,
   commercial jet-fuel demand during the (post-attack) fourth quarter was
   down more than 18 percent, or 220,000 barrels per day, from the same
   period last year. Total air activity (i.e. passengers and freight)
   during that period was down almost 20 percent. That implies even lower
   load factors than those preceding the terrorist attacks, despite air
   carriers efforts to trim capacity.

   For the year as a whole, total jet fuel (commercial, military and
   diesel blendstock) declined almost 4 percent, reflecting a 6-percent
   contraction of commercial aviation demand. Even prior to the terrorist
   attacks, however, commercial jet fuel demand had been stagnant since
   the beginning of the year. Passenger-mile growth had virtually come to
   a halt; cost-saving efforts resulted in substantial decline in freight
   activity as customers switched to ground transportation; new
   fuel-efficient commercial aircraft was used to retire older equipment
   as well as for fleet expansion; and air-capacity growth slowed during
   the year.

   Distillate fuel demand, in contrast, appears to have registered growth
   in 2001 of more than 3 percent. Inasmuch as the bulk of the 2001 growth
   in distillate fuel occurred early in the year, it is clear that the
   prime factor involved was high natural gas prices and fuel switching in
   the power generation and industrial sectors. The negative industrial
   output picture through most of 2002 and lower natural gas prices drive
   the expected decline of 3.7% in distillate demand this year.

   Despite substantial declines in prices during the year, residual fuel
   oil demand staged only a slight increase in 2001. Sizable increases in
   winter power-generation purchases offset declines in purchases by the
   weakening industrial sector but power-generation purchases in the
   latter half of the year also exhibited a decline as natural gas, whose
   prices continued to fall from their earlier record highs, regained
   market share.

   During the forecast interval (January 2002 to December 2003), total
   petroleum demand is expected to increase once again, with the recovery
   beginning in the second half of this year. In 2002, total petroleum
   demand growth is projected to average 145,000 barrels per day, or 0.7
   percent. Following a first-half decline of about 100,000 barrels per
   day, second-half demand growth is projected to average 400,000 barrels
   per day. In 2003, petroleum demand is projected to increase to 540,000
   barrels per day, or 2.7 percent, and annual average petroleum demand is
   expected to exceed 20 million barrels per day for the first time.

   Motor gasoline demand is projected to continue to increase throughout
   the forecast interval, with growth averaging between 1.5-2.0 percent,
   similar to projected growth in highway activity. Nonetheless, that is
   still less than the projected average growth in real disposable income
   of 2.9 percent. During the course of the forecast period, commercial
   air activity is expected to recover, with progressive reversals of the
   late 2001 curtailments from 20 percent to 5 percent. As a result, total
   jet fuel demand during the first half of this year is still projected
   to decline by 6 percent, led by a 9-percent reduction in commercial
   aviation demand, but recover at a 5-percent rate starting in the second
   half of this year. Distillate fuel oil demand, however, is projected to
   continue to decline throughout the current year before recovering in
   2003. The temporary lift to diesel demand brought about by the previous
   years events is expected to subside, and industrial recovery (on a
   year-over-year basis) is expected to start later in the year. Next
   year, demand for the fuel is expected to expand by more than 4 percent
   as the recovery in industrial activity accelerates. Residual fuel oil
   demand is projected to slide about 14 percent in 2002. Most of that
   decline stems from the reversal of last winters fuel switching (during
   which natural gas prices were still near their record highs). In 2003,
   demand for residual fuel oil is expected to be close to the 2002
   average. Oil prices are expected to recover somewhat, thwarting any
   meaningful recovery in residual fuel oil demand.

   U.S. Oil Supply

   Average domestic oil production is expected to decrease by 71,000
   barrels per day or 1.2 percent in 2002, to a level of 5.78 million
   barrels of oil per day. For 2003, a 2.3 percent decrease is expected
   and results in a production rate of 5.64 million barrels of oil per day
   average for the year.

   Lower-48 States oil production is expected to decrease by 49 thousand
   barrels per day to a rate of 4.83 million barrels per day in 2002,
   followed by a decrease of 158 thousand barrels per day in 2003 (Figure
   15). Shells Brutus Federal offshore platform is expected to peak in
   oil production at 100 thousand barrels per day in 2002. Oil production
   from the Mars, Troika, Ursa, Dianna-Hoover and Brutus Federal offshore
   fields is expected to account for 9.7 percent of the lower-48 oil
   production by the fourth quarter of 2003.

   Alaska is expected to account for 17.2 percent of total U.S. oil
   production in 2003. Alaska oil production is expected to decrease by
   2.4 percent in 2002 and increase by 2.0 percent in 2003. The increase
   in 2003 results from the addition of new Alaska north slope satellite
   fields, Colville River (Alpine), Prudhoe Bay (Aurora), Polaris, and
   Borealis. Initial rate from Alpine averaged 74,000 barrels per day
   during March 2000, and it exceeded 100,000 barrels per day in August
   2001. Another satellite field, North Star, is expected to come on in
   early to mid-2002 and will peak at a rate of 65,000 barrels per day
   later in the year. Production from the Kuparuk River field, plus like
   production from West Sak, Tabasco, Tarn, and Meltwater fields, is
   expected to stay at an average of 220,000 barrels per day in the 2002
   and 2003 forecast periods.

   The Baker Hughes oil and gas rig count for 2000 averaged 917. EIA
   estimates that the rig count increased to an average of 1138 in 2001.
   It is expected to decrease to 732 in 2002 and increase to 850 in 2003.

   Natural Gas Demand and Supply

   The sharp downturn in domestic gas-directed drilling rates since July
   (Figure 16) will probably not reduce natural gas productive capacity
   enough to prevent relatively low prices this winter and through most of
   2002, but could have important implications for market prices by 2003.
   The quite robust amount of demand growth we are currently projecting
   for 2002 (an increase of 1.2 trillion cubic feet, or 5.5 percent) will
   probably return natural gas inventories to normal. Thus, pressure on
   domestic wellhead prices to remain near $2 per thousand cubic feet will
   be strong through much of 2002. In 2003, the expected rebound in
   economic growth should result in further demand growth of about 2.0
   percent and somewhat higher spot gas prices, averaging about $2.70 per
   thousand cubic feet.

   For all of 2001, natural gas demand is estimated to have declined by
   5.3 percent. Although residential demand is estimated have declined for
   2001 based on weak heating-related demand in the fourth quarter, the
   overall demand decline was mainly the result of the downturn in
   gas-intensive industrial production (Figure 17). Natural gas use for
   power generation, on the other hand, increased by an estimated 4.1
   percent in 2001, entirely because of increased use by nonutility
   generators.

   Based on EIA survey data and recent information from the American Gas
   Association on early-season storage additions, we estimate that, on an
   EIA survey basis, working gas in storage at the end of December was
   2,858 billion cubic feet. Storage is well above last year's level and
   also above the previous 5-year seasonal range (Figure 18). As storage
   levels have risen, spot natural gas prices have fallen. In December,
   spot natural gas prices averaged about $2.47 per thousand cubic feet
   (mcf) compared with an average of $8.36 in December of 2000.

   Heating season temperatures for most of fourth quarter were above
   normal, causing withdrawals from storage to be delayed. If temperatures
   are assumed to be normal for the rest of this winter, then heating
   degree-days for the entire 2001-2002 winter season would be about 14
   percent lower than last winter. As a consequence, winter demand for
   natural gas is projected to decline by 7.3 percent compared with growth
   of 6.4 percent last winter. Spot natural gas prices, which averaged
   $6.48 per thousand cubic feet last winter, are expected to be
   two-thirds lower this winter at about $2.20 per thousand cubic feet.
   Residential and commercial demands for natural gas are expected to be
   lower than last winters levels by 14.3 and 7.9 percent, respectively.
   In the case of both the residential and commercial sectors, the fact
   that November/December heating degree-days (HDD) averaged more than 30
   percent below those same months a year ago is a significant factor in
   the recent demand picture. In the commercial sector the flat economy is
   an additional factor. Industrial gas demand, which was under downward
   pressure all through 2001, is projected to begin to rise in the first
   quarter of 2002. This expectation is seen as the result of the reversal
   of significant fuel substitution away from natural gas that occurred
   last winter and, further into 2002, of the gradually reviving economy.

   We now expect domestic natural gas production to fall by about 400
   billion cubic feet in 2002 (2.1 percent) and to recover to about 2001
   levels in 2003. Production increased approximately 1.7 percent in 2001.
   After reaching a high of 1,058 rigs drilling during the month of July,
   the rig count has been falling since then due to the drop in natural
   gas prices and declining industrial demand. Net imports of natural gas
   are projected to rise slightly in 2002 but should exhibit solid growth
   (about 10 percent) in 2003 as import capacity expands.

   Electricity Demand and Supply

   Total annual electricity demand growth (retail sales plus industrial
   generation for own use and other direct sales) is estimated to have
   been flat in 2001, but to revive slightly to 0.8 percent in 2002, and
   by a further 2.4 percent in 2003. This is compared with estimated
   demand growth in 2000 of 2.8 percent over 1999's level. Electricity
   demand growth is expected to rise in the forecast years (Figure 19)
   mainly because the economy is assumed to gradually rebound.

   Electricity demand in the industrial sector in 2001 was adversely
   affected by the overall economic slowdown, particularly as illustrated
   by falling industrial output. In 2002, growth in industrial demand for
   electricity (including estimated net industrial own-use generation) is
   expected to be about flat in contrast to the estimated 6.1 percent
   contraction seen in 2001. This category of demand growth is expected to
   exhibit (approximately normal) growth of 3.0 percent in 2003 as the
   economic recovery proceeds. In 2003, growth in residential and
   commercial demand for electricity is expected to be 2.6 percent and 1.4
   percent, respectively, due mainly to assumptions of normal weather and
   fairly solid increases in commercial activity. This winter, total
   electricity demand growth is expected to be negative (down 3.1 percent)
   compared with last winter's demand growth of 4.7 percent due to a
   weaker industrial economy compared with last winter, the relatively
   warm fourth quarter of 2001 and the assumption of normal weather
   through the remainder of the winter.
