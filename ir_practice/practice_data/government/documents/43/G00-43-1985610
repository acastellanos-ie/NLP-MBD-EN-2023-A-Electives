   The Treaty of February 2, 1848 established the United States-Mexico
   international boundary. The treaty of December 30, 1853 modified the
   boundary as it exists today.

   The Convention of July 29, 1882established another temporary commission
   to resurvey and place additional monuments along the western land
   boundary from El Paso, Texas/Ciudad Ju치rez, Chihuahua to San  Diego,
   California/Tijuana, Baja California.

   The Convention of November 12, 1884 established the rules for
   determining the location of the boundary when the meandering rivers
   transferred tracts of land from one bank of the river to the other.

   The Convention of March 1, 1889 established the International Boundary
   Commission (IBC) to apply the rules in the 1884 Convention and was
   modified by the Banco Convention of March 20, 1905 to retain the Rio
   Grande and the Colorado River as the international boundary.

   The Convention of May 21, 1906   provides for the distribution between
   the United  States  and Mexico of the waters of the Rio Grande in the
   international reach of the river between the El Paso-Ju치rez Valley and
   Fort Quitman, Texas.

   In the Convention of February 1, 1933, the two  governments agreed  to
   jointly construct, operate and maintain, through the IBC, the Rio
   Grande Rectification Project, which straightened, stabilized and
   shortened the river boundary in the El Paso - Ju치rez

   The Treaty of February 3, 1944 Water Treaty for  the  "Utilization of
   Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande"
   distributed the waters in the international segment of the Rio Grande
   from Fort Quitman, Texas to the Gulf of Mexico.  This  treaty also
   authorized the two countries to construct operate and maintain dams on
   the main channel of the Rio Grande. The 1944 treaty also changed the
   name of the IBC to the International Boundary And Water  Commission
   (IBWC), and in Article 3 the two governments entrusted the IBWC to give
   preferential attention to the solution of all border sanitation
   problems.

   The Chamizal Convention of August 29, 1963 resolved the 100 year old
   boundary problems at El Paso, Texas/Ciudad Ju치rez, Chihuahua, known as
   the Chamizal Dispute. The Commission relocated  and  concrete-lined 4.4
   miles of the channel of the Rio Grande so as to transfer 437 acres to
   Mexico.

   The Treaty of November 23, 1970 resolved all pending boundary
   differences between the two countries, and provided for maintaining the
   Rio Grande and the Colorado River as the  international boundary. It
   provides procedures designed to avoid the loss or gain of territory by
   either country incident to future changes in the cou  Copies of these
