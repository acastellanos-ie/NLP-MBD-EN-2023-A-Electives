        Web Site Privacy Statement for the VA Sierra Pacific Network

                       Our Internet privacy policy is:
     * We consider "personally identifying information" to be your name or
       a unique identifier (such as an IP address, Internet email address,
       mailing address and telephone number).
     * Our system temporarily logs IP addresses, domain names, and search
       requests. This information is destroyed after 90 days of
       collection. We use this information for statistical purposes only,
       to determine the areas of our web site that interest users, and to
       help us understand how to improve the navigation and content of our
       web site.
     * Personally identifying information that you provide will be used
       only for such purposes as are described at the point of collection,
       such as to respond to your questions or comments. If you provide
       contact information, VA Sierra Pacific Network staff or designated
       contacts with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) may inquire
       to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your level
       of customer satisfaction with our services.
     * We do not sell any personal information to third parties.
     * We may transfer personal information to a third party only in the
       following cases:
          + A company, that agrees not to sell or use personal information
            for other purposes, is contracted to assist us with specific
            services; or
          + We suspect that your use of our web site is in violation of
            Federal or local laws, and we decide to provide personal
            information to legal authorities.
     * Although questions, comments, and other communications that we
       receive generally are not retained as permanent records, please
       note that it is possible that any mail--electronic or paper--that
       we (or any Federal agency, for that matter) receive could become
       part of the permanent record of the agency, if the mail is part of
       materials that are scheduled for permanent retention.
