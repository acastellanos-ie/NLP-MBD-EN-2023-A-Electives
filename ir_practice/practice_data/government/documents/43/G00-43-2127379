     Employment Information
    The VA Boston Healthcare System, the largest consolidated facility in
    VISN 1, encompasses 9 campuses within a 40-mile radius of the greater
    Boston area. The consolidated facility consists of the Jamaica Plain
    campus, located in the heart of Boston's Longwood Medical Community;
    the West Roxbury campus, located on the Dedham line; and the Brockton
    campus, located 20 miles south of Boston in the City of Brockton. In
    addition to the 3 main medical centers, 6 Community Based Outpatient
      Clinics (CBOCs) located in Worcester, Framingham, Lowell, Quincy,
       Dorchester, and Causeway Street (Boston) make up the VA Boston
                        Healthcare System (VA BHCS).

   The VA Boston Healthcare System was officially united in March of 2000,
   with the consolidation of the former Boston VA Medical Center, and the
   Brockton/West Roxbury VA Medical Center. The leadership team is headed
    by Mr. Michael M. Lawson, Director and CEO; William J. Burney, Acting
      Associate Director; Dr. Craig N. Karson, Chief of Staff; and Ms.
   Cecilia McVey BSN, MHA, CNA, Associate Director for Nursing and Patient
     Care Services. There were 666,362 outpatient visits made and 13,659
   inpatients treated in Fiscal Year 1999 with a total operating budget of
      $314,948,582 million dollars. Overall, more than 50,000 patients
                    received medical services in FY 1999.

       The VA Boston Healthcare System, fully accredited by the Joint
   Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO),
   serves as the major tertiary and surgical referral center for all other
      VA facilities in New England. The VA BHCS offers a comprehensive
    spectrum of clinical services to the veterans of Eastern and Central
                               Massachusetts.

    All three main medical centers that make up the VA Boston Healthcare
            System are linked by a transportation shuttle system.

   Veterans receiving care at the VA Boston Healthcare System have access
   to the Telephone Assistance Program (TAP) which operates Monday through
    Friday, 8AM to 4PM and is available to answer questions regarding the
    VA Boston Healthcare System and their personal medical questions. The
                TAP program can be reached at 1-800-865-3384.

    During the coming months and years we anticipate continued expansion
    into primary care and comprehensive ambulatory care services. We will
     continue to serve the veteran population by providing high quality
    medical care in a cost efficient manner while supporting the mission
                           and vision for VISN 1.

                                  Research

      Research is an integral part of the VA Boston Healthcare System's
      mission and plays a key role in enhancing the healthcare services
   provided to our veteran population. The total Research and Development
     Program for the three campuses, Brockton, West Roxbury and Jamaica
      Plain, is one of the largest and most active in the VA system. In
   recent years, total intramural VA funding has been in the range of $15
   million. Extramural research funding from other federal agencies, such
    as NIH and DOD, private proprietary companies, voluntary agencies and
           foundations have added another $10 12 million per year.

      As a referral center for neuropsychiatric disorders, the Brockton
     campus has major research efforts in the neurophysiology of mental
    illnesses, problems in alcoholism and sleep problems associated with
      many mental disorders. The research interests at the West Roxbury
   campus, as the acute tertiary care division, spans several fields, with
        a strong focus on gastrointestinal disorders, cardiology and
      cardiovascular diseases, hematology, pulmonary medicine, urology,
      neurology, and spinal cord injury. At the Jamaica Plain campus in
    conjunction with the Boston Outpatient Clinic, there are significant
        research projects on hemostasis, aphasia, language and memory
           disorders, PTSD and infectious diseases, among others.

   Investigators at both the Brockton campus and the Jamaica Plain campus
   have been participating in a major VA cooperative studies trial on the
   National Health Survey of Persian Gulf War Veterans and Their Families.
   There are several special emphasis programs and research centers at the
    VA Boston Healthcare System, including the Massachusetts Epidemiology
   Research and Information Center, the Normative Aging Study, the Dental
      Longitudinal Study, NIDA/VA Medication Development Center, and a
    National Center for PTSD. There are also several programs in the area
   of Rehabilitation Research and Development and Health Services Research
    and Development, with the VA's HSR&D Management Decision and Research
      Center, located at the Jamaica Plain Campus. There is very active
    participation on all campuses in many of the VA's Cooperative Studies
                    Program multi-center clinical trials.

                            Academic Affiliations

     VA Boston Healthcare System maintains strong affiliations with the
     world's renowned medical schools, which are an integral part of the
      operation of this facility. These include major affiliations with
      Boston University Medical School, and Harvard Medical School. In
      addition nursing and other allied health students from different
      institutions receive training at this institution annually. These
      include programs in laboratory technology, radiologic technology,
    radiation therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, optometry,
     audiology, speech pathology, social work, psychology, pharmacy, and
    physician assistants. Through this close affiliation, the veterans at
   all campuses receive the most up to date, state of the art medical care
                             that is available.
